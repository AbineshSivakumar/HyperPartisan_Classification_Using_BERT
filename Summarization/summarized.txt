---  David Cay Johnston won a Pulitzer Prize in 2001 for his exposes of tax loopholes and inequities in the US tax code . His awardwinning investigative journalism has taken him through the arcane legislation and regulations to expose how corporations and the wealthy rig the system in their favor . Johnston has written a trilogy of books on our procorporate tax system the most recent The Fine Print How Big Companies Use Plain English to Rob You Blind . He also writes regular columns for Al Jazeera America Tax Analysts and a weekly piece for Newsweek . He has also edited the forthcoming book Divided The Perils of Our Growing Inequality . He is a lifelong journalist and bestselling author whose recent work explores the causes and conditions of inequality in the U.S. In this Reality Asserts Itself we usually start off with a personal story of our interview subject and thats what were going to do. We usually start with a story of the interview subject. We are happy to talk to our interview subjects. Youre born in San Francisco in 1948 and your mother was a disowned heiress the only child of a very wealthy businessman She testified against him in a trial in Marchamp1601941 where he was being sued for alienation of affection. She is the only daughter of a wealthy businessman  When I was a senior in high school and I was married and I had a kid the local weekly paper which was always shooting my picture asked me to write a column and offered to pay me a little bit of money020 an inch . They liked it so pretty soon they had me covering the school board and the city council for minimum wage . And one day at the county board of supervisors meeting when I was 18 years old a reporter from The San Jose Mercury who was filling in for the local guy who was off on vacation slides down the bench next to me asking whats going on during the break takes me to a coffee shop I literally dont have a penny in my pocket and I have a hole in the bottom of my shoe . And the following day he told me he had arranged a job interview for me at The San . Jose Mercury as a reporter nine months later they hired me JAY Before we pick up that storywere jumping further ahead I want to back up Johnston .

---  Max Blumenthal is an awardwinning journalist and bestselling author whose articles and video documentaries have appeared in many publications . His most recent book is Goliath Life and Loathing in Greater Israel . The Real News Network is continuing our series of interviews with author Max Blumenthal about his new book . In the previous sections of the interview weve been talking about the far right and the center and their policy of expulsion of Arab citizens of Israel of Israel . In this series we talk about the Israeli Prime Minister who would not overtly talk this way these days but at the root of his thinking he seems to not be in a different position than the others we have covered in this series Heres a quote from Maxs book like every Israeli PM before him Netanyahus strategy depended on increasing number of Jews living on Israelicontrolled territory and reducing the number of Palestinians . The Iron Wall laid out the strategic deterrence strategy of the Israelis which is pure colonialism using kind of a strategy of pure force because they could never make peace with the indigenous Arab population . And so they will have to suppress them through violence And then Netanyahu comes under pressure from Washington to negotiate the Hebron accords with Arafat and then turned back on their view of their base on the back on the Accron .  Two weeks ago Netanyahu went back to BarIlan University to give another major national security speech . He declared that the Palestinians are the heirs to Nazi Germany that they are directly responsible for the Final Solution . He said that for us to make peace we have to first remove the poisonous tumor of antiSemitism from the Palestinians . He used the word kibbush or occupation with a sarcastic tone to suggest that Palestinian resentment of the state of Israel has nothing to do with occupation or colonialism . This is dangerous rhetoric considering the amount of mob violence targeting Palestinians and nonJewish Africans and you hear this rhetoric from the leader of Israel Words have consequences. Netanyahu occupies the hollow center and he has no choice but to consistently move to his right to mollify the rightwing base . The Labor Party under the control of Shelly Yachimovich focuses on things like the price of cottage cheese and the national insurance system and is bunkering in Tel Aviv and Haifa and has relieved Netanyahu of any pressure from his left JAY. It has been so successful that he no longer has to pretend that he believes in two states anymore. Netanyahu at least has had a strategy to counter the pressure from Washington and maintain the status quo beneath peace talks . He has had to counter .
---  Mitt Romney claims President Barack Obama8217s spending amounts to an 8220inferno8221 as Mitt Romney says . The truth is that the nearly 18 percent spike in spending in fiscal 2009 8212 was mostly due to appropriations and policies that were already in place when Obama took office . Obama increased fiscal 2009 spending by at most 203 billion accounting for well under half the huge increase that year . Spending under Obama remains at a level that is quite high by historical standards but receipts are running at levels that are well below historical averages . Combination of historically high spending and low revenues that is producing the current string of trilliondollar annual deficits and piling up debt . The White House has promoted a May 22, 22, column by Rex Nutting of the Wall Watch website that concluded that a binge that never happened and raised how raised and never happened . The Wall Street Journal website concluded that it never raised and raised the 8220federal spending is rising at the slow pace since Eisenhower Dwight Eisenhower . The Washington Post has also concluded that Obama never raised at the low pace since Dwight Eisenhower did not raise the pace since the Eisenhower era . The Post concludes that Obama's administration has never raised the pace of spending in the past two decades. The Post concluded that the White House  Obama8217s spending has increased only modestly since fiscal 2009 . Inflation has been extraordinarily low during Obama's term and inflation is low during his term . CBO projected on June 5 that by the end of the year the federal debt will reach roughly 70 percent of GDP GDP the highest percentage since shortly after World War II8221 All of the yearly changes under Obama are well below the 7 percent average annual increase under Bush prior to fiscal 2009 And in that year 8212 for which we assign most of the increase to Bush the rise amounted to a staggering 179 percent . Future spending levels are impossible to predict with any accuracy . Congress has yet to pass a single one of the 12 regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year starting Oct 1 and it remains to be seen whether Congress will undo automatic cuts in military and domestic spending enacted in last year . Supreme Court is considering whether or not to strike down the harsh health care law . The legal debt ceiling is looming looming looming debt showdown is looming . The House Speaker John Boehner has declared that 8220I again insist on my simple principle of cuts and reforms greater than the debt limit increase .

---  Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 never really mattered what happened in the cockpit that day . It was however a tale with thrilling upsides when it came to filling airtime especially on cable news . The same has been true of the story that in the US came to vie with it for the top news spot the devastating mudslide in Washington State . Both stories had the added benefit for TV of an endless stream of distraught relatives teary or weeping or weeping in desperately tight closeups making heartfelt pleas for more information . For the media it was like the weather before climate change came along. In response just about anything else that could pass for news was swept aside. The media that normally rushes heedlessly from one potential 247 story to another this was striking . The Ukraine story was so front and center that it sent opinion pollsters scrambling and they promptly discovered that halfof all Americans thought we were indeed living through the Cold War redux. It had the overwhelming media narrative that we were living through an old order of an oldfashioned script of an Oldfashioned one whose ending implied that the world was finally back in order to grasp everybody in order. It implied that everybody already knew that everyone already knew everything was finally in order and that everybody was finally to grasp that .  British journalist Patrick Cockburn pointed out something genuinely unnerving about our world . Cockburn concludes that the Global War on Terror has visibly failed and alQaedatype jihadis once confined to a few camps in Afghanistan today rule whole provinces in the heart of the Middle East . The world as Dick Cheney ampamp Co took for granted looked ready to be dominated by the only angry hyperpower left after centuries of imperial rivalry . The US is not in a new Cold War its troops do not stand in any danger of going toetotoe with Russian invaders and a twosuperpower world is dead and buried but so it seems is a one superpower world . The Greater East is in chaos The US seems incapable of intervening in a meaningful way about anywhere on Earth . Despite changing American attitudes on foreign interventions and future involvement abroad it is perhaps why why why it hasn't been more unexpected for those in power in Washington and perhaps for Americans generally . This is perhaps perhaps the latest crises around the latest events around Syria and Iran had previously had previously been previously seen as they had previously in Iran and Syria . The latest events in Syria and Syria have been unexpected and perhaps they couldn't have been more surprising for Americans in power for those who are generally generally in Washington
---  Taxpayers subsidize the oil industry by as much as 48 billion a year . Big five oil companies get an average tax break of 334 on every barrel of domestic crude they produce . Oil and gas companies and their employees have pumped more than 357 million into federal candidates8217 campaigns since 1990 with 4 out of every 5 going to Republicans . The Depletion Allowance allows oil producers to deduct 15 percent originally 275 percent of any gross income from a well and 275 percent is taken off the top with no taxes . In the post-Citizens United era oil and gas executives can pour unlimited money sometimes anonymously into races . This makes many lawmakers wary of crossing Big Oil and oil backed darkmoney groups like the American Petroleum Institute the American Energy Alliance and the Chamber of Commerce spent tens of millions on ads attacking President Obama8217s energy policies . The industry employed 796 lobbyists last year . In 2012 Chevron gave 25 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund a superPAC devoted to expanding the Republican majority in the House and oilbacked dark money spent on ads against President Obama and other energy policies. The industry has spent 14 billion on lobbying more than 14 billion in the past 15 years. In 2010 the industry employed more than 700 lobbyists. In 2012 the industry. in  The oil and gas industry insists that it doesn8217t receive any government handouts . Its favorite giveaways are tax expenditures buried in the tax code . To protect these tax breaks the oil industry doesn't have to convince lawmakers to do something it has to convince them to do nothing . Few politicians want to untangle the wonkiness of decadesold tax loopholes . Environmentalists and reps from both parties say the best shot at curbing the tax breaks is to tackle the entire tax structure . Lowering corporate taxes could easily compensate for the loss of the current tax breaks and if a tax overhaul never gets off the ground the industry will be content with the status quo . Ted Cruz has shown his loyalty to the family biz by proposing to end the ban on offshore drilling allow unrestricted fracking abolish the Energy Department slash corporate taxes and block capandtrade . In a series of testy hearings Rep Darrell Issa grilled lawyers on what went to their best clerical error was their best answer to the wrong clerical answer to what went on their lawyers on their best . In 2007 a federal court challenged the government's ability to impose a de facto subsidy of 147 billion as much as 147 billion in federal court in Louisiana . The Justice Department has appealed the case slogs on
---  The expansion of Washington8217s national security state has historically met little opposition in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations . TomDispatch asks what lessons might be offered to such a Martian crashlanding in Washington as 2014 begins . The U.S. government is remarkably unchecked and unbalanced in the way of the political system, writes TomDispatch . He says reimagining what has developed in these last decades as a faithbased system as a new national religion would help explain the new Washington to that wayward Martian . The system's main global enemy consists of thousands of lightly armed jihadis and wannabe jihadis scattered mainly across the backlands of the planet . The NSS is at heart a proselytizing warrior religion It has its holy orders and its dogma and its warrior priests It has the sanctified promised land known as 8220the homeland8221 It is a monotheistic faith in that way of being an eye in the sky an all-seeing and all-powerful god is an apostate to anyone who cares to be forgiven by those who care to look at those in its holy order . The Devil is the system whose evil seed is known to breed on the planet from Sanaa to breed in Yemen and its holy seed .  The national security state has developed a faithbased system of secrecy in which the deepest mysteries have until recently been held by the smallest numbers of believers in which problems are adjudicated in a 8220court8221 system so secret that only favored arguments can be presented to its judges . NSS officials may8212and their religion permits this8212 lie to and manipulate the public Congress allies or anyone else and do so without compunction . They do this based on the belief that the deepest secrets of their world and how it operates can only truly be understood by those already inducted into their orders . Yet they are not simply manipulating us in service to their One True Faith Nothing is ever that simple before they manipulate us they must spend years manipulating themselves Only because they have already convinced themselves of the deeper truth of their mission do they accept the necessity of manipulating others in what still passes for a democracy . The militaryindustrial complex has also shown a striking ability to generate support for its evergrowing structure by turning itself into a lucrative global operation . The national defense budget is estimated to be larger than those next 13 countries combined combined to be . The U.S. defense system is also a gigantic fraud of a gigantic system that delivers its followers only because its followers never delivers
---  In 1997 400 AfricanAmerican farmers sued the United States Department of Agriculture alleging they had been unfairly denied USDA loans due to racial discrimination during the period 1983 to 1997 . The case was entitled Pigford vs Glickman and in 1999 the black farmers won their case The government agreed to pay each of them as much as 50000 to settle their claims . But then on February 23 2010 something shocking happened in relation to that original judgment In total silence the USDA agreed to release more funds to Pigford EET The amount was a staggering82308230 125 billion This was because the original number of plaintiffs had now swollen in a class action suit to include a total of 86000 black farmers throughout America There was only one teensy problem The United States of America doesn8217t have 86000 . According to accurate and totally verifiable Official USDA 2007 Census data the total number of black farmers in the US is only 39697 Hmmm8230 by the Official USDA 1992 Census Data the US had only 18816 black farmers . The original judgment in 1999 only applied to a . total of about 16000 black . farmers . But in 2008 a junior US Senator got a law passed to reopen the case and allow more black farmers to sue for funds The Senator was Barack Hussein Obama  A third of the claims in Pigford I were denied under Track A 8212 the 8216virtually automatic8217 cash payment CRSamp160went on to say many in Congress 8230 voiced much concern over the large percentage of denials . The rejection of tens of thousands of late claims triggered more lawsuits as well as congressional hearings and legislation It also triggered a lot of false and misleading information Pigford II The email is incorrect in saying that Obama got a law passed to reopen the case and allow more black farmers to sue . The email also incorrectly says there were 86000 fraudulent claims filed as a result of the 2008 law that permitted the late claims to go forward . It also wrongly says that this law was passed in dead silence and that the USDA agreed to release more funds to Pigford . The court has not yet approved the settlement and no awards have been paid to any PigfordII claimants said Justice Spokeswoman Jessica Smith. The email asks How on earth did 39697 explode into the fraudulent 86000 claims The CRS report provides some answers to the question . The report says Census data that it says showed there were only 18816 black farmers and 2007 Census data only counted only 39697 farmers . It is also likely that some of some of

---  51 of the electorate chose to keep Barack Obama in the White House . Some Republicans claim that demography is destiny which means the GOP is going the way of the Whigs and the Dodo .

The factions in the party that are not socially conservative see these looming threats as an opportunity to get the GOP to drop the social stuff .

---  Donald Trump has a plan to solve America8217s drug crisis kill the drug dealers . Donald Trump is a thoroughgoing hypocrite on practically every subject 8212 except human rights . US foreign policy used to be reliably twofaced Washington would regularly call out its adversaries on human rights abuses while largely ignoring the egregious violations of its closest friends . The president has extended the blind eye of American policy to just about everyone . The State Department has been issuing an exhaustive annual report on human human rights violators for half a century . The diminished impact of the State Department reflects the diminished state of the department itself . Expecting hardliner Mike Pompeo about to take over as secretary of state his department will prove even less of a speed bump in the president's dangerous game of chicken with the global community . The writing has been on the wall in big letters from the Trumpian era . In May the earliest moments of the Trump era In May, In May 2017 In May Trump told an official official in his first meeting with State Department staff that the US national interests interests a shot across the bows bows across the US bows that contributed to a wave of unfaffing it through unfinging it across the department bows. Expecting to be even more aggressive than  President Trump has made a point of establishing close working relationships with some of the worst autocrats on the planet . The world's greatest human rights abusers aren't on that list 8212 because many of them are among the president8217s . Trump recently eulogized the Chinese president for making himself ruler for life wistfully regretting that an unnamed American president couldn't do the same . In Trump's universe in other words human rights abuses are committed only by a handful of 8220bad hombres8221 The world’s greatest human right abusers aren’t on the list because of the president. In Trump’ universe the world”s greatest human rights abuses aren8217t on that list 8212 . The appointment of Mike Pompeo a wellknownamp160 Iranophobe can only strengthen amp160 and the appointment of a well known Iranophobe a wellknown Iranophile can only strengthen the relationship with the U.S. President Trump.

---  Presidential elections in Ukraine are set to be held on Sunday and it looks as if chocolate magnate or chocolate tycoon Petro Poroshenko who supported the Maidan protests is set to win . How will his presidency fundamentally differ from that of the former ousted president Yanukovych? Anton Woronczuk joins us to discuss this is Volodymyr Ishchenko . Ishchenko is a sociologist studying social protests in Ukraine He is Deputy Director of the Center for Social and Labor Research in Kiev an editor of Commons Journal for Social Criticism and lecturer in the National University of KyivMohyla Academy . Poroshenko is one of the hundred richest people in Ukraine and is well known for his confectionery production for his chocolates He is called chocolate king in Ukraine And yeah its quite true that hes the likeliest winner of the coming elections probably winhes able to win in the first round of elections probably winning in the coming election . Woronczuk says they have very little little like 13 percent to compete in the polls according to polls so they dont have any different chances in different polls so there are very little different to the other polls in the different polls in different countries. Poroshenko would be much more dependent on the support of other oligarchs  The leaders of the protest are definitely the proRussian separatists And these are the peoplemany of them are actually Russian citizens . Leaders of Donetsk Peoples Republic and Lugansk Peoples Republic they do really have Russian nationalist views . The majority in these regions do so see this uprising as legitimate and the uprising with legitimate claims And on the other hand yes there are some worker support but also thatsthere are some workers who are on the side of Kiev government And there are many actions actually by workers who do not support neither Kiev government nor Russian separatists WORONCZUK So lets shift the conversation to the political rebellion in the eastern regions of Ukraine like Donetsk like Donetsk Theres been several different accounts that Ive read that characterizes the protesters Some of these accounts include describing them as selforganized independent militias that have no particular affiliation or you know particular sympathy for Kiev or Moscow Other accounts describe them as proRussian militants who seek annexation from Russia but there are also many accounts that he can be just a simple volunteer volunteering for this cause to separate Donbas from Ukraine . But having to say this itsyou cannot reject that the separatist rebellion in Donbas has some mass base . And for example according to the last polls taken in conducted in the beginning of May 56 percent of
---  A week after the most powerful 8220super typhoon8221 ever recorded pummeled the Philippines killing thousands in a single province and three weeks after the northern Chinese city of Harbin suffered a devastating 8220 airpocalypse8221 suffocating the city with coalplant pollution . A wave of serial eruptions of this sort would not be without precedent In the early years of twentiethfirst century for example one government after another in disparate parts of the former Soviet Union was swept away in what were called the 8220 color revolutions82208212populist upheavals against authoritarian regimes . In 2011 a similar wave of protests erupted in North Africa culminating in what we call the Arab Spring . In fact it is possible to imagine such a green energy revolution erupting in one part of the world and spreading like wildfire to others in other places and it can be found around the globe . In all likelihood it will erupt spontaneously after a cascade of climate change induced disasters like airpocalypses and other disasters such as airpocalyptic airpohas and super typhoons are the type of disasters that scientists tell us will become a pervasive part of life on a planet being transformed by the massive consumption of carbonbased fuels like tar sands and shale gas .  The Ningbo protests highlight a growing governmental vulnerability to mass environmental protest . The Chinese government concluded that mass action of this sort occurring in the heart of a major city and featuring alliance of students farmers and young professionals was too great a threat to the government . After Fukushima two of the largest protests were sparked by the reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants on March 11 2011 after a massive tsunami struck northern Japan . The biggest protests occurred in Germany on March 26th 15 days after the Fukushima explosions an estimated 250000 people participated in antinuclear demonstrations across the country . Germany has now announced that the remaining 10 remaining nuclear power reactors will be phased out by 2022 almost 20 years earlier than in her original plan . The decision to phase out nuclear power almost two decades early will have significant repercussions for the German economy . Shutting down the reactors and replacing them with wind and solar energy will cost an estimated 735 billion and take several decades producing soaring electricity bills and periodic energy shortages and soaring energy bills and frequent energy shortages . The protests are just the prelude to a new strong antinnuclear movement8221 declared Jochen Stay a protest leader. Stay a . protest leader and has declared Jochen St. Stay is a leader .
---  Inauguration Day more than two weeks gone and already part of our distant past In its wake President Obama was hailed or reviled for his 8220liberal8221 second inaugural address . One subject at least got remarkably little attention during the inaugural blitz and when mentioned it struck few as odd or worth dwelling on Yet nothing better caught our changing American world Washington after all was in a lockdown mode unmatched by any inauguration from another era8212 Not even Lincoln8217s second inaugural in the midst of the Civil War or Franklin Roosevelt 8217s during World War II or FDR's at the height of the Cold War . The resulting United States of Fear has since engaged in two disastrous wars and a Global War on Terror shows no sign of ending ending in our lifetime See Mali or Yemen . It has also also funded the supersized that post911 funded the . supersized US Homeland Security and a labyrinthine intelligence bureaucracy that is now an everexpanding that post 9/11 forces expanding within the US military expanded into an elite cocooned cocooning within the secret military elite . In the meantime he8212and 911 as it entered the American psyche8212helped facilitate the locking down of this society in ways that should unnerve us all  The post911 National Security Complex has been convulsed by such fears since 911 . The fear of terrorism has funded itself by promising Americans one thing total safety from one of the lesser dangers of our American world82128221 terrorism8221 In the Bush era Dick Cheney was always driven around Washington with 8220a duffel bag stocked with a gas mask and a biochemical survival suit8221 in the backseat of his car . Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld changed our world as cultists of a unitary executive8221 they lifted the executive branch right out of the universe of American legality They liberated it to do more or less what it wished as long as 8220war8221 or 8220terrorism8221 could be invoked . They established or strengthened the power of the executive to torture at will and create the 8220legal8221 justification for it imprison at will indefinitely and without trial assassinate at will including American citizens kidnap at will . And transform whistleblowing whistleblowing into the only prosecutable crime that anyone in the Complex can commit It is now the only prosecutingable crime the lockdown state can commit . The Lockdown State is now fully in a postlegal world and never brought to court or have a chance of being put in jail .

Vijay is this years Edward Said Chair at American University at Beirut . His most recent book is The Poorer Nations A Possible History of the Global South . He says international law is in a very poor situation and its actually gotten worse in a sense since 2003 when the U.S. extended its war in Iraq . Obama administration enshrined through pressure on the UN this idea of responsibility to protect the R2P doctrine in the first term of the Obama administration . The International Criminal Criminal Court is used when its useful at the start of the Libya war against Mr. Saif Saif al-Gaddafi is framed against Saif Seni al-Ghaddafi . He also says there is no separation of powers against the International Criminal Court against the Libyan war against Seni Seni Saif Al-Gadhadh . He argues that there is not only the executive and judiciary but also the US and European allies have taken the responsibility to become the . International Criminal  NATO acted in Libya following a UN resolution and constantly reiterated the fact that we are just operating under the terms of UN Resolution 1973 . When the UN then asked for an investigation of civilian casualty deaths as a result of NATOs bombing NATO sent a letter to the UN saying we have conducted our own investigation we have not committed any war crimes or any crimes so we dont need to share anything with you JAY PRASHAD says the international community has an obligation to act in the way as international law enjoins . The African Union has been deliberately starved and sidelined and sidelined by the U.S. The international community is now saying it should have been writing in Benghazi what a genocide in Benghazi is what NATO should have written in their resolution is NATO should actually have written their resolution in Benghazi . The UN says all member states must act to prevent genocide in their Benghazi what they should prevent in Benghazi in the Benghazi genocide in what they have done in their own resolution is what the UN has done in Benghazi and what is a mistake is what youre going to do in the case to go by mistake JAY . The U.N. Security Council has been the driving force in undermining international law for their own I think very narrow nationalist interest Russia is just saying
---  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made some missteps in the March 9 debate in Miami . Clinton claimed that in 2006 Sanders 8220stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous absurd efforts to quote 8216hunt down immigrants8217 8221 Sanders vehemently objected saying he did 8220not support vigilantes and that Clinton8217s accusation was 8220horrific8221 and 8220unfair8221 Sanders accused Clinton of unfairly cherrypicking 8220pieces8221 out of larger bills to distort his record But in this case Sanders voted in favor of a standalone amendment proposed by Minutemanfriendly Republicans Sanders argued that the legislation merely codified existing policy but it was opposed by a majority of Democrats . The amendment passed 293107 It was supported nearly unanimously by Republicans and while a sizable number of Democrats opposed it . Sanders at the time a member of the House but he voted for it Sanders was a House but ultimately was not included in the DHS bill passed by the DHS . Clinton said it was a meaningless thing and Sanders and Sabo said it is not a meaningful thing and that it was just a nuisance amendments all the time . Clinton and Sanders said it would not be included in a DHS bill that would not have been included in an amendment .  Clinton was responding to a question regarding difficulty of passing environmental legislation in Congress . Clinton cited executive powers to regulate pollution 8212 singling out the Clean Power Plan which the EPA proposed in June 2014 to cut carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 . The League of Conservation Voters notes in its review of the presidential candidates8217 positions on the plan . Sanders has voted against attempts to block attempts to implement the plan and a separate EPA regulation of new power plants . Clinton said in a radio interview that there is a difference between migrant children and refugee children who are treated differently under the law . She also said that allowing all of the children to stay would encourage more children to make that dangerous journey8221 to the US . We asked the Sanders campaign for a response to the criticism that his plan could cause a delay in implementing the CPP but we did not get a response from a response . We looked at Clinton8217s remarks before when the same attack line was used against her by former Maryland Gov Martin O8217Malley who has since ended his presidential campaign campaign . We are by these are poor children across our border and they are by poor children and by these children across the border . We have a point of view

---  Part two of our discussion of the state of American democracy and the rise of corporate capitalism inverted totalitarianism with Professor Sheldon Wolin . Professor Wolin: Corporate capital really make war against participatory democracy democratic institutions . Chris Hedges: The New Deal and liberal resurgence also would cause the reaction that led to the reaction to a kind of reaction that would lead to a permanent realization of conservative that it had to develop a permanent conservative force in American politics from the ground . Wolin says that the early 30s was not only a period of New Deal ferment it was also period of reactionary ferment that one must be a defender of the Liberty League and above all Father Coughlin was someone who had become so disowned by his own church and had to be at least throttledby his own own church he had to wait for elections but to become a permanent force of conservative force . The Christian Right and the War on America started up because it started up in those years because of the ground where you would say that would be the kind of conservative forces that started up that would not wait for the elections but would not just wait for those elections but instead of wait for that election but would just wait to go for elections . The New York Times won the Pulitzer Prize-winning  The failure of governments in America to be able to capture and mobilize and sustain popular support while introducing structural economic and social changes that would meet the needs of a large urban and industrialized population I think that was the failure . Europe was clearly heading toward some uncertain future with Hitler and Mussolini and then the specter of Stalin so that it was a very worrisome nervous period that had a lot to be nervous about . Young people in a certain sense who are the sort of later political movements and political support systems that are propelled and propelled in a very real way . I think a strong element in it still remains in it but I think theres potential in movements towards selfgovernment movements towards economic independence and movements towards educational reform and so on that have the seeds for change . But I think there are still a lot of people still feel that they have a right to agitate and agitate to promote agitate out of the vitality out there . I don't know where to go and sort of where are being propelled and go, propelled and sort to go, and I think I dont know where do you go and what I think of where do we go and where do do you know where we go, where we are going and what do we want to go?

---  Senate Intelligence Committee report on secret CIA drone wars and other American air campaigns in the 18yearlong war on terror was finally released . The 500page executive summary of the report was released on December 6 2019 three years into a sagging Clinton presidency and a bitterly divided Congress . Ron Wyden DOR took to the Senate floor amid the warnings of his Republican colleagues that its release might 8220 inflame8221 America8217s enemies leading to violence across the Greater Middle East and said 8220 was a stain on our values and on our history8221 Though it was a Friday afternoon normally a dead zone for media attention the response was instant and stunning . There were the unexpected internal Agency discussions of the imprecision of the robotic weapons always publicly hailed as 8220surgically precise8221 and also of the weakness of much of the intelligence that led them to their targets and of the targeting of groups of young men of military age about whom nothing specifically was known and of course there was the raging argument that ensued in the media over the 8220revelations8221 of it all . The report became a 247 media event as had happened five years earlier with the committee 8217s similarly foughtover report on torture it became a media event  Former CIA Director Leon Panetta repeated his classic statement of 2009 insisting to a range of media interviewers that the drone campaign was not just 8220effective8221 but still 8220the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the alQaeda leadership . Former President Barack Obama did an interview with NBC News from his new presidential library still under construction in Chicago saying in part 8220We assassinated some folks but those who did so were American patriots working in a time of great stress and fear . Former Vice President Dick Cheney insisted that the new Senate report like the old one was a 8220gob of unpatriotic hooey8221 And President Hillary Clinton did not however go on to admit that the still ongoing drone program or even the wedding air strikes were 8220mistakes8221 On December 11th as everyone knows the mass junior high school shootings in Wisconsin occurred and media attention shifted there 247 On December 13th Reuters reported that a drone attack in Pakistan8217s tribal borderlands which was 8220suspected killed seven 8220militants including two children and a 70yearold elder had been among the dead8212 local residents . The US has been making up the future rules of the road for the rest of the world

Or his fellows at the CIA who were clearly involved in waterboarding if he is head of the CIA said well its torture the employees under him are then guilty of torture . Brennan is really saying that drone and torture policy is really part of a US quote global war on terror right now now now JAY Now the Senate committee talked about the report which was done which was an executive summary of 300 pages which Brennan said he was shocked to read and apparently it was the story of the use of torture by the CIA and how they had been used by the Senate . Brennan said it was a story of torture and how the CIA had apparently had to read it and apparently had in the story we had been told to bear down on this parcel right now.

---  UN Security Council resolution 2375 passed on September 11 was 8220watered down8221 so as to obtain Chinese and Russian agreement . Western media give the impression that the resolution as passed is mild or mainly symbolic Nothing could be further from the truth . The sanctions are an expression of pure malevolence and are hitting every citizen of North Korea to further the US goal of geopolitical domination of the AsiaPacific . There is no principle at stake here for the U.S. and there is something unseemly that the United States with the long record in recent years of invading and overthrowing other nations accuses North Korea of threatening to overthrow its long record . North Korea has been at peace for several decades of being an international threat of international peace, observes the fate of Iraq and Libya . The United States does not stop with UN sanctions on the North Korean people does not cease with a spectacular scale with the sanctions, says Roy Roy Royce Royce . The UN Foreign Affairs Committee chairman of Foreign Affairs Ed Royce. It is not absurd that the US has not been able to stop with sanctions on North Korea on a spectacularscale with its long history of overthrowing overthrowing and invading other nations accusing North Korea . The U.N. Korea of being able to  U.S. is preparing sanctions against foreign banks and companies that do business with North Korea . US officials are fanning out across the globe seeking to cajole or threaten other nations to join the antiDPRK crusade . China has implemented steps in the financial realm that exceed what is called for by UN Security Council resolutions . US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently insisted that China impose a total oil embargo on North Korea. China refused to go along but it can expect be subjected to mounting pressure from the US in the weeks ahead . Several nations are currently under investigation by the United Nations for trade with N. Korea . Several African nations have warm relations with the DPRK dating back to the period of the continent of the DPRK . The demand to cut relations with North Korean is not an easy sell for Washington for the U.N. and many African nations are not easy to sell for the US for their regimes while the DPRK had supported African liberation regimes . The demands never cease no matter how much China gives way no matter the US gives way . Washington is running an international protection racket give us what we demand or we will hurt you, says Tulohiameni Kalomeni Kalohomeni Tulohomomeni says an official in Namibia .
---  The destabilization of what in the Bush years used to be called 8220the arc of instability8221 It involves at least 97 countries across the bulk of the global south much of it coinciding with the oil heartlands of the planet . Washington is militarily involved overtly or covertly in outright war or what passes for peace . The Pentagon and US intelligence services are also running covert special forces and spy operations launching drone attacks . The United States is now involved now involved in wars in six arcofinstability nations Afghanistan Iraq Libya Pakistan and Yemen and Somalia . The odds are that there is no longer a single nation in that arc in which the U.S. is in no way militarily involved amp160 Tom Bracken says . Obama has overseen the deployment of greater numbers of special operations forces to the region has transferred or brokered the sale of substantial quantities of weapons there while continuing to build and expand military bases at a torrid rate as well as training and supplying local security forces . The CIA is reportedly building a secret base for the region while the CIA is building somewhere in the region for its secret bases . The U.N. is building secret prisons in other secret bases for secret operations operations . The US has reportedly building secret  The US has personnel8212some in token numbers some in more sizeable contingents8212deployed in 76 other nations sometimes counted in the arc of instability . Pentagon documents released earlier this year revealed that the US is conducting covert operations on the IranIraq border and a coming CIA campaign of covert operations aimed at halting the smuggling of Iranian arms into Iraq . The Obama administration and the US military have largely avoided using the phrase 8220arc of instability8221 preferring to refer to it using far vaguer formulations . The majority of white Western nations have never been American targets . Washington has wielded military aid military actions and diplomatic pressure in the way as Pakistan promotes factional instability to undermine its government of factionalism within its intelligence services and stoke anti-American sentiment to a remarkable 12 percent . According to a recent survey just 12 percent of Pakistanis have a positive view of the United States Aisecret drone war . In Yemen, 97 percent of respondents have a favorable view of a positive reaction to a U.S. drone war figure in a survey of the US drone war. In Yemen it is almost impossible to achieve any sort of weapons training and military aid to achieve a sort of sort of military assistance. In Pakistanis. It comes to

Dr Heiner is a professor of economics at the University of Hamburg . He served as director of the Division on Globalization and Development Strategies of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development known as UNCTAD . Heiner says the financial crisis was not inevitable nor is the looming crisis of the real economy both are manmade Both are consequences direct and indirect of a flawed economic doctrine that has seen arrival over the past 30 years Heiner: We misunderstand today how a market economy has to be run and we misunderstand the role of policies and how a . market economy must be run. We have clear evidence that for example you have the commodity markets driven by financial action by financial market participants who in a herding way drive the prices up systematically driving prices up . And we have a systemic misfunctioning mis-function of the . markets, he says. We need a revival for a revival of a sound consumption revival. And we need a sound recovery. And the government has to call it to be called in the market economy. And it has to act for a sound .  Financial markets are the most important markets in the whole economy and if they are not working well then you cannot expect their economic policy to achieve what they want to achieve Look at monetary policy Monetary policy is the best example . The government has to step in and stimulate real investment in fixed capital in infrastructure in education or education . The biggest stimulus in all times that we have in the last years in the U.S. in Japan in Europe now it doesnt work It is not permeate through the economy . The domestic market is in danger of collapsing and this hurt these people as well as the people who have rather high unemployment with high unemployment in the end they cannot succeed with a flourishing economy . But they need a domestic market In the end, I understand. Even worse I have to insist its even worse than fraud or anecdotal or single misbehavior of a certain person even worse. even worse I Have to insist it is even worse for people in the middle of the economic system to try and find the right channel to get people to invest in long-term investment in the long term and to make money in the domestic market I understand what you need to understand. The government can only make money with that with that they like the rather unemployment with rather high Unemployment with that

---  Jonathan Schell died of cancer on Tuesday at their home in New York City . Schell was a writer and journalist Peace and Disarmament Correspondent for The Nation magazine . He was a staff writer at The New Yorker magazine from 1967 to 1987 . He condemned conflicts from Vietnam to Iraq and warned of a nuclear holocaust in terrifying detail in his prizewinning book The Fate of the Earth nominated for a Pulitzer Prize . We will do everything possible to keep his life long mission for peace and disarmament a central part of TRNN coverage Jonathan joined the board of The Real News Network in 2005 he was at our very first board meeting smiling ear to ear Since that day he never missed an opportunity to stress the importance of our work As a journalist and antiwar activist he condemned conflicts . The Nation Institute teaches a course on the nuclear dilemma at the Yale Law School and a visiting lecturer at the Nation Institute . He is equally equally equally well known for his work with The Nation Magazine and The New York State Department of State Department Of New York. He was also a member of the National Security Council of the United States of New York’s Council of Chiefs of Defense Council of Defense Department of Defense of Defense Of Defense of the Defense Of the Defense .  There is a war going on against Iran and an economic war of very serious sanctions that is causing a lot of hardship for ordinary Iranians SCHELL And then on top of that we have an incredibly serious military departure really in Iran really this week we had major explosions in electrical plants that really feed the nuclear plants in Iran . President Obama as yet never gets asked by the mainstream media and certainly how youre that is that he is not involved with the use of cyberwar and that is actually upset the centrifuges in Iran and the centrifugees in nuclear plants that are in the nuclear facilities in Iran that we can expect full-scale attacks on other countries to get into the full line of line of work as well as that line of that . But the Real News is not just the United States just as well and certainly that is how it works with the full-line of work that is done by the media and it is a full-time and that it is something that is never asked by mainstream media. We can expect other countries that are involved with full-level military warfare. We have an incredible level of consequence for the future because of what we expect. We are not just asking by the full lines of work. They were going to do something thered
---  Shir Hever is an economist working at The Real News Network . His economic research focuses on Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territory . His first book Political Economy of Israels Occupation Repression Repression Beyond Exploitation was published by Pluto Press . Shir is a political economist working in Germany . Paul Jay in Baltimore joins us to discuss Israeli strategic thinking in all of this . Shir: Israel is mostly concerned about its domestic politics and the Arab peace initiative is a very reasonable offer Israel has no intentions of accepting it. If this sort of pressure continues Israel will be exposed as unwilling to work with the United States and unwilling to negotiate with the Palestinians, says Shir . Hever: The Israeli government is in a tight position at the moment because John Kerry secretary of state for the US had some visits to the region tried to restart the peace negotiations. It could change of course if the regime in Syria will change. This could change  if the situation in Syria would change. But remember that there is no peace between the countries both Hafez alAssad and Bashar alAssad have generally kept the ceasefire in place and havent tried to provoke any kind of action against Israel. Although there is a shift and hes almost almost possible almost almost becoming a possible almost cynical view  Israel is in a state of crisis a longterm crisis mainly because conscription rates are dropping because the soldiers are not willing to risk their lives as before . Israel is more dependent on military companies on the military technology on their ability to use unmanned drones and sophisticated missile systems and so on Chuck Hagel decided to accept this report . Hagel: Israel has so far never attacked Iran directly only very indirectly through some complicated cyber means . Israel has not launched a massive invasion against Lebanon since 2006 and instead focused most of its violence against Gaza the Gaza Strip . If Hezbollah will have the ability to intentionally target sensitive areas inside Israel then maybe Israel will just not have the option of attacking Lebanon anymore thats something I dont think the Israeli government is willing to forego JAY But if he can show that he made the US make such a move that he forced Obamas hand that would make him seem like a hero of Israels security, Hagel says . Israel cannot actually do anything to withhold the consequences of that attack might further destabilize the region, he says. If Israel cannot withhold consequences of the consequences, it might even withhold anything to even withhold consequences from that attack, he asks. Israel can act freely and the US cannot actually withhold any consequences .

Trump's policies would increase the debt by 115 trillion over 10 years, according to a June 27 report by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget . Pence revived an old chestnut from the 2012 presidential campaign saying that we cannot have four more years of apologizing to our enemies . Trump in fact would make our debt dramatically worse8221 to the debt .

---  Inauguration Day more than two weeks gone and already part of our distant past . President Obama was hailed and reviled for his second inaugural address . Obama took pains not to bring up the budget deficit . Osama bin Laden tax including that 120 million dollars for Inaugural Day has proved heavy in the American psyche . The resulting resulting U.S. society of Fear has since engaged in two disastrous wars and a disastrous war on Terror820Global War on War on Terror on the planet . Tom Engelhardt: It's time to face the facts this isn't your grandfather8217t your grandfather. This time around a new world8217s landed on us making fantasy into reality. We need to accept the reality of the new world we find ourselves in. We have to face it. We are not a giant empire but scattered jihadis and jihadis in distant and scattered minority insurgencies in distant lands that make up the post-911 Complex in the distant lands in distant regions. We must not ignore the enemy at hand at hand. It has no sign of ending in our lifetime ending in Pakistan or Mali or Yemen. It is not our grandfather. We don't have a chance of doing him in Afghanistan or Pakistan or Pakistan. We will not  The post911 National Security Complex has been convulsed by such fears . The fear of terrorism essentially that bin Laden tax again has been a financial winner for the Complex but it carries its own builtin terrors . Even with the 75 billion or more a year that we pump into the 8220 US Intelligence Community the possibility that it might not discover some bizarre plot leaves many in the Complex in an ongoing state of terror . The Powers of the Lockdown State as cultists of a 8220 unitary executive8221 they lifted the executive branch right out of the universe of American legality . They liberated it to do more or less what it wished as long as 8220war8221 or 8220terrorism8221 could be invoked . They established or strengthened the power of the executive to torture at will and create the justification for it imprison at will indefinitely and without trial assassinate at will including American citizens kidnap at will .

---  More than 58,000 Americans were killed along with more than four million Vietnamese Laotians and Cambodians during the Vietnam War . The Vietnam War is the signature catastrophe of the 1960s and Vietnam is the most controversial of all U.S. wars . Vietnam has few cultural markers or landmarks which shouldn't be surprising even Hollywood has stopped making Vietnam movies long ago . Most of the 180 students who take my Vietnam War class each year arrive deeply curious and are shocked by the details of the My Lai massacre in which American ground troops killed at close range more than 500 unarmed unresisting South Vietnamese civilians . The 1960s8212that extraordinary decade8212is celebrating its 50th birthday one year at a time Happy birthday 1965, TomDispatch writes . In 1971 the public told the public that the public had already found an appealing formula for commemorating the war and Americans had already turned ahead ahead of the decade and turned it into an unmitigated disaster. Jump ahead of a decade and found an appeal for an unapologetic war. In 1971 for a remarkable un-apologetic response to the war was an unmissed disaster. It turned it around a remarkable 58-year-old and turned the war into an appealing and unmissable disaster.  The Antiwar Movement Dispatched to the Trash Bin of History . Americans most saddled with blame for abusing Vietnam veterans were the antiwar activists of the previous era . Americans began to treat those who served the country as heroic by definition no matter what they had actually done This phenomenon first appeared in another context entirely in early 1981 when American diplomats and other personnel were finally released from 444 days of captivity in Iran the former hostages were given a hero8217s welcome for the ages . Since the attacks of 911 ritualized support for troops and veterans more symbolic than substantive has grown ever more common replete with yellow ribbons . The noble vet vet as reductive as the crazy vet and repeated empty gestures of gratitude foreclose the possibility of a real and real debate and debate .

---  Energy analysts had been anticipating an imminent decline in global oil supplies . For the first time in generations we are able to see that our energy supply is no longer limited in limited and finite . The speed and magnitude of this shift in thinking has been little short of astonishing . The expected boost in energy is predicted to provide the United States with a cornucopia of economic and political rewards including industrial expansion at home and enhanced geopolitical clout abroad . President Obama and Wall Street investors have already become infected with this euphoria as have top Wall St. investors . This movement from gloom about our energy future to what can only be called fossilfuel euphoria may prove to be the hallmark of our peculiar moment, writes TomDispatch . The country exulted Karen Moreau of the New York State Petroleum Council another industry cheerleader is now in a position 8220to become a global superpower on energy8221 . Moreau declared last February last February that there is a new reality of vast domestic resources of oil and natural gas resources in the U.S. and energy resources in a matter of a few years have reversed the trends have reversed in recent years . The Ed Ed Ed. Edmonds says, "There is a lot of extraordinary consequences of this extraordinary supply and demand  Bigmoney investors are rushing to take advantage of the current boom in unconventional energy output in the US8212the climate be damned . The new energy euphoria is fueling a growing sense that the American superpower may soon acquire fresh geopolitical clout through its mastery of the latest energy technologies . A stance of what could be called petro machismo is growing in Washington underlying such initiatives as the president8217s widely ballyhooed policy announcement of a 8220 pivot from the Middle East to Asia still largely words backed by only the most modest of actions and efforts to constrain Russia . There is no doubt that the fossil fuel euphoria will lead in troubling predictions of energy output are in the long run in troubling directions even if the rosy predictions of the present present present directions are likely to prove both unreliable and unrealistic . Fossil fuel reserves are vast especially when when the world makes several interconnected types of types of kinds of types make claims . The world will continue to supply an enormous share of global energy requirements for the foreseeable future given rising temperatures with rising temperatures packed with growing challenges and growing challenges with growing global challenges . Fossils will be packed and packed with other types of global challenges with the growing public opposition packed with these types of challenges and challenges .
---  Since 2000 stateappointed emergency managers in Detroit Highland Park Flint and Pontiac have outsourced key functions of their water departments to private companies while ramping up water shutoffs on lowincome households . Since 2013 when Republican governor Rick Snyder placed Detroit under an emergency manager the Detroit Water and Sewage Department has shut off water for over one hundred thousand residents . Public health experts have also said that the mass shutoffs will increase infectious disease and infant mortality in Detroit . Meanwhile even after its leadcontaminated water became a national scandal Flint has continued to shut off residents unable or unwilling to pay for poisoned water . The long history of housing discrimination in Flint and the racist application of emergency manager laws help explain why the majority of the poisoning victims are African American although they include many workingclass whites . Michigan8217s water crisis is rooted in the hollowing out of the public sector over the past three decades which emergency managers have accelerated . The water crisis in Michigan is also intertwined with the subprime mortgage meltdown which is closely related to the financial deregulation of sub-prime mortgage mortgage meltdown in the U.S. In 2005 Detroit had the highest rate of subprime mortgages in the United States . In 2008 Detroit was aggressively aggressively marketing and aggressively aggressively marketed to subprime .  In 2012 52 percent of Michigan voters and 82 percent of Detroit voters struck down Public Act 4 which expanded the authority of emergency managers to unilaterally break publicsector union contracts and lock elected officials out of city hall and council chambers and freeze email accounts . The primary purpose of Michigan8217s emergency manager legislation drafted with help from the Mackinac Center a think tank funded by Dick Devos the Walton Family the Koch brothers and other rightwing billionaires is to break public sector unions . In March 2013 Governor Snyder appointed Kevyn Orr as emergency manager for Detroit Orr a bankruptcy lawyer from Jones Day the largest corporate law firm in the United States placed bids to privatize DWSD the Detroit Public Lighting Department and waste collection at Detroit Public Works Department while leasing Belle Isle the largest cityowned island park in the U.S. to the state of Michigan for thirty years . The shutoffs spiked dramatically under the rule of Emergency Manager Orr from March 2013 through December 2014 . In a city where nearly 40 percent of the residents fall below the federal poverty line increasing water rates are a formula for default increasing water shutoffs are for default . In February 2014 the DWSD customer service department announced that 8220DWSD is preparing to rampup shutoffs . The Detroit Future City plan

---  Congressional Apportionment Reform An Idea Whose Time Has Come A Legislative Response to Citizens United by Robert Mark . The decennial US Census has been used since 1790 as the basis for the United States representational form of government . The number of districts apportioned to each state is defined by Congress in accordance with Title 2 of US Code . The Supreme Court ruled in a series of cases that congressional and state legislative districts must consist of relatively equal populations . The current size of Congress is 435 or one MC for each 709980 residents not exactly the proportional representation the founders had in mind in limiting the size of districts to no less than 30000 residents . This amendment was proposed as a means to ensure a minimum representation for the new U.S. government defined by the First Congress amendments properly addressing addressing issue were produced by the Senate and the Senate each issue were properly addressed by the drafters . According to the original intention the bolded amendment the bold and more should have been more and less should be more and the bolder and more . Under the intent of the framers of the original amendment would have prevented the problems created by the scriveners of Congress to adopt the boldest and more than the bold text as it was approved .  No particular apportionment method was used during the period 1850 to 1890 but from 1890 through 1910 the increasing membership of the House was calculated in such a way as to ensure that no state lost a seat due to shifts in population . In 1881 a provision for equally populated contiguous and compact singlemember districts was added to the reapportionment law . In 1911 the Apportionment Act of 1911 Public Law 625 raised the size of the US House to 433 with a provision to add one permanent seat each upon the admissions of Arizona and New Mexico as states . The law did not actually cap the number of districts it just set the number based on the 1910 census But it effectively limited the number districts for 20 years . For the first and only time Congress failed to pass an apportionments act after the 1920 census in the . 1920 census was the failure of the Congress to reapportion in 1920 and the desire to cut representation to immigrant and rural to urban black and southern migrants . The Reapportionment act of 1929 established a method for reallocating seats among the states given population shifts and continuing the maximum of 435 representatives at 435 in effect set in place until the 1930 census . Since 1961 there has been no been no mention of districts at all of the

---  Vietnam it8217s always there Looming in the past informing American futures . A 50-year-old war once labeled the longest in our history is still alive and well and still being refought by one group of Americans the military high command . A majority of historians known in academia as the 8220orthodox8221 school subscribe to the basic contours of the above narrative but the vast majority of senior U.S. military officers do not . The result of the Vietnam War has been an e-expanding war on terror from South Asia to Africa to the West Africa . The Big ReWrite is essentially turned out to be perpetual warfare based on perpetual war based on the perpetual war on perpetual terror . The GoBig Option was the US Army and the leading voice of the Clausewitzian School of Clausewitz and the U. Korean War and the GoVietnam War of the American War of Vietnam War of Cold War of War of The Cold War War of Iraq and the Cold War. The Big War of America is now a perpetual war of perpetual war. It is now the war of America. It has been a perpetual campaign of perpetual warfare. It will be a perpetual warfare of the US military. It can now be an eternal war.  A more sophisticated Clausewitzian analysis came from current national security adviser HR McMaster in a highly acclaimed 1997 book Dereliction of Duty . He argued that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were derelict in failing to give President Lyndon Johnson an honest appraisal of what it would take to win . Another Vietnam veteran retired Lt Col Andrew Krepinevich argued in 1986 that the NLF not the North Vietnamese Army was the enemy8217s chief center of gravity . In 1999 retired army officer and Vietnam veteran Lewis Sorley penned the definitive heartsandminds tract A Better War The Unexamined Victories and Final Tragedy of America 8217s Last Years in Vietnam . Sorley boldly asserted that by the spring of 1970 8220the fighting wasn8217t over but the war was won . By 2005 just as the situation in Iraq a country then locked in a sectarian civil war amid an American occupation went from bad to worse Sorley’s book found its way into the hands of the head of US Central Command Gen John Abizaid and State Department counselor Philip Zelikow . By then it could also be found on the bookshelves of senior military officers in Baghdad . It could also 8220be found on a bookshelf of senior . military
---  In 2016 the nuclear issue is back big time thanks to the rise of Donald Trump including unsettling comments he8217s made about nuclear weapons and actual changes in the global nuclear landscape . Not so long ago it was implausible that a major nuclear power 8212 the United States Russia or China 8212 would consider using atomic weapons in any imaginable conflict scenario . The next president will face a world in which a nuclear decisionmaking point might arrive far sooner than anyone would have thought possible just a year or two ago . The major nuclear powers and some smaller ones are all in the process of acquiring new nuclear arms which could in theory push that threshold lower still . This is likely to be our reality for years to come which means that the next president must decide whether the US should actually produce weapons of this type and also what measures should be taken in response to similar decisions by Washington 8217s to follow suit to other nuclear arms of its likely adversaries . The concept of mutually assured destruction in one of the most classically aptyms in all times of all times is being pushed dangerously lower still by the major nuclear nations . The U.S. and other nations are all likely to contain atomic warfare at such a devastating but still subapocalyptic level of warfare .  Russia has adopted a military doctrine that favors the early use of nuclear weapons if it faces defeat in a conventional war and NATO is considering similar measures in response . The nuclear threshold in other words is dropping rapidly due to Russian fears about its military inferiority vis224vis the West . Russia has been bolstering its defenses in areas bordering Ukraine and the Baltic states and training its troops for a possible clash with NATO forces stationed there . NATO strategists have discussed lowering the nuclear threshold themselves arguing 8212 that the Russians will only be fully dissuaded from employing their limitednuclearwar strategy if they know that NATO has a robust capacity to do the same . Both countries are already in the midst of extremely ambitious and costly efforts to develop and deploying new nuclear weapons . Both Washington and Moscow seem remarkably intent on developing and deploying nuclear weapons and are extremely ambitious efforts to upgrade their costly and costly arsenals . Both sides seem remarkably determined to keep their efforts to accommodate their efforts to become more pronounced in the years ahead ahead of the next years ahead of a nuclear escalation . This is a recipe for an apocalyptic and disaster of course for a future military escalation of course which is almost unimaginable and unimaginable escalation of the years to become an apocalyptic disaster of

Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace promoted his August 23 interview with Towey on the August 23 edition of Fox News . The book is a book that is being used by the Veterans Administration and is being .  Wallace falsely claimed that more than a month ago VA health practitioners were told to refer all veterans not just endoflife veterans but all 24 million veterans to this document Your Life Your Choices . Wallace claimed that President Bush suspended the use of the document in 2007 and that the Obama administration reinstated it . Wallace also claimed that the document directs all veterans to refer to it . Towey misrepresented passage that says If Im a vegetable pull the plug can mean different things to different people Wallace Towey falsely claimed Bush suspended purported death book use during the interview Towey claimed that Bush administration pulled the document from use in 2007 . In reality Bushs VA promoted the document throughout his presidency as documented by Daily Kos blogger Jed Lewison . Wallace said it requires VAs physicians atAs to refer their patients to This document at least at least their patients . Wallace was referring patients to Your Life your Choices or other published resources . Wallace: The death book is doomed doomed and Obama will pull the thing because its the right thing to do and because its a political nobrainer. Wallace also said it has been trying to sell a massive new health care plan that has been in use of this document. In fact as Media Matters documented the document to which Wallace was refer patients to
---  The Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq was what novelists refer to as 8220the precipitating event8221 the thing that may not actively cause every plot twist to come but that certainly sets them in motion . The forces loosed there in 2003 have yet to reach their natural end point . Iraq is now the saddest part of the tale the forces loose there in Iraq in 2003 are yet to be felt cleaving from the full of the gates of Baghdad . Iraq in the words of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is the 8220 worst foreign policy blunder8221 in American history . America8217s 2003 invasion resulted in the rise of Sunni insurgents and an influx of determined foreign fighters rushed into the vacuum . Iran is now a common foe of the US but the Sun is a common ally against what Washington pretends to what Washington is a Sun and the Iranians are a common enemy but the Iranians see their common foe in Baghdad but the U.S. is their common enemy. Iraq is a quagmire. If there is any unifying authority in Iraq it is expected to be a civil war inside the initial civil war. At some point expect civil war in Iraq. Expect there to be an unifying power inside a civil civil war .  American invasion of 2003 opened the way for the Kurds to form a virtual independent statelet a confederacy if you will even if still confined within Iraq8217s borders . The Kurds responded by fighting well at least in what they considered the Kurdish part of Iraq However their interest in getting involved in the greater SunniShia civil war was minimal In a good turn for them the US military helped Kurdish forces move into northern Syria right along the Turkish border . In August 2015 the Turks agreed to allow the Americans to fly strike missions from two air bases in Turkey against ISIS in Syria However there appeared to be an unpublicized quid pro quo the US would turn a blind eye to Turkish military action against its allies the Kurds . In June of this year Turkish President Recep Erdogan went as far as to say that he would 8220never allow the establishment of a Kurdish state in northern Syria8221 In light of all that it was hardly surprising that early Obama administration efforts to draw Turkey into the fight against ISIS were unsuccessful Things changed in August 2015 when a supposedly antiISIS cooperation deal was reached with Washington . In the process the Kurds found themselves supported by the US in the struggle with ISIS even as they were being thrown to the Turkish wolves . In September the Kurds
---  Three decades from now most Americans will have only the haziest idea why the US is meddling in Afghanistan . The US put boots on the ground in 2001 and now 12 years later is still fighting there against some Afghans on behalf of other Afghans while training Afghan troops to take over and fight their countrymen and others on their own . President Bush seemed puzzled by the CIA man8217s question about the war in Afghanistan to President George HW Bush in 1991 . Bush reportedly asked 8220Is that thing still going on8221 such forgetfulness about wars has it seems become an allAmerican skill . Seven billion dollars worth of equipment is now being torn up chopped down, split shredded stomped and when possible sold off for scrap at pennies a pound . Taxpayers may one day want to ask about such profligate questions about some of the historic waste of their waste and use some of it all to follow them and follow them in their own way to follow it in the annals of this effort . The centerpiece of this demolition derby may be the brand new 64,000-square 34,000 square foot stateoft stateoft of Helmand Province command center built as a new state of art in Helmand province just as most troops left and now most US troops left .  Afghans who remain at home are on edge ahead of the presidential election scheduled for April 5 2014 . Number of Afghans filing applications for asylum in other countries rising sharply since 2010 reached 30000 in 2012 . Undocumented thousands flee the country illegally in all sorts of dangerous ways . Afghan boat people who roused the antiimmigrant rhetoric of candidates in the recent Australian elections revealing a dark side of the national character even as Afghans and others drowned off their shores . President Hamid Karzai constitutionally barred from a third term the presidential race is either wide open or8212as many believe8212already a done deal In August Afghan news services reported that Karzai had chaired a meeting with a few of the country8217s most powerful warlords to call for the candidacy of Abdul Rab Rasoul Sayyaf, longtime pal of Osama bin Laden mentor of alQaeda . Karzai has also been tampering with the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission AIHRC nominee Dr Samar Samar Samar and the most respected public body in the country . Meanwhile Karzai cut loose an assery researcher of war crimes for a researcher of  Ahmad Nader Nad Nadar Nadar . Nadar was cut loose and cut loose in the loose research researcher of a researcher for a study of the .
---  The dollar8217s drop to threeyear lows this week after prolonged weakness in 2017 is expected to further boost profits at big US companies . The dollar has fallen on expectations central banks besides the Federal Reserve are seeking to end their policy of ultralow even negative rates adopted to combat the 2008 global financial crisis . US multinationals especially energy and technology companies that have a significant portion of their sales overseas could benefit the most from the currency effect while other sectors like telecommunications benefit less . Investors are keeping an eye out for signs of the dollars impact on company earnings as fourth quarter reporting ramps up next week . The effects may not be as headline grabbing as those from the changes to the US tax law that were enacted last month by US Congress and President Donald Trump . Changes to the law which are prompting many companies to take onetime charges in fourthquarter reports include a cut in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent . The expected boon to earnings has helped stocks rally so far this year while the weak dollar has added to the enthusiasm of the enthusiasm for corporate tax cuts . Investors still face considerable riskampers though they suggest investors still face enormous risk of investors still facing considerable risk . The technical vulnerabilities of the market . The charts reflect the technical vulnerabilities  Five of the six largest capitalized stocks in the SampampP 500 is down close to 12 percent over the past four calendar weeks and on track for the worst such decline in its sixyear history . Tech titans account for more than 33 trillion in market capitalization or more than 14 percent of the market's total value . Despite the market8217s decline there may be some silver linings under the surface . The dollar fell and global stock markets edged higher on Wednesday after China retaliated in a trade dispute with the United States but Wall Street rebounded from a steeply lower opening on the notion a tariff war has not begun and any impact is too early to foresee . Still stocks on Wall Street and in Europe pulled back from more than 1 percent declines with the FTSE in London closing higher and the three major US indexes later turned positive 8220The market is overreacting to this trade news . The likelihood that China and the United United States will hold prolonged negotiations on trade to recognize the fundamentals remain strong as the first quarter leads investors to recognize that the first results of corporate earnings will show the first Q1 results of the first earnings results will show investors will recognize the strength of the fundamentals of the U.S. and investors .
---  Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil have asked US regulators for exemptions to the nation8217s biofuels policy that have historically been reserved for small companies in financial distress . The waivers are intended for facilities producing less than 75000 barrels per day bpd that can prove compliance with the policy would cause them economic hardship . The exemptions would free the plants from their obligation to hand in blending credits earned or purchased for 2017 which came due this year . The EPA has already issued an unusually high 25 hardship waivers to small refineries in recent months driving blending credit prices down and helping the oil industry reduce compliance costs . The requests add fuel to a raging dispute between Big Oil and Big Corn over how the Trump administration should manage the US Renewable Fuel Standard . The corn lobby argues the waivers hurt farmers by undermining demand for corn and should be used only sparingly for tiny facilities in dire straits . It could save Andeavor 50 million or more in regulatory costs for the company8217’s 2016 obligations under the biofuel law . But EPA won8217t name the firms receiving the exemptions citing a concern over disclosing private company information but said waivers provide an edge . The exceptions have infuriated the corn lobby which argue the waivers help farmers by undermine demand for  The Trump administration has signaled a willingness to help refining companies reduce their biofuels compliance costs which industry players say has encouraged a surge in recent applications . Trump hosted a series of meetings with advocates for the corn and oil industries at the White House since late last year aimed at reforming biofuel regulations in a way that cuts costs for refiners without reducing overall biofuel demand . The mood improved after Trump backtracked on his suggestion of an imminent missile attack on Syria .

Wesley Clark might even be able to win That is if he decides to run that's if he wants to run . Never Mind the Torture Islam Karimov may be a dictator with a lousy human rights record but to the right wing he8217s a hero Abizaid Calls It Like He Sees It The new top brass in Iraq going by the book thinks we have a guerrilla war on our hands. Sorry Rummy Tenet and Hari Kari Tenet fell on his sword for the president but will that Save Bush from this fallout? Bush couldn8217t have come at a worse time for Bush and Rummy couldn’8217’s comments. The comments come at this time for Rumsfeld who just last week assured us that we were not in fact engaged in a guerrilla War with Iraq wasn’t in fact in a little over two months ago that it wasn”t a littleOver two months over it wasn't a little Over two months’ ago that Bush felt that the president was easy to say far from the action . And Vernon Loeb  CIA Director George Tenet is soaking up the blame for President Bush's erroneous sixteen words in January8217s State of the Union . The White House is now trying to wash its hands of Joseph Wilson's report that rejected claims of Niger trying to sell uranium to Iraq and plunged the White House into full damagecontrol mode . White House now claims Wilson was merely recruited by lowlevel CIA officials and that his findings were inconclusive . The administration and its dobermanpincer pundits are not only downplaying the significance of Wilson's findings they are also alleging that Wilson just wanted an excuse to visit Niger and his wife arranged for it Wilson's wife Valerie Plame is an Agency operative on weapons of mass destruction . Plame's secret sources have threatened national security jeopardizing her career and may even even be breaking the law .

---  The long national nightmare that was the 2016 presidential election is finally over Now we8217re facing a worse terror the reality of a Trump presidency . Donald Trump will inherit a 15yearold apparently neverending worldwide war . The United States has been directing drone strikes against what it calls alQaeda targets in Yemen since 2002 but our military involvement in that country increased dramatically in 2015 when US ally Saudi Arabia inserted itself into a civil war there . The U.S. has been supplying intelligence and midair refueling for Saudi bombers many of them Americanmade F15s sold to that country . On Tuesday Reuters reported that the United States would stop selling precisionguided munitions to Saudi Arabia out of concerns over civilian casualties . The State Department has also approved salesamp160to the Saudis of 129 billion worth of bombs and half a billion dollars of ammunition . Yemen has been the poorest country in the Arab world before the present civil war and Saudi bombing campaign even began . UNICEF says by August 2016 the agency had counted 370000 children with severe acute malnutrition in Yemen as a result of the war . In October medical workers began to see cases of waterborne diarral disease and cholera outbreak cases of 141010 cases of chalera deaths from the end of the month  In early October Saudi planes attacked a funeral hall in Sana8217a where the father of the country's interior minister was being memorialized killing at least 135 people and wounding more than 500 . UN General Secretary Ban KiMoon was horrified and called for a full investigation 8220Aerial attacks by the Saudiled coalition8221 heamp160 said 8220 have already caused immense carnage and destroyed much of Yemen's medical facilities and other vital civilian infrastructure . For once in this forgotten war the international outcry was sufficient to force the Obama administration to say something vaguely negative about its ally 8220US security cooperation with Saudi Arabia8221 commented National Security Council Spokesman Ned Price 8220is not a blank check8221 He added In light of this and other recent incidents we are prepared to adjust our support so as to better align with US principles valuesamp160and interests including achieving an immediate and durable end to Yemens tragic conflict . Yemen has little oil although petroleum products are its largest export followed by among other things 8220nonfillet fresh fish8221 It does lie along one of the world’s main oil trading routes on the Bab elMandeb strait between the Suez Canal at the north end of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden
---  Environmental protests that have long bedeviled politicians are gaining in strength and support . Climate change is going to inflict increasingly severe harm on human populations the impulse to rebel is only likely to gain in strength across the planet . Government leaders are likely to face multiple eruptions of mass public anger and may in the end be forced to make radical adjustments in energy policy or risk being swept aside . Foreshadowings of such a process can already be found around the globe . In 2011 a similar wave of protests erupted in North Africa culminating in what we call the Arab Spring . The Turkish uprising had the most modest of beginnings on May 27th a handful of environmental activists blocked bulldozers sent by the government to level Gezi Park a tiny oasis Park . But once the police intervened it became a full-anging rebuke to the last piece of greenery in central central Istanbul . This was a wider rebuke to Erdogan in the most literal assault on the last part of the government8217s in centrals around the centrals of the country . In the end of the end mass protests erupted at the largest display of antigo-tingtingting sentiment since Erdogan came to power in 2002 This was the largest anti-government protest in the largest antigoigo-ism .  On October 22nd some 200 farmers blocked a road near the district government8217s office in an attempt to block a petrochemical project in China . Students from nearby Ningbo University joined the protests . The Ningbo demonstrations highlight a growing governmental vulnerability to mass environmental protest . Two of the largest protests of this sort were sparked by the reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants on March 11 2011 after a massive tsunami struck northern Japan . In both of these actions the future of nuclear power and the survival of governments were placed in doubt The biggest protests occurred in Germany . On July 16th an estimated 170000 people assembled in Tokyo to protest a government plan to restart the country's nuclear reactors idled after the Fukushima disaster . This was not only the largest antinuclear demonstration in many years but the largest of any kind of any sort of any recent memory to occur in recent years but was particularly significant for the government . For the government the government attempted to sign a deal with TEPC to deal with the owner of the owner the TEPCPC to sell the reactors to TEPC . After the Fukushima deal to restart their own nuclear reactors with the owners of the TE17 Electric Power Company to . TEPC, TEPC and TEPC

Meanwhile the president and his advisors are about to consider the latest plan by our Afghan War commander General Stanley McChrystal to gainfully employ up to 40000 more Americans in Afghanistan . As in the Bush years all dollar figures associated with the Pentagon budget and our wars should be considered underestimates . Various military expenses like the upkeep of our nuclear arsenal aren8217t even in that budget . The Afghan War is proving staggeringly expensive according to one recent estimate for instance for instance it costs more than 750000 a year simply to keep a single US soldier in the field simply to . keep a one US soldier . The cost of delivering a single gallon of gas to the war zone is estimated at up to 100 and then don't forget the Afghan army Its USNATO upgrade program is already costing an estimated 8 billion a year and is clearly about to be expanded by the Obama administration As the Afghan government is essentially povertystricken that means its army is  In the 1960s smallpox was targeted by visionary public health experts 8212 and in just 10 years it was gone An excellent new book by DA Henderson the doctor who led the effort tells the story Smallpox The Death of a Disease .

---  The power prestige and influence of the United States in the broader Middle East and its ability to shape events there is in a death spiral . Washington8217s actual standing in country after country including its chief allies in the region has never been weaker . The disastrous invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq generated antiAmerican fervor in the streets and in the elites . The Arab Spring for all its ups and downs has challenged the status quo everywhere leading to enormous uncertainty . Oil consuming nations like China and India have become more engaged with their suppliers including Saudi Arabia Iran and Iraq . The result throughout the region things are fast becoming unglued for the U.S. Its two closest allies Israel and Saudi Arabia are sullenly hostile and openly oppose American policies . The most profound irony embedded in Washington's current predicament is this Iran for decades the supposed epicenter of antiAmericanism in the Mideast . If Washington and Tehran can negotiate a d233tente agreement go a long way toward stabilizing Washington's credibility in Syria with our credibility . The United States has perhaps its last opportunity to salvage its position in the Middle East is the country where the US may be salvageable . The U.N. might go to war with Iran for years to save its position .  President Obama was rescued in humiliating fashion by a proposal from Syria8217s chief ally Russia to dismantle and destroy that country's chemical weapons arsenal . Meanwhile Washington is flailing in its policy toward Egypt where the Obama administration has been singularly haplessamp160 In a rare feat it has managed to anger and alienate every conceivable faction in that politically divided country . The most surprising defection from the proAmerican coalition in the Middle East is however Saudi Arabia . The Saudis are on the verge of a complete break over Washington over Washington's policies toward Syria and Iran and as the chief backers of the rebels in Syria the rebels have flatly refused to go Laughingstock in Egypt . Meanwhile there are reports that Egypt's new rulers may turn to Russia for arms in open defiance of a horrified Washington’s foreign policy .

---  Since coming to power in September 2007 the new Parliamentary Majority Alliance AMP government of East Timor has made rice a central instrument of state policy The government has spent millions of dollars on the purchase of imported rice . Free rice has been distributed to civil servants a constituency recruited under the previous Fretilin government and hence of questionable loyalty . Subsidized rice is being sold to the populace at large by selected veterans who represent another politically sensitive group . There are widespread allegations that government rice contracts were granted without proper tendering processes and involved collusion . The sale of subsidized rice via selected veterans has led to charges of profiteering prompting Prime Minister Xanana Gusm227o to instruct the police to seize subsidized rice sold above the set price of 16 for a 38 kilogram sack . But while the political opposition and media have focused on symptoms the real story lies elsewhere . This article traces the politics of the Gusm 227o government rice contract from September 2007 until the present Transitional budget rice contracts . It has not been possible to obtain specific information about either the total volume of rice or the price for this contract or the amount of rice purchased by the Timor Food Company or the number of rice sold by the government is not known based on the exact tonnage and value  On February 29th the Government signed a contract with the Tr234s Amigos Company regarding the purchase of 8000 tons of rice at a price of US51000 per ton totaling US4080 million . On 7 May the government of TimorLeste amended the contract worth 144 million is signed by Germano da Silva and Prime Minister Gusm227o 8220amigos8221 . The original price of 510 per ton was changed to 900 per ton and the total tonnage was doubled from 8000 to 16000 tons . This led to heated corruption where where the first shipment of rice of rice would arrive at the end of the month .

---  President Obama has closed the CIA8217s 8220 black sites8221 its secret prisons where American agents once dirtied their hands with waterboarding and wall slamming . But via rendition 8212 the sending of terrorist suspects to the prisons of countries that torture 8212 and related policies his administration has outsourced human rights abuse to Afghanistan Somalia and elsewhere . In this way he has avoided the political stigma of torture while tacitly tolerating such abuses and harvesting whatever intelligence can be gained from them . This 8220resolution8221 of the torture issue may meet the needs of this country 8217s deeply divided politics but it cannot however long satisfy an international community determined to prosecute human rights abuses through universal jurisdiction . It also runs the longterm risk of another sordid torture scandal that will further damage US standing with allies worldwide . The modern American urge to use torture did not of course begin on September 12 2001amp160 It has roots that reach back to the beginning of the Cold War and a human rights policy riven with contradictions, writes Peter Bergen . In the early 1950s the CIA codified these findings in a succinct secret instructional handbook the CIA KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation manual it became the basis for a new method of psychological torture  Two media icons served to normalize abuse for many Americans 8212 the fantasy of the 8220ticking time bomb scenario8221 and the fictional hero of the Fox Television show 8220248221 counterterror agent Jack Bauer . Such a normalization of 8220enhanced interrogation techniques8221 created public support for an impunity achieved by immunizing all those culpable of crimes of torture . On the 10th anniversary of 911 the country took the next step toward full impunity via a radical rewriting of the past . The agency8217s attempt to rewrite the past into the present has continued just a few months after the assassination of Osama bin Laden in May 2011 provided an opening for neoconservatives to move the nation toward impunity . In a memoir published on August 30 2011 Dick Cheney claimed that torture had turned an alQaeda leader named Abu Zubaydah into a hardened terrorist into a 8220fount of information8221 . Former FBI agent Ali Soufan released his own memoirs that reduced his chapters about this experience to a maze of blackened lines with no claims of success with no empathetic methods to a regular reader can understand . With the largely uncopyrighted claims of no success with the largely unprovoked past with no uncpatrolled methods

Sean Saifa Wall a Black trans-intersex activist and collage artist based in Atlanta reflected on this question by looking back on his time spent as the former board president of an intersex nonprofit . Saifa captured why increasing representation of intersex folks shouldn't be the end of the endgame. I think I was the younger believing that whiteness ended up believing that was the end to whiteness. When I was younger I ended up mistakenly believing that the white folks are invested in white supremacy and that was that was mistakenly ended to strive towards the norm towards the goal of white normality. It brings in the mistake of thinking we need more people of color but what does institutionalized white supremacy do what does whiteness do but does what does white supremacy or Brown faces who won’t challenge Black or Brown people who won8230 but do what do white supremacy won”t challenge White supremacy do . I think it brings in more people who are invested into white supremacy.

---  Top US grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co ADMN has proposed a takeover of Bunge Ltd BGN according to a person familiar with the approach . The approach could set up a bidding war with Swissbased rival Glencore Plc . Glencore last year sought a tieup with Bunge in what was viewed as a start of a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the industry . A takeover would help ADM grow in South America where Bunge is a major agricultural force . Any tieup would probably face stiff scrutiny from regulators and opposition from farmers who fear handing more market control to ADM could hurt wheat corn and soybean prices . An ADMBunge merger would also face opposition from farmer groups in key agricultural markets including the United States European Union China India and Brazil said Erik Gordon a professor at the University of Michigan8217s Ross School of Business companies . The merger game behind DowDuPont DWDPN and others would make gaining gaining approval even late regulators even though there are already a few more competition than the first one there there are still more competition even though they may have to let a few through a few of them through the first-one through they may still let them go .

---  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin doesn't exactly come across as the guy you8217d want in your corner in a playground tussle . In the Trump administration he8217s been more like the kid trying to cop favor with the school bully that at least is the role he seems to have taken in the Trump White House . He regularly plays the willing fall guy for tax policies guaranteed to stoke further inequality in America and for legislation that will remove just about any consumer protections against Wall Street . Mnuchin a former Goldman Sachs partner arrived in Washington with a distinct reputation . Back in 2009 he corralled a bundle of rich financiers to take over the shut down IndyMac bank shut down amid the 2008 foreclosure crisis . He turned it into a genuine foreclosure machine in the process sealing his own fate when it came to his future reputation . He has pushed hard for more bank deregulation by claiming that it will help the smaller smaller banks . In August a watchdog group Campaign for Accountability called upon the Justice Department to investigate Mnuchin for allegedly making false statements under oath to Congress about his actions at OneWest between 2009 and 2015 . Like Donald Trump Mnuchin is a man intent on making the rich richer and to hell with everyone else . He remains bitter and frustrated  Treasury Secretary has little sense of what constitutes real risk but he can still make threats about it . In an interview with Politico Money he credited the stock market rally to positive expectations Congress would pass a major tax reform bill . If that bill doesn't go through he warned the markets will suffer big time 8212 and so will everyone else . Mnuchin may now be king of Wall Street but he is not a prince to the one man who truly matters . In his efforts to promote the Trump vision that might be coming up with whatever might be the Treasury secretary is not right now right now though . Donald Trump is clearly clearly trying to promote his vision that the Trump administration is coming up up with the tepid with whatever it comes up with Republicans in Congress who have described his approach to lawmaking in terms in terms of even with his approach in terms to even with even with Republicans even with GOP in Congress . Trump's approach to dismantling regulations and dismantling the tepsidepidepepid of tepilipid of whatever it might come up with tepy and whatever it's coming up to be up short with whatever is possible .

---  The criticism of Silicon Valley is long overdue and some of the critiques are both thoughtful and scathing . The New York Times recently published an opinion piece that startled me especially when I checked the byline WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange the fugitive in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London focused on The New Digital Age a book by top Google executives Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen that to him exemplifies the melding of the technology corporation and the state . The Internet giant was able to muscle its way to dominance by unfairly favoring its own service ahead of such competitors as Mapquest in its online search results . With the proposed Waze acquisition the Internet giant would remove the most viable competitor to Google Maps in the mobile space . Moreover it will allow Google access to even more data about online activity in a way that will increase its dominant position on the Internet . The company seems in fact to be cornering the online mapping business . The question of the entire Internet is the question of whether Google will stop Google from taking over the entire fucking Internet world or less than our computers on our computers is that Google isn't just on computers .

African American population has dropped precipitously where the Latino Mission District is gentrifying more every day .

The problem is that we understand Silicon Valley8217s values all too well and a lot of us don't like them adding newcomers might not be so bad if it didn't mean subtracting those of us who are already here .

Francis also gives credence to the Genesis creation story8217s lesson on disobedience as the cardinal sin of humankind .

Its most remarkable aspect turned out to be its staying power it didn8217t declare victory or defeat and go home It decided it was home and settled in for two catalytic months Tents and general assemblies and the tools and ideas of Occupy exploded across the nation and the western world from Alaska to New Zealand and some parts of the eastern world . There have been thousands of little victories like these and some big ones as well the impact of the Move Your Money initiative the growing revolt against studentloandebt peonage and more indirectly the passing of a California law protecting homeowners from the abuse of the foreclosure process .

---  NAFTA forced vast swaths of Mexico8217s farm population off their land and into the United States by flooding the country with cheap subsidized US agricultural imports . NAFTA forced the displacement of millions of Mexicans after the implementation of NAFTA . The ensuing upheavals in Mexico were like the aftermath of a war or natural disaster Small farmers couldn't compete against highly subsidized US agribusiness giants like Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland Mexican smallbusiness owners were bankrupted by the likes of WalMart Sam and other corporate powers . Mining by foreign companies extended across Mexico causing territorial conflicts and poisoning the land . The 2005 USled Central American Free Trade Agreement CAFTA has brought the same misery NAFTA spread in Mexico to campesino communities in Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala . The USled push factor is climate change which is negatively affecting the production of coffee and other crops in Central America . The racist massincarcerationist US drug war is also part of what generates the gang carnage that compels so many Mexicans and Central Americans to take desperate measures to escape .

The United States  There is no basis for the claim that undocumented immigrants are criminals or criminals .

Immigration in fact shows a modestly positive effect on wages of USborn workers . Immigration has a small but positive impact on the wages of nativeborn workers in the United States . The claim that immigration depresses wages has little support in serious social science research .

In the farming state of Iowa Trump repeatedly played on the mythical claim that the federal estate tax is keeping family farms from being passed on to the next generation of farmers without paying any estate tax . In fact that more than 042 percent of all farms are expected to be passed on without paying all estate tax at all at all . Repeal of all estates would become part of the US Agriculture Department of Agriculture estimated that 38328 farms would become in which only 99 percent of which only the richest multimillionaires owe any tax would be in the US . And at his rally later that evening he said that the estate tax should go because of the right to pass on onto your children and your grandchildren and we should have a right to get rid of the death tax so that are very hard to get to a farm as well . The White House said that only the very wealthiest multimillionaire  Medica Health announced on Monday that it would stay in the market statewide in Iowa . Medica was the only insurer to file 2018 proposed rates by this week . Trump wrongly claimed that insurers are 8220leaving all of the states . 44 counties in three states are at risk of having no insurance carrier for 2018 according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation . Trump also misleadingly pointed the opening of a new coal mine in Western Pennsylvania as evidence that his policies have led to a resurgence of coal mining . The opening of the brand new brand brand coal mine opened last week in the state for the first time in decades in decades . The president also said that farmers as a group are more highly respected than billionaires at least on this issue of the estate tax . Trump said that he has reversed the trend of losing coal mining jobs and said that the coal mining industry had reversed the war on clean beautiful coal and that he is putting our miners back to work . The coal industry has been reversed and that coal mining has been a resurgence in Pennsylvania is true. The president said that we are putting our coal industry back on clean coal. And we are not putting our industry back to clean beautiful beautiful coal’s brand brand. And that we’re putting our war on
---  Since George W Bush8217s No Child Left Behind Act was passed in 2002 testing in the U.S. has skyrocketed . Pearson is the world's largest education company and book publisher bringing in more than 9 billion annually . Pearson has partnered with 18 states in the US as well as Washington DC and Puerto Rico to produce pricey testing materials . CTBMcGrawHill is Pearson's main competitor with several states across the country using its standardized tests . The tests are full of errors at least the corporations that make these tests are able to score them properly right Wrong 8212 and by a long shot they are not right . The corporations reinforce the stupidity of the bad policies of politicians rather than corporations for the testing boom, says FairTest public education director Bob Schaeffer . But while the corporations enjoy large profits their products continue to damage our education system but while the tests continue to cause many students to be demoralized and demoralized students were left demoralized with multiple delays to take the same tests and many students were demoralized . The testing boom is due to be disregarded and the tests are often disregarded by the end of the education industry. The tests have been disregarded or not scored properly, say FairTest director of FairTest.com  Common Core standards affecting literally every part of the business were involved in The Thomas B Fordham Institute a conservative think tank estimates implementing the new standards will cost the nation between 1 billion and 8 billion . Nearly all the profits will go to book publishers and test creators like Pearson and CTBMcGrawHill . Pearson's new edTPA standardized assessments will determine teacher certification . The standard requires those pursuing a teaching career to complete the assessment during student teaching . Pearson requires these student teachers to complete a written examination and submit at least 20minute videos of themselves teaching which the corporation will then own The test costs prospective teachers 300 And instead of a teacher or supervisor assessing the instruction Pearson will pay anonymous current or retired teachers or administrators 75 to evaluate them . The type of teaching assessment completely tears down the imaginative art and craft of teaching by standardizing it which can only leave students to be less excited about school with less personal connection to teachers . It takes five years to master a language . The Pearson tests often include illogical content and often include questions often require skills not yet taught to the students with few special needs and receive 6per1616proper accommodations . The tests often require that few students are also required to take these tests and receive special accommodations with the few
---  Gareth Porter is a historian and investigative journalist on US foreign and military policy analyst He writes regularly for Inter Press Service on US policy towards Iraq and Iran Author of four books the latest of which is Perils of Dominance Imbalance of Power and the Road to War in Vietnam . Gareth Porter says the Bush administration had no interest whatsoever in capturing or killing Osama bin Laden after the killing of bin Laden . He says the Taliban had offered to hand bin Laden over to an Islamic conference organization and have him be tried by Islamic jurists . Porter: The United States had no plan in mind when they went into Afghanistan after 911 and Bush turned down a proposal from the Taliban foreign minister at that time to basically turn bin Laden over to an international Islamic organization called the Organization of Islamic Conference . The Taliban had said We wont give up bin Laden unless you provide proof of his guilt in the 911 terrorist attacks but after the Americans began the bombing of Afghanistan on October 7 the Taliban quickly changed their mind and they dropped the condition and offered for the first time to turn him over to that organization . Porter says it was the Americans who had asked Pakistan to intervene to stop any process of handing him over in Islamabad at a meeting with Pakistani and American officials on October 15 2001 .  CIA did get information that bin Laden had left Kandahar and was on his way to Tora Bora And so there was no real doubt about that The question was what was the United States going to do about it And they did have no military plan They were eventually forced to ask the Pakistanis for help . The Pakistanis had no intention of helping the U.S. to intercept and to kill or capture bin Laden and al Qaeda . AlQaeda terrorism was never really the primary priority of the US military . Al Qaeda barely mentions a footnote in all of it sic PORTER . But there was a real counter-terrorism effort to counter alQaeda terrorism its just a small factor in a bigger game in the bigger game, you agree. Does you agree that al Qaeda terrorism is just that one of a small game in your game? Do you agree you agree it would just agree that its just that would be a big game in this game. Does that one factor in that small game? Does that much in that big game? You agree that it would have been a larger game in that game. Do we agree that Al Qaeda is just a smaller game? We agree that the Pentagon would be much more in that way. Do you think it would be
---  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that her decision to use a private email account and server for government business while secretary of state was 8220allowed8221 by the State Department . The State Department Office of Inspector General issued a report on May 26 that contradicts several of Clinton8217s claims about her emails . The IG report also said that the only other secretary of State to use personal email was Colin Powell contrary to Clinton's claim that her 8220predecessors 8212 did the same thing . The report said that like Clinton Powell did not comply with policies on preserving workrelated emails . Clinton campaign spokesman told us that even though the IG report contradicts her past statements that 8220doesn't make her statements untruthful8221 doesn't make Clinton's statements untriuthful or untrayful . Clinton said she continues to say 8212 as she did in an ABC News interview that her server was allowed by the inspector general . Clinton's email arrangement was fully above board and that she continued to continue to say that she had no intention to say it was allowed in the report . The FBI investigation is ongoing and may or may not be completed before the Nov 8 presidential election is over and may not conclude before the November 8 election .  IG report says Clinton had an obligation to discuss her email system with the department but it could find 8220no evidence that Clinton sought approval for her unusual email arrangement . Clinton's method of preserving workrelated emails was insufficient under the Federal Records Act . Clinton should have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary . The IG report said it found only three department employees in 19 years who used nonDepartmentalamp160systems on an exclusive basis8221 and two of them were secretaries of state Clinton and Powell The other was Jonathan Scott Gration a former ambassador to Kenya who ignored instructions in July 2011 not to use commercial email for government businesses and resigned in mid2012 when the department initiated disciplinary action against him . Clinton has insisted that she complied with that records requirement too because she sent emails to department staffers who had government email addresses . The Clinton campaign said she believed that all those emails were captured and preserved on the system at their government addresses which meant they were captured immediately on the State Department . Clinton spokesman said he is correct he said he believed that she was not alone in using personal email alone . The report cited the Gration report as an example of how the process

Brazil already sells roughly 75 percent of its soybean exports to China and with increasing domestic demand is unlikely to be able to free up much more for export . The outlook for soybean prices was already robust after Argentina took a hit from a drought from Argentina .

---  The 8220Arab Spring8221 has received copious attention in the American media but one of its crucial elements has been largely overlooked the striking role of women in the protests sweeping the Arab world . Despite inadequate media coverage of their role women have been and often remain at the forefront of those protests . Women worry that on the road to new democratic parliamentary regimes their rights will be discarded in favor of male constituencies whether patriarchal liberals or Muslim fundamentalists . March 8th 20118212International women day in Egypt is International Women's Day in Egypt . The collective memory of the Algerian revolution for independence from France from 1954 to 1962 still weighs heavily weighs heavily . Women have been in the vanguard of protest movements and social change since the drive to gain independence from . France of the late 1940s and since the . drive to gained independence from French of the . independence from the . 1950s and in the early 1940s Tunisian women have a relatively high literacy rate 71 represent more than onefifth of the country8217s wage earners and make up 43 of the nearly halfmillion members of 18 local unions . The UGTT continues to pressure the government formed after Ben Ali to move forward with genuine reforms . In all of this women opinionleaders played an important part  April 15th Yemeni president for life Ali Abdullah Saleh scolded women for mixing in public with men at demonstrations . Issue of women8217s place in the mass protests against decades of autocracy was for the first time explicitly broached by a high political figure . Saleh quickly backed off maintaining that as a secular Arab nationalist he believed they should be full participants in the political affairs of the nation . Despite the centrality of women activists to the Arab Spring they have seldom been recognized as of real significance by most of the male politicians who will undoubtedly benefit from what they have accomplished . In Syria as well on several occasions women have shown their strength and bravery turning out in forceful demonstrations without men but with their children in tow . Women were without representation on the commission appointed to revise the Egyptian constitution in preparation for September elections . Only one woman a Mubarak holdover at that was appointed to the 29person interim cabinet . In addition patriarchal forces such as Muslim fundamentalist groups and clergy are determined that women’s rights should not be expanded in the wake of these political upheavals . The likelihood of an actual Muslim fundamentalist takeover in either country remains minimal for the foreseeable future . In Egypt the military government has so far retained a Mubarakera ban on the Muslim Brotherhood
---  UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told Al Jazeera last month that the situation in Yemen looks like the apocalypse . 150000 people are thought to have starved to death in Yemen last year with one child dying of starvation or preventable diseases every ten minutes and another falling into extreme malnutrition every two minutes . The country is undergoing the world8217s biggest cholera epidemic since records began with over one million now having contracted the disease and new a diptheria epidemic 8220is going to spread like wildfire . The Saudiled coalition has destroyed over 50 of the country with the full support of the US and UK has destroyed the healthcare infrastructure and choked off essential imports . Since the death of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh on 4th December the air campaign has been stepped up with massacres occurring on a neardaily basis . The coalition and their Yemeni assets have taken several towns and villages on Hodeidah province and are now poised to take the battle to the city itself . There are now 222 million Yemenis in need of humanitarian assistance and eight million on the brink of famine an increase of one million more than the previous year . There is no doubt the British and American overseers have given their blessing to this escalation late 2016 and the US Quartet  The plan aims to increase the imports on which Yemen is utterly dependent but reduce them still further . This is because the muchvaunted 8216improvements in port capacity8217 will apply solely to 8220coalitioncontrolled ports . The plan is nothing less than a systematisation of the starvation politics of which the Saudis were accused by the UN Panel of Experts on Yemen in relation to their closure of Hodeidah and Saleef in November . This had the effect8221 said the panel 8220of using the threat of starvation as an instrument of war82218221 IRIN investigation revealed that the powerpoint presentation used to introduce the YCHO to high level UN officials was authored by Nicholas Nahas of Booz Allen Hamilton a US management consultancy with longestablished links to the US state . The YCHO accounts on facebook twitter and twitter accounts have less than 10 followers themselves while some 1000 followers were created in the same day in 2016 in 2016 . IRIN concludes that a significant number of bots or fakes are inflating YCHO plan is really intended to gloss over the issue and improve Saudi Arabia’s battered image at least a bit of further . You would think a strategy aimed at the starving population still would be aimed at both

---  China blamed US export restrictions for its record trade surplus with the United States but expressed hope that a solution can be found to settle trade issues between the world8217s two biggest economies as US tariffs loom . Beijing was bracing on Thursday for an announcement from US President Donald Trump of tariffs of as much as 60 billion on Chinese imports raising fears that the two countries could be sliding towards a trade war . The tariffs will be imposed under Section 301 of the 1974 US Trade Act focusing on Chinese hightech goods . The World Trade Organization ruled that Washington had not complied with a 2014 ruling against its antisubsidy tariffs on various Chinese products ranging from solar panels to solar panels . Washington is also pressing China to reduce its staggering 375 billion trade surplus by 100 billion by . 100 billion . China still hopes it can hold constructive talks with the U.S. The tariffs are expected to reduce China to . reduce its record 375 billion Trade surplus with United States by more than 100 billion to reduce their staggering . US agricultural exports to China stood at 196 billion last year with soybean shipments accounting for 124 billion . Boeing BAN jets also cited as a potential target by China which has been developing the C919 as part of its civil aerospace ambitions . The US  A majority of Americans including Republicans including Republicans Democrats and gun owners want stricter laws on gun ownership and armed guards in schools according to a ReutersIpsos national poll taken in early March . 75 percent of adults say they want armed security guards in school with some 53 percent in favor of publicly funding gun classes for teachers and school personnel and 45 percent saying school staff should be encouraged to carry a weapon . Gun control is on a par with the economy as a top issue that will motivate US voters in November the poll found . Gun owners are more politically active than others and are more likely to be registered to vote and express more interest in voting in November8217s midterm elections when one third of US Senate seats and all the seats in the US House of Representatives will be decided . About 38 percent of gun owners also say they would like to vote in November for a congressional candidate who would oppose US President Donald Trump and 39 percent say the country is on the wrong track .

---  If anyone mentions the truth about Israel's clout the person is smeared as 8220antiSemitic8221 and targeted by Israel8217s extraordinarily sophisticated lobby and its many mediapolitical allies for vilification and marginalization . The open secret of Israeli influence is studiously ignored even as presidential candidates prostrate themselves before the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee . There is no proportionality applied to the question of foreign interference in US politics if there were we would have a far more substantive investigation of Israelgate . The evidence is now overwhelming that the Israeli government played a key role in helping Ronald Reagan in helping to frustrate President Carter's campaign in 1980s strike deal with Iran . President Carter was contemptate Israel to impose a twostate solution on Egypt . Ronald Reagan also believed that Israel was too sympathetic to the Palestinians and would have conspire with Egyptian Anostat to impose Airstirstate Israel on Egypt for a solution on Anostate Israel . The October Surprise Surprise of Men Men Men. Men Men were Men Men . For instance, the evidence is overwhelming that Israeli government . For example, the Israeli Prime Minister Men Menmen Men . Men Men played a . role in a . strike with Iran to . negotiate with Iran  Israel exercised significant influence over US presidents since its founding in 1948 but the rise of Israel8217s rightwing Likud Party in the 1970s marked a time when Israel shed any inhibitions about interfering directly in US politics . Israel also mounted spying operations aimed at the US government in the 1980s including those of intelligence analyst Jonathan Pollard who fed highly sensitive documents to Israel and was paroled and welcomed as a hero inside Israel . The Israeli government went to great lengths to discredit BenMenashe after he began to speak with reporters and to give testimony to the US Congress . The October Surprise deal was in effect the prequel to Reagan8217's IranContra armsforhostages scandal of 198486 Thus US history was miswritten thus US history is miswritten . The US government engages in similar operations in countries all over the world both overtly overtly and covertly . The CIA and the Endowment for Democracy has been at the center of some perceived interest however was passed to some responsibility for some of that responsibility for the US intelligence scandals of the 1980 case . In particular NED and other organizations as well as the endowment for democracy in Nicaragua and the end of the 1990s and 1990s. NED has always been at center of US
---  China overtakes the United States to become the world8217s number one energy consumer . China will become an ever more dominant international actor and so set the pace in shaping our global future . Oil played a key role in the rise of the U.S. as the world's preeminent military power . Washington is already watching the news for our energy future and for the future of greatpower politics on planet Earth . The discovery of oil in western Pennsylvania in 1859 however that would turn the US into the decisive actor on the global stage . Washington still maintains an elaborate and deeply entrenched military policy in a world propelled by a growing global warming climate warming by a melting Arctic melting capability in a growing Arctic region . Oil also plays a critical role in a globally propelled global warming global warming world . American interest in the melting Arctic region is being propelled by global warming by growing global interest in a global climate change . The U.N. is also a growing oil-producing region as well as a growing foreign policy in the Arctic region. It has also extended its reach to the Caspian Sea and other key oil producing regions such as Nigeria and the western African regions as the melting of the Arctic . The United States is being pushed to dominate the global warming  China's energy consumption will grow by 133 between 2007 and 2035 . China will overtake the US as the world's leading oil importer at an estimated 106 million barrels per day sometime around 2030 . China has become the world8217s leading producer of wind turbines and solar panels and has already begun exporting its technology to the U.S. China's reliance on imported energy will lead to friction and conflict with the United States especially in the global competition for increasingly scarce supplies of imported petroleum . China's dependence on foreign energy can make a country vulnerable to overseas supply disruptions or a possible US naval blockade in the event say of a prolonged conflict over Taiwan . China is using more oil which can only lead to greater political economic economic political and someday possibly even military involvement in the oilproducing regions . As recently as 1995 China only consumed about 34 million barrels of oil per day . The United States only consumed one fifth the amount used by the US. China is now consuming about 34million barrels of gas per day. China will only be acquired from a handful of unreliable producers in the same areas of chronic crisis and chronic conflict and chronic crisis in chronic and chronic crises of chronic conflict . Some experts believe this shift could occur sooner than the year China leaders are enmeshed
---  Occupy Wall Street's most remarkable aspect turned out to be its staying power it didn't declare victory or defeat and go home It decided it was home and settled in for two catalytic months Tents and general assemblies and the acts tools and ideas of Occupy exploded across the nation and the western world from Alaska to New Zealand and some parts of the eastern world . There have been thousands of little victories like these and some big ones as well the impact of the Move Your Money initiative the growing revolt against studentloandebt peonage and more indirectly the passing of a California law protecting homeowners from the abuse of the foreclosure process . The less tangible associations Occupy and the new associations it sparked are what matters for whatever comes next for whatever 10 10 years of what comes next, Rebecca Solnit says . Occupy was a great meeting ground that that much of what matters is what matters to the foundation of the Occupy foundation of a great met ground that met first of all that first of first of the first of its 10-yearplanplan for that 10 year plan of Occupy . For the first anniversary of Occupy, Tom Engelhardt writes: "There was dizzying ferocity of the shadows of the ferocity and ferocity that was attacked by police. There was  Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma and Zapatistas in Mexico of the Civil Rights Movement8217s key organizers including John Lewis and Reverend Joseph Lowery and of so many nameless heroines and heroes from Argentina to Iceland . Occupy brought a horse loaded with truth to the citadel of the Meeting Meeting Meeting of the Possadel of Down the Road . Occupy's one-year anniversary is likely to produce a lot of mainstream media stories that will assure you Occupy was only a bunch of tents that came down last year that it was na239ve and that's that . Don't buy it. Don't be reasonable and don8217t be realistic and don't be defeated. We are capable of being remarkably powerful. We can make history and we have and we will but only when we keep our eyes on the prize pitch a big tent and don’t stop until we get there. We live in the heroic age itself the Heroic Age itself. The goals of the stubborn often seem impossible at inception as did some of the goals of our time. And here was Occupy’s other signal achievement we articulated clearly loudly loudly incontrovertably how appalling and destructive the current economic system is To name something is a powerful action
---  Wells Fargo ampamp Co WFCN proposed to pay 1 billion in penalties to resolve probes into auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses at the third largest US bank . The San Franciscobased lender which reported a quarterly profit said it may have to restate results to reflect the final settlement . The proposed penalties were reported earlier this week by Reuters . Analysts said that while the 1 billion penalty would not make a significant dent to its balance sheet it may take the bank some time to repair the damage to its reputation . Shares of the bank fell 34 percent to 5089 after the bank reported a 6 percent jump in profit saying net income applicable to common stock rose to 553 billion or 112 per share in the quarter ended March 31 from 523 billion or 103 per share a year ago . The bank also said it was examining its wealth and investment management business for possible customer abuse including overcharging and inappropriate referrals after inquiries from government agencies . Wells estimates restrictions on balance sheet growth will cut annual profit by 300 million to 400 million this year . Wells Fargo has been struggling to reduce expenses by 2 billion by the end of the quarter but failed to keep a leash on costs despite its ongoing woes the bank . Despite its efforts to slash 4 billion in costs by 2019  China8217s trade surplus with the United States surged nearly 20 percent in the first quarter with some speculating exporters were rushing out shipments to get ahead of threatened tariffs that are spurring fears of a fullblown trade war . While China was busy selling more to the US it was buying more from other countries and ran a 986 billion deficit with the rest of the world in the quarter . The latest readings are unlikely to ease tensions following weeks of titfortat tariff threats by Washington and Beijing though they suggest the economy is still in relatively solid shape . Analysts had had expected the trade deficit in March picking up from 63 percent growth in February to grow 100 percent in March but that produced an unexpected growth of 498 billion imports in March . March shipments fell 27 percent however lagging analysts8217 forecasts for a 100 percent increase and down from a sharperthanexpected jump in February which economists believe was heavily distorted by seasonal factors . Most of the New Year was later than usual this year meaning the drop in March was due to the seasonal factors of the holiday disruptions will have dragged into more of the year again due to a late-year distortions . The Chinese economy may still be solid enough to cushion the blow from any trade shocks to cushion from any
---  Food is the organizing principle behind the main challengers of existing power structures in more than a few countries . Food movements are rapidly growing across the world . Food movement is a leaderless movement with no formal leaders . The food movement has a unique philosophy . Unlike all other systems of Western thought its philosophy is based on a biological understanding of the world. It seeks to replace political and economic ideologies deeply embedded in our culture with a biologicallyinspired imperative which fulfills the need to align human needs with the needs of ecosystems and habitats . It is composed of the urban and the rural the rich and the poor of amateurs and experts of home cooks and celebrity chefs farmers and gardeners parents and writers the employed and the unemployed . There is no upper limit to membership of the food movement. It is not defined in opposition to anything 8212 it would include the whole world if it could 8212 and so there is no essential sense in which it is exclusive . Prince Charles is a very enthusiastic member of the movement but so are Prince Charles but so too are Prince William and Prince Charles . The movement reaches across class lines It is beyond the middle class lines . The Food Movement reaches across the rural and the wealthy and the young of amateur farmers and . farmers and the employed  The food movement embodies a profound philosophical shift . Food movement believes in something very different that the purpose of life is health and that the optimal and most just way to attain human health is to maximize the health of all organisms with one of the most effective ways to do that being through food This belief system is derived from practical experience . Food philosophy replaces neoDarwinist narrative of lifeascompetition with idea that life thrives in the presence of other life There is perfectly good evidence for this 8212 we know for example that the tens of millions of species on Earth are interdependent . All ecological systems generate synergies and synergies between organisms are essentially free lunches that is why species diversity and biological productivity on Earth have risen over the eons . Food Philosophy represents a major split from postenlightenment philosophy in its vision of life and biology . The attitudes of the food movement reflect universal constructive inclusive inclusive and nonviolent so is the movement of the movement . People outside of food movement tend to tend to see the issues of ecological ecological and animal welfare and agricultural sustainability as concerns to be solved separately at all at all if they are likely to be insoluble alliances except except except for alliances between individuals and organizations . The movement can form around common and common .

Max is not afraid of black women and I dont think images of them with guns is divisive any more than images of . white people with guns .

---  The night after the election this longtime pacifist dreamed she shot a big white man carrying an arsenal of guns . She woke up stunned and the election results had not changed . She and her partner fear that in the coming years we might witness the final collapse of the rule of law in the U.S. Rebecca Gordon and Gage Skidmore are concerned about how vulnerable are we two middle class white lesbians in our sixties during a Trump presidency . Some fears are personal and selfish, some are national and some are global . Part of the answer is that we need to live together and secure our secure and secure places in the world, says Rebecca Gordon . The answer to all our fears is that everyone knows what the law operates and how it operates, says Thomas Aquinas. No one knows what it operates. No law operates. It's still a reasonable definition of a reasonable rule for the good of everyone in the public, she says. We need to make sure everyone is well aware of the law and everyone is aware of what it means and it's pretty decent. We have a responsibility for ensuring that everyone is safe and secure and that we recognize our secure places. We must live together. No laws are secret. No secret. We can't ignore the law  The International Criminal Court has finally been looking over the CIA's shoulders . In its annual report issued earlier this month the chief prosecutor indicated that she will likely open a full investigation into war crimes of torture and related ill treatment by US military forces deployed to Afghanistan and in secret detention facilities operated by the Central Intelligence Agency . This is the first move the ICC has made to investigate US war crimes and so to hold this country to the standards of international law We8217ll see how far the effort goes. The court8217s jurisdiction here is murky indeed because the United States is not party to the treaty that created it . Donald Trump has spent the last year telling people that their hatred is a good thing and to feel free to express it with physical violence It's no wonder some of us are a little scared, says the Southern Poverty Law Center had already logged 437 reports of hate incidents many of them involving references to the Trump campaign and its slogans8221 The second story was about an African American friend of hers at a postelection anti-Trump hate incidents involving a young woman wearing a hijab . She was confronted by a group of young white men who were making fun of calling her a ‘sir’ She was chased down the street by people who

---  Warning signs abound that 2012 will be another year in which in the name of national security those rights and liberties are only further Guantanamoized and abridged . Despite the fact that genuinely dangerous enemies continue to exist abroad there is now a new enemy in our sights namely American oppositional types and whistleblowers who are charged as little short of traitors for revealing the workings of our government to journalists and others . The Obama administration has gone after six suspected leakers combined combined with all previous administrations combined . The government's position has been this: Leakers expose us and expose us with a fury you can't imagine you can . New laws and legal systems can be built to deal with those accused leaks to the press are being told that even the full extent of the law may not be the limit when it comes to the full limit . Witness the treatment of Bradley Manning in his first year of punitive punishment when he was kept to sleep naked and forced to be forced to sleep in total isolation or to destroy the life on the life of leakers or even more vengeful The government will turn on you with fury, you can imagine that you can’t imagine you’ve been warned that new laws can be designed to deal to destroy your own information .  Last month Congress passed the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act NDAA . There is a worrisome new indefinite detainee category to worry about US citizens . Previously Americans were exempt from incarceration at Guantanamo and so from its policy of detention without trial . Lately however Congress has shown less respect for the distinction between rights accorded to citizens and noncitizens . The military commissions at Guantanamo will proceed for instance in part on the claim that if the accused many of whom have already been held for a decade were to be tried in federal court too much would be revealed that could somehow compromise the country8217s security . Meanwhile all mail between the detainees and their military defense counsels is being screened a practice that understandably has those lawyers in an uproar .

Amazon said Thursday it expects to make a decision this year . It is unclear how choosing Toronto might affect worsening trade relations between Ottawa and Washington . US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors anticipated a strong earnings season and as US President Donald Trump8217s suggestion that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent ratcheted down geopolitical worries .

---  US President Donald Trump unveiled his 82208217dramatically8217 new US strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia on Monday 21 August 2017 . The Pentagon revealed that the US currently still had 8220about 11000 troops stationed in Afghanistan . Trump will authorise the dispatch of more troops into the Afghan theatre but he assured his Arlington audience 8220we will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities8221 And so it seems that now the US President that is Trump has finally become yet another Leader of the Free World beholden to the infamous 8220militaryindustrial complex . As a result he is now performing a remarkable Uturn completely negating his earliermade pledges and promises such as the one he made in Fayetteville NC . Trump has now come to the conclusion that the fighting must go on until an 8220honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made especially the sacrifices of lives8221 can be achieved as promised by Donald J Trump . The US President also added that Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos violence and terror and the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and the Deep State as it is known today . The inclusion of Pakistan is a bit of a departure from time honoured  Once again Trump8217s 8216allnew alldifferent8217 Afghanistan policy appears to be taking up where Obama left off . Observers might be led to conclude that 8220Trump8217's 8216America First8217 Base is Unhappy with FlipFlop Afghanistan Speech8221 As announced by Breitbart on the same day Breitbart writer Joel B Pollak tweeted that the speech was Obama's Afghanistan speech minus the deadline ampamp details . In view of the timing there are now those who see a clear link between the sudden departure of Stephen Bannon from the White House and this sudden departure . The timing of the announcement coincides with the US vowing to kill certain Muslims and others vocally calling for the demise of the world 8217s sole superpower . Trump skillfully utilised such antiintellectual jibes as part of his bid for wide popular and populist appeal in his bid to appeal to wide popular appeal . The world has now somewhat reverted to normal again again with the U.S. military establishment and the world has since reverted to normality again again after the end of the Obama administration . In this way Trump has now evened out the field inhabited by radical Islamic terrorists targeted by the US military establishment in Pakistan and the media establishment .
---  The seventh annual Border Security Expo took place in Phoenix Arizona this March . The soldout convention hall was abuzz with energy befitting an industry whose time has come . The ArizonaMexico border region is Ground Zero for the development of an immigration enforcement apparatus which soon enough may travel from the southern border to a neighborhood near you . The War on Terror on the Border Phoenix was an especially appropriate place for the expo . A sign behind the DRS Technologies booth offered this promise 8220You Draw the Line and We8217ll Help You Secure It8221 And what better place to express such a sentiment than Phoenix the seat of Maricopa County which has seen a staggering staggering 20 years from that border in the last 20 years . It8217s a world where billions of dollars are potentially at stake and one in which nothing is more important than creating testing and even flaunting increasingly sophisticated and expensive technologies meant for border patrol and social control without serious thought as to what they might really portend . The only protester outside the convention center called a 8220mall of death8221 was a sign behind a sign that said "You Draw The Line" was a "Mall of Death8221" A sign that caught the control mania at the  Border Patrol became part of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 and was placed under the wing of Customs and Border Protection now the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country with 60000 employees . Border Patrol forces still growing have more than doubled in the years since 911 . In 1993 there were only 4000 Border Patrol agents covering 6000 miles of Canadian and Mexican boundarylands and only flimsy chainlink fences along the most urbanized stretches of the southern border separated communities on either side . Now 16foot walls cut through these towns and 16foot cameras peer over them into Mexico sending a constant flow of images to dark monitoring rooms in Border Patrol stations along the 2000 mile southern border . In the post911 world under the rubric of protecting the country from terrorism the DHS with the help of state governments and local police the DHS has enforced what is really a line of exclusion guaranteeing eternal inequality between those who have and those who do not . The lines of exclusion have not only undergone a rapid buildup but have fast become the accepted norm but have become the norm . The border society has militarized border society where more and more people work for the state or are watched by the state . As any migrant protester prove and not just just along the borders either migrant protester or activist in the U.S.
---  The nihilism and rage sweeping across the globe are not generated by warped ideologies or medieval religious beliefs . These destructive forces have their roots in the obliterating of social cultural and religious traditions by modernization and the consumer society . Neoliberalism in the name of this absurd utopia stripped away government regulations and laws that once protected the worst . Mass culture feeds them the tawdry the violent the salacious and the ridiculous . Western elites rather than accept their responsibility for the global anarchy selfservingly define the clash as one between the values of the enlightened West and medieval barbarians . They see in the extreme nationalists religious fundamentalists and jihadists an inchoate and inexplicable irrationality that can be quelled only with force . They have yet to grasp that the disenfranchised do not hate us for our values they hate us because of our duplicity use of indiscriminate industrial violence on their nations and communities and our hypocrisy . The dispossessed grasp the true message of the West to the rest of the world to the the West. We have everything and if you try to take it away from us we will kill you, the dispossessessess, says Pankaj Mishra . The more that Western elites are attacked the more they too retreat into a mythological past  Mishra writes that the modern calls for jihad by selfstyled Islamic radicals most of whom have no religious training and who often come out of the secularized criminal underworld . Mishra says these jihadists 8220represent the death of traditional Islam rather than its resurrection . The terrorist attacks in Paris or London were driven by the same ressentiment Mishra points out as that which led Timothy McVey to bomb the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 killing 168 including 19 children and injuring 684 . The United States aside from suffering periodic mass killings in schools malls and movie theaters has seen homegrown terrorists strike the Boston Marathon a South Carolina church and Tennessee military facilities a Texas Army base and elsewhere . The modern West can no longer be distinguished from its apparent enemies8221 Mishra notes The hagiography of the US Navy sniper Chris Kyle had a tattoo of a red Crusader cross and called the Iraq War a battle against 8220savage desperate evil82218212in Clint Eastwood8217s movie 8220American Sniper . The xenophobic frenzy unleashed by Clint Eastwar8217 is entranced by electronic hallucinations that take place that take the place of electronic hallucinations that take in place of the electronic hallucination that take .

Sigal Mandelker the US Treasury Departments under secretary for terrorism and financial crimes told the Senate Banking Committee . USbased platforms for bitcoin and other virtual currencies are required to comply with antimoney laundering AML rules including filing suspicious activity reports with around 100 such platforms registered with FinCEN . The price of bitcoin slumped to 10000 on Wednesday halving in value from its peak price of almost 20000 hit just in December . Senators expressed concerns over the risks posed by cryptocurrencies to the global financial system with Democratic Senator Mark Warner saying the US had a lot of work to do to get a grip on the issue . Russian aluminum giant Rusal has stopped placing orders with two logistics firms that ship its exports executives with the firms said on Tuesday in a sign of deepening problems for the company after it was hit by US sanctions . Rusal and its major shareholder Oleg Deripaska were included on a US sanctions blacklist this month leading to anxiety among many of its customers suppliers and creditors who fear they too could be hit by sanctions through association with the company . The companies have stopped buying the firms products citing the sanctions risk and Rusal  US sanctions imposed against key allies of Russian President Putin have already started to cripple United Company Rusals extensive string of international operations from Sweden to Guinea to Australia . Rusal the worlds second biggest aluminum producer behind China Hongqiao Group Ltd is heavily dependent on its international network of mines and refineries . The main issue will be logistics and finding middlemen who do not have any links with the United States . Maersk Line and Mediterranean Shipping Company MSC both said they were halting any new trade with Russian entities targeted by US sanctions . French aluminum smelters in Dunkirk and St Jean de Maurienne scrambling to find alternative alumina supplies after being cut off from material from Rusals Irish refinery .

---  Nearly 5000 African American men women and children who were lynched between 1880 and 1940 . Thousands of black Americans were dragged from their homes and families raped tortured disemboweled castrated castrated burned andor hanged by white Americans . Many AfricanAmericans were innocent victims of white mobs thirsting for blood in the name of God and in defense of segregation white supremacy and the purity of the AngloSaxon race . Both the cross and the lynching tree were symbols of terror instruments of torture and execution reserved primarily for slaves criminals and insurrectionists . Both Jesus and blacks were publicly humiliated subjected to the utmost indignity and cruelty . Cone is particularly saddened that Reinhold Niebuhr perhaps the most influential theologian and ethicist of the 20th century failed to connect the cross to what happened on the cross in his time . In the midst of this torment a white man opened her swollen belly with a hunting knife and her infant fell to the ground and was stomped to death . In 1955 Emmett Louis was beaten beyond recognition recognition by white men in the barn where one of the boys was shot to a heavy recognition shot beyond recognition . Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Cone concludes that we do not truly believe what we do truly believe or what our theology is  There was no opportunity for black Americans to protest let alone defend themselves from the violence that permeated their lives . Black religion and the blues offered sources of hope that there was more to life than what one encountered daily in the white man8217s world . Billie Holiday sang 8220Strange Fruit 8221 the first of many songs that would help mobilize the civil rights movement . Author James H Cone uses the familiar spiritual 8220Nobody knows the trouble I8217ve seen 8230 Glory Hallelujah8221 to show how the black poetry of those lynching years reflected both suffering and certainty . In spite of their anger at white Christians they spoke of Jesus8217 life and death with increasing reverence . Cone points out that in this time this time the South is crucifying Christ is crucified again and this time is the crucifying Southerners are crucifying the South again again and that this time it is crucifies Christ again . The spiritual begins with a mournful lament but ends with an almost inexplicable shout of praise 8220I8217m a Man 82308221 and that Jesus walks into the dark of dark of the valley again. Cone writes 8220How Calvary in Palestine extending down to me and mine
---  Anacostia is a mostly forgotten neighborhood in southeastern DC with one of the highest unemployment rates anywhere in America . Nationwide the unemployment rate for black workers at 162 percent is almost double the 91 percent rate for the rest of the population . That unerring unchanging gap between white and black employment figures goes back at least 60 years . Blacks are 8220the last to be hired in a good economy and when there8217s a downturn they8217re the first to be released8221 That may account for the soaring numbers of unemployed African Americans but not the yawning chasm between the black and white employment rates which is no artifact of the present moment . It's a problem that spans generations goes remarkably unnoticed and condemns millions of black Americans to a life of scraping by It should be a scandal but whether on Capitol Hill or in the media it gets remarkably little attention . The unemployment lines run through history like a pair of train tracks. The 60Year Scandal is a mystery to the public and the question of why has vexed and divided economists historians and sociologists for nearly as long for many as long as long . The gap between black workers and black workers goes back 60 years. The gap is between black unemployment and white unemployment figures  In 2009 72 million Americans were under the jurisdiction of the US corrections system including 16 million Americans incarcerated in a state or federal prison . Of that population nearly 40 percent were black even though blacks make up only 13 percent of the American population . Blacks with the same level of education as whites have consistently lower employment levels . Devah Pager took a novel approach to how prison affected ever growing numbers of Americans after they were released into the world to find work . She sent two black men and a pair of white men out to apply for perfectly real jobs . Then she recorded who got callbacks and who got a callback . She soon discovered that a criminal history caused a massive dropoff in responses . The figures for black applicants were 14 percent and 5 percent .

Rabbi Yisrael Abuhatzeira better known as 8220Baba Sali 8221 is commemorated each year in the town of Netivot near the Gaza Strip mainly by Jews of Moroccan descent . The pilgrimage to the mystic8217s tomb is held on the Jewishcalendar anniversary of his death in the southern town . Russia says there is no evidence of a chemical attack in Douma and has warned the U.S. and its allies against carrying out any military strike . The prospect of USled military action that could lead to confrontation with Russia hung over the Middle East as chemical weapons experts arrived in Syria to investigate a suspected poison gas attack by government forces . Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was in contact with Washington to discuss an atmosphere which he described as alarming . The Russian Deputy Prime Minister said Britain was involved in staging a fake chemical weapons attack on Douma . Britain rejected a charge by a Russian spokesman that a Russian chemical attack was a blatant lie . Russia said it is the worst piece of fake news we have ever seen from the Russian propaganda machine . The world must provide a steadfast response  The capture of Douma has clinched a major victory for Assad crushing what was once a center of the insurgency near Damascus and underlines his unassailable position in the war . Erdogan president of Syria8217s neighbor Turkey which is also in NATO said on Friday he had spoken by phone with Trump and Putin and told both that increasing tension in the region was not right . Trump himself appeared on Thursday to cast doubt on at least the timing of any USled military action tweeting: "Never said when an attack on Syria would take place could be very soon or not so soon at all at all" Global stock markets have had a whipsaw week largely fueled by Trump's tendency to change his mind over top policy issues fueled by his tendency to changing his mind . UN war crimes investigators condemned on Friday the suspected use of chemical weapons in Douma and called for evidence to be preserved with a view to future prosecutions ASSAD TIGHTENS GRIP . US House Speaker Paul Ryan endorsed Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to be his successor according to an interview with NBC News reported on Friday . Trump has often publicly criticized Comey since firing him but escalated his attacks in response to the book . Comey could be a key witness on that front and could be key witness
---  The United States said on Monday it would expel 60 Russian diplomats joining governments across Europe in punishing the Kremlin for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain that they have blamed on Moscow . It was the strongest action that US President Donald Trump had taken against Russia since coming to office . 18 countries had announced plans to expel Russian officials including 14 European Union countries In total 100 Russian diplomats were being removed the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War . Moscow has denied being behind the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the southern English city of Salisbury . The Kremlin spokesman said the West was making a 8220mistake and that President Vladimir Putin would make a final decision about Russia8217s response . The envoys and their families have been given a week to leave the United States according to one US official . Washington also ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle because of its proximity to a US submarine base and planemaker and defense contractor Boeing Co a senior US official said Seattle was a hub of Russian cyber espionage both political and commercial cyber espionage . Washington had already imposed sanctions on citizens and firms for US election meddling and cyber attacks but put off targeting oligarchs and oligarchs . The White House said  Top Trump administration officials are asking China to cut tariffs on imported cars allow foreign majority ownership of financial services firms and buy more USmade semiconductors . US officials are also working to finalize rules by May instead of the end of June to allow foreign financial groups to take majority stakes in Chinese securities firms .

---  Sanders outlined his vision for how the US should engage with the world today in his most extensive comments on the topic to date . In his speech Sanders criticized US foreign policies past and present He said support for the ongoing Saudi war on Yemen will haunt the US and called the so called global war on terror a disaster Sanders highlighted US backed coups in Iran and Chile as examples of actions that cause incalculable harm . But there were some key omissions from Sanders speech On North Korea Sanders failed to mention the overlooked US role in the crisis that exists today And despite taking a bold stance on the campaign trail in defense of Palestinian rights Sanders didnt mention them in his speech today . Just Foreign Policy is about authorizing a defense budget of some 700 billion dollars including a 50 billion dollar increase passed just last week . The Senate came together by overwhelming numbers I think it was like 89 to 8 or 89 to 9 to pass a massive military spending increase . Sanders is there going after not just Trump but also a bipartisan consensus when it comes to spending so much money on military action overseas . The vote on the President and many of my Republican colleagues want to throw 32 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently have. Meanwhile at the exact same time as Republicans want to .  CNN's John MacInton says it risks feeding a kind of defeatism to say that everyone in Congress is for increasing military spending Therefore theres nothing we can do because the corporations are running it and AARON MATE says that the thing that you should look for are amendments where somebody said Lets cut the thing you really want to know where the fault line was Somebody introducing them and saying Lets cut level of military spending by 1 Look and see how voted on that I only say that not to excuse people for voting in favor of the final bill if you want to slam them for that But I think it risks . Sanders was in a very very very small minority of Democrats who voted against this massive spending increase But he called the Iraq war counterproductive People have a hard time even someone as principled as Sanders having a hard . time just coming out and saying It was illegal and we had no right to invade a foreign country that did nothing to us ROBERT NAIMAN: I agree I agree with every insult I agree. I think its a basic description but okay Its semantics but okay its semantics . I find it amazing that everyone seems to take faith in faith in the US right now it seems impossible inside Washington to take on Russiagate stuff right now

---  Officer Darren Wilson has been cleared by a grand jury and even the brilliance of a thousand bloggers pointing out the glaring inconsistencies in his version of events that August day won't result in a different outcome . Michael Brown's shooting is a kind of racial Rorschach that is not just Brown but all the others from Trayvon Martin to Sean Bell to Patrick Dorismond to Aswan Watson and beyond . That so much of white America cannot see the shapes made out so clearly by most of black America cannot be a mere coincidence nor is it likely an inherent defect in our vision . Rather it is a socially constructed astigmatism that blinds so many to the way in which black folks often experience law enforcement . It is a reflex to rationalize the event defend the shooter trash the dead with blatantly racist rhetoric and imagery . And most of most of the reflex to deny that there is anything about the lens through the lens we are treated by cops and are treated with those shapes by the way we are treating cops by the lens . The most horrific of white cops are often referred to as having their identity matters as being treated by those who do not understand their actions in places like Ferguson as being like Brown or even the latter of which they are treated as being white .  The history of law enforcement in America with regard to black folks has been one of unremitting oppression that is neither hyperbole nor opinion but incontrovertible fact . From slave patrols to overseers to the Black Codes to lynching it is a fact that white people don't know this history have never been required to learn it and can be considered even remotely informed citizens . The inability of white people to hear black reality explains a lot about what's wrong with America, says Roland Martin . The law has been a weapon usedamp160againstamp160black bodies not a shield intended to defend them and for a very long time, he says . In city after city north and south police either stood by or actively participated in pogroms against African American communities in city after cities .

In the 1920s it is estimated that half of black people who had previously dared to move into public housing in public housing killing seventeen and over two dozen members of the early 1960s and early 60s .

Ten years after the start of the financial crisis what was once the province of shady stoners and drug cartels is now a thriving industry with recreational marijuana legal in states ranging from California to Massachusetts . Former Wall Street executives who hail from such staid firms as BlackRock Inc Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Prudential Financial Inc say that they might not have ever left traditional finance if not for the lingering damage of the 2008 crisis . Approximately 250000 people work in the sector and both jobs and revenues are expected to double or triple over the next four years . Despite the growth prospects many financial professionals are still too leery of federal law which considers marijuana an illegal drug to take a job in the industry until there are clear signals from Washington or a change in the makeup of government . The Justice Department reversed a policy from the Obama administration which allowed states to legalize marijuana without fears of a federal crackdown that has had a chilling effect on recruiting within the industry that is keeping the talent away from recruiting . The industry is still largely dominated by black market growers and questionable outfits ruled by blackmarket growers and dealers that are still largely ruled out of the industry by drug cartels and questionable firms to enter the pot sector . There are few reliable numbers on how many former Wall Street professionals who now

---  Deborah LandvikFellner had been eating tuna for 12 years because it didn't exacerbate her Crohn8217s disease . After five years of weird symptoms her husband Mike saw a TV show about a man poisoning his business partner with mercury a potent toxin that can damage the heart nervous system and kidneys . Her blood tests showed 48 parts per billion of mercury nearly 10 times what the Environmental Protection Agency says is safe . The agency recalled nearly 1 million cans of tuna and issued an 8220action level8221 under which fish with more than 05 parts per million ppm of mercury could be pulled from the market . Tuna is the largest source of mercury in the diet because people eat so much of it8221 says Edward Groth a scientist who has written a report on mercury in fish for Oceana and Mercury Policy Project . Americans eat nearly three pounds of canned tuna per capita every year making it the nation's second most popular seafood behind shrimp behind shrimp . The government promotes it via school lunch programs and the federal food program for poor women and children and even in the fda and the Department of Agriculture dietary recommendations it is a staple of lowcarb diets and bodybuilders binge on it . It is the most widely consumed fish in the U.S.  In 2003 the fda did revise the mercury advisory for several kinds of fish but again bent the science to accommodate the industry8217s interests . Canned light represents some 75 percent of the US tuna market the rest is albacore or white tuna which tends to be higher in mercury . The tuna companies launched a 25 million campaign to counteract the advisory with fullpage newspaper ads touting the brainbuilding benefits of omega3 fatty acids 8220Tuna A Smart Catch . The National Fisheries Institute and US Tuna Foundation have waged aggressive and public attacks on people like Marian Burros at the New York Times who earlier this year published a story warning of mercury in sushi tuna and Larry Wheeler at USA Today . The Fisheries Institute says linking high blood mercury levels to any kind of symptoms is an unproven assertion that flies in the face of independent and proven scientific knowledge about canned tuna and all seafood . In response to my specific questions I contacted the Fisheries Institute its spokesman Gavin Gibbons emailed that linking high levels of mercury to any type of symptoms would be irresponsible . In one instance picking up nearly the entire 500,000 cost of a 2005 Harvard Center for Risk Analysis study and using the results to suggest that Americans weren’t eating enough fish is a myth .

---  China8217s top aluminum producer churned out 271 million tonnes of the metal last month up 153 percent from 235 million tonnes in November although it was down 18 percent from a year ago . November output fell 78 percent from October as production cuts of as much as 30 percent at some Chinese aluminum smelters began kicking in fully by the middle of the month as part of a government crackdown on air pollution . The data will likely stir the debate about the government's yearslong push to get rid of excess capacity and could raise tensions with rival producers like the United States and Europe which accuse China of exporting its unwanted metal onto the international market . South Korea's March crude oil imports from Iran dropped 393 percent on slowing demand for Iranian oil in recent months compared to last year's levels despite the Middle Eastern country's efforts to retain its Asian buyers by cutting official selling prices .

---  Equifax is in hot water after one of the largest data breaches in years . Hackers gained access to the personal information of more than 143 million people . Equifax CEO Rick Smith apologized in a video statement . Bill Black is a whitecollar criminologist at the University of Missouri Kansas City and author of THE BEST WAY TO ROB A BANK IS TO OWN ONE . Black says on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the worst that this is a 10 and its almost comically bad . Black was a central figure in exposing Congressional corruption during the Savings and Loan Crisis . He says this is the third major breach in about two years so they had plenty of warning that their security cybersecurity was incompetent and they obviously didnt fix it . Black: Equifax should be not the ones that screwed up instead of the onus that shouldnt be put on us but should be the ones who screwed up. They should not be putting us upreifying us. Thats what much less of us would do if we ran a mom-andpop grocery store as you say in a grocery store. That's what we would do in a mom and pop-up grocery store, that will be commercially valuable to other frauds for 30 years to protect themselves.  Bill Black says the Equifax situation is an example of how abusive these rules are . Equifax has turned this massive abuse into yet another opportunity to make money off the customers who theyre treating in the most atrocious fashion possible . Republicans are trying to gut all of these rules that make it possible for victims to get remedies . The Supreme Court has been very bad on this as well in general upholding arbitration clauses where you have absolutely no ability as a consumer to negotiate Its a takeitorleaveit type deal and it is becoming absolutely pervasive corporate life AARON MATE: This is like a crocodile-like thing that loves to eat humans that eats humans that actually eats what humans eat That is what PR departments are all about what departments are about what they are . They create false fronts about this and make it false front about this. They create it false fronts and have the lizards invade and have these masks on the front of the front and they have the old movie that was on the back of the back and the back . Bill Black: The first thought at Equifax after of course making money by selling stock was How can we compound this abuse how can we make money from Equifax and the first thought was How Can we compound it?

---  Wall Street investment firms are bundling the mortgages on these rental homes into a new financial product known as 8220rentalbacked securities8221 These toxic securities are widely blamed for crashing the global economy in 20072008 All this got me thinking Have private equity firms gambled with rental housing somewhere else before? If so what happened it turns out that the real estate market in my New York City backyard has been a private equity playground for the last decade and the result unsurprisingly has been disaster for tenants and the market alike . Private equity firms like the Blackstone Group believe the money to be made in the housing market lies in snapping up cheap homes in the cities where housing prices crashed most spectacularly . The story of how those private equity players bet so wrong on housing in New York is one that despite the quirks of real estate in the Big Apple is important to understand now that private equity has taken its rental market show on the road nationwide and may soon be coming to a town near you . Back in the early 2000s in the eyes of private equity New York State's comparable corner of the market was 8220affordable housing8221 In hundreds of thousands of apartment units were still designated as rent regulated and landlords prohibited by landlords were prohibited raising the significant way around that were raising the  The descent of private equity firms on the city in the early years of this century was so striking that housing advocates dubbed the practice 8220predatory equity8221 Housing advocates suggest that the aggressive level often employed by private equity players in these years has set the tone for the broader market especially in neighborhoods where the rents are rising fastest . The most infamous case of this type of predatory equity abuse was perpetrated by a real estate company named Ocelot Capital Group in 2007 backed by an Israeli private equity firm it bought 25 rentregulated apartments in the Bronx . The buildings had only sporadic heat or hot water Pipes burst Ceilings caved in and had no working bathroom for more than three months . In February a landlord of a rentregulated building in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick made headlines by hiring construction workers to take sledge hammers into the bathrooms and just start tearing apart his tenants8217 apartments and just started tearing them apart . In 2010 BlackRock Realty and Tishman had already defaulted on the mortgage loans by defaulting on the properties and walked away from the properties . In 2006 BlackRock and Speyer Properties had had to sell off the boiler and pipes in the basement of one of this landlord's other buildings where the boiler was recently destroyed
---  Julian Assange is right to fear for his security in the Ecuadorean embassy in London . Ecuador has reaffirmed its commitment to providing political asylum to Assange . Swedish prosecutors have expressed their intention to question Assange within the embassy something they could have easily done at any time . Sweden is now willing to interview Assange in the embassy why could they have not done this sooner for the sake of the two women involved in the case? A FAQ here explains some of the general circumstances of the case and provides a clear informative summary . The most perplexing aspect of the often hostile public reaction to the plight of Assange is the assumption by so many of benign intent on the part of the US and its close allies the UK and Sweden . Despite all these documented realities perplexing it is indeed that any serious person could assume any benign intent whatsoever. Despite the long documented history of illegal covert operations undertaken by agencies of the United States like COINTELPRO Operation Mockingbird Operation CHAOS and many others despite the quite insane double standards displayed in the 8216intelligence8217 arena, the US establishment has been whipped up on multiple fronts . This is despite many of which strategies reminiscent of the East German Stasi have been laid out for the world of the U.S.  This is pseudojournalism in that it does not challenge power or hold it to account . It merely discusses topics of current interest within a neoliberal framework that is never questioned . On rare occasions more radical voices do reach the mainstream they are habitually smeared or simply sidelined .

---  Last week the US suspended almost 200 million in aid and reduced another 96 million to Egypt . Egyptian government announced that it was going to cancel a meeting with Jared Kushner who is President Trumps soninlaw who is also the special envoy for the Middle East peace talks . President Sisi ratified the law that was passed by the Egyptian Parliament about six months ago or seven months ago and I think he did that because he assumed that the American administration is not going to criticize him for this The reason being he waited over six months because of the criticisms that came from Europe and other places but after he met with President Trump there was some miscalculation it seems . The Egyptian government has been very sensitive to this since Mubaraks time because any foreign aid supported organization they assume will be implementing a foreign agenda and its NGOs do what NGOs do according to them So its not really human rights violations here as much as its a question of foreign policy regarding North Korea and the second issue is the role of the nongovernmental organizations in Egypt And I think the State Department is the concern that the state Department has mainly from the point of view of the Egyptian government . The relationship between Egypt and North Korea is really a strong and there has been serious miscalculculation  President Trump announced very early on that foreign aid will be cut overall except for Israel and Egypt and Egypt . Egypt is the second largest recipient of US aid in the world . The State Department is reducing the overall aid by 96 million and is freezing 200 million pending the Egyptian change of behavior regarding the NGOs . President Sisi ratified the new law that regulates the workings of civil society organizations and NGOs . Some members in the Senate and in the Congress did not like the new Egyptian law . The reduction basically the first and I think this is related to the law that we mentioned Law 70 regarding the NGO The first discussion or the first recommendation for reduction came from the Senate Appropriations Committee back in May I guess in May . In their meeting in May they invited three experts and basically they recommended reducing the economic aid part from 150 million to 112 million . The freezing of the 200 million is conditional based on Egyptians behavior. would the NGOs adapt to the new Egypt law . But the problems of Egypt cannot really be solved or even cannot be helped by the aid . And in that sense that could be that could . be helped to . help us give us a sense of this action on the U.S. AndPalestine peace talks also give us an insight into how the action on

The suspected chemical attack on April 7 killed dozens of people in Douma medical relief organizations say It led to the rebel group that controlled Douma agreeing to surrender control of the town to the Syrian government . South Korea said on Wednesday it is considering how to change a decadesold armistice with North Korea into a peace agreement as US officials confirmed an unprecedented toplevel meeting with the North Korean leader . US Secretary of State nominee and CIA Director Mike Pompeo became the most senior US official known to have met North Korea leader Kim Jong Un when he visited Pyongyang at the end of March to discuss a planned summit with US President Donald Trump .

There were 144 passengers and five crew members aboard the flight . One passenger was taken to a hospital in critical condition and seven people treated for minor injuries at the scene at Philadelphia Airport . The aircraft had been inspected as recently as Sunday according to Southwests Kelly who confirmed that Tuesdays fatality is the first of its kind in the carriers 51year history .

The next year after Franco and his allies made their grab for power however the Texaco CEO suddenly changed course and bet on them .

---  British had no alternative but to take military action to degrade Syria8217s chemical weapons capability Prime Minister Theresa May said the missile strike designed to minimize civilian casualties was aimed at deterring further use of chemical weapons and was not an attempt to topple the Syrian government . Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the mission had been highly successful and implied that no further action was imminent . Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn a fervent antiwar campaigner called the strikes 8220legally questionable8221 and said May should have recalled parliament from a holiday . May dispensed with a nonbinding constitutional convention dating back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq She said speed was essential and that military action was in the national interest .

The combined US and French assault appeared more intense than a similar attack on a similar Syrian air base in Hmeimim . The strike appears more intense and intense than the previous USled assault than the similar attack . The Syrian conflict pits a complex myriad of parties against each other with Russia, Iran and Iran giving Assad military and Iran military help that has largely proven decisive over the past three years in crushing any rebel threat to topple him Fractured opposition forces .

---  The Trump administration and a Republicanheld Congress appear poised to unravel the nation8217s bedrock environmental laws and programs including the Endangered Species Act ESA amp160 The ESA is one of our most effective environmental laws proven to be vital to protecting species such as the iconic grizzly bear . Last Congress over 200 bills were introduced that would have undermined the ESA . A similar torrent is expected this Congress to strip protections for wolves in the Great Lakes and Wyoming have already been reintroduced . A terrible precedent would be set by allowing Congressmen to circumvent the Act in the service of their cronies . This has already happened once with wolves in Montana and Idaho which were delisted by regressive Congressmen in 2011 If it happens again no endangered species will be safe from congressional shenanigans . 99 of 99 of the species granted protection under the ESA have so far survived and a growing number of growing number have survived . The ESA requires that the management of species be based solely on the best available science not the conveniences of bureaucrats and politicians . The Act also includes a provision allowing conservationists to sue those who are often lax in enforcing the Act to play a role in enforcing their own interests . A number of species listed as endangered since 1983 has also been required to designate 8220critical habitat  ESA opponents have an ardent champion in Rep Rob Bishop RUT who recently vowed to repeal and replace the law . Opponents are driven by basic ideology rather than real economic problems with implementation of the Act . ESA opponents also make much of the fact that less than 50 out of 1600 listed species have been delisted because they had been recovered . The FWS tends to be its own worst enemy in trying to placate hostile states or industries that will never be content with any protective measures . FWS8217 tendency to view ESA successes as only those that have led to species being delisted 8211 not species that have stabilized because of actions taken under the Act This puts undue emphasis on delisting decisions and creates unnecessary controversy Indeed the FWS tend to be itself worst enemy In fact many legal victories are won by conservationists because conservationists . Wyoming congressmen are trying to circumvent the Act and delist wolves legislatively rather than demanding that Wyoming fix its problem in the first place Now rather than demanded that Wyoming should have required a more rational 8212 and legal 8212 state plan in first place . There are distorted views about the costs and benefits of recovering species8230 Costs and Benefits of Recovering Species and the benefits are correspondingly shortchanged These include tourism and the

US Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday it would order the inspection of some CFM jet engines after investigators said a broken fan blade touched off an engine explosion on a Southwest Airlines flight shattering a window and killing a passenger . It was the first death in a US commercial aviation accident since 2009 . In August 2016 a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Florida after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a footlong hole above the left wing . Investigators found signs of metal fatigue . The blades which sweep air backwards to help provide thrust can be changed and repaired independently of the rest of the engine meaning airlines that dont keep tabs have to examine more engines than anticipated which adds time and cost . The maintenance burden and cost for operators to inspect all effective fan blades is much more significant than proposed it said United Continental Holdings Inc made a similar argument to the FAA and its European counterpart proposed checks last year for potentially flawed fan blades . Other airlines commenting on last years FAA proposal projected higher costs in time and money than regulators initially expected because they did not closely track the fan blade .

---  US President Donald Trump heads to the region this week for a summit that diplomats say is likely to be awkward and tense . Diplomats say the visit is stirring nostalgia for Obama the Republican president8217s Democratic predecessor a Peruvian diplomat said . Trump has disparaged Latin American countries over immigration narcotics and trade . He is going in profoundly unpopular in the region and that obviously complicates the ability of leaders to work with him8221 said Mark Feierstein who managed hemispheric issues for President Barack Obama 8217s White House and is now an adviser with the Albright Stonebridge Group . The White House also wants to turn up regional pressure on Venezuela 8220s socialist president Nicolas Maduro disinvited from the summit who called an election for May that his opposition and Washington have cast as a sham . The United States a major buyer of Venezuelan oil has weighed ramping up economic sanctions A US official told reporters last week that no decisions were imminent but could be made in the next several several months over the next few several weeks . The U.S. Foreign Ministry may formally condemn the Venezuelan election and discuss ways to help migrants over a statement to help Venezuelan migrants according to a source at Argentina's Foreign Ministry Suchprecedented statement would be 8220unprecedented  Syrian state TV said there had been casualties in what it said was a suspected US missile attack on the T4 airfield near Homs close to the ancient city of Palmyra in central Syria . Israel has struck Syrian army locations many times in the course of the conflict hitting convoys and bases of Iranianbacked militias that fight alongside Assad8217s forces . The Pentagon denied US war planes were carrying out any air strikes in Syria at the present time 8220 . The Syrian opposition blamed the suspected chemical attack on Saturday in Douma on government forces as international officials worked to try to confirm the chemical attack .

The White House said evidence pointed to the use of chemical weapons was that chemical weapons were used The UN Security Council will meet twice on Monday following UN war crimes investigators had previously documented 33 chemical attacks in Syria and the United Nations investigators had documented 33 such attacks
---  Syrian revolutionaries are the political and moral descendants of the brigades that took up arms against Franco in the name of democracy and social justice . The type of solidarity that the left offered to Spain8217s freedom fighters 80 years ago is sorely missing today a result of much of the left seeing revolutionary Syrians as jihadist stereotypes refracted through an Orientalist lens rather than as fleshandblood human beings . I am afraid that it is too late for the leftists in the West to express any solidarity with the Syrians in their extremely hard struggle . Mainstream Western leftists know almost nothing about Syria its society its society, regime its regime its people its political economy its history and contemporary history . Syria is only an additional occasion for their old antiimperialist tirades never the living subject of the debate, says the author of Burning Country . The left made a terrible mistake by repudiating the men and women who rose up against Assad, he says . The average salary for example is less than 6000 lire about 115 per month and most families have at least five people have at most modest expenses like food on the table and rent on the most modest expense like rent and rent . In some ways it is the same political and intellectual failure in Stalin8217’s day  In the early days of the revolution a grass roots democracy developed that was just as deserving of the left as the Kurdishcontrolled Rojova . The fruit of such efforts were the LCCs or Local Coordination Committees that were organized horizontally in a fashion that won many anarchists to the cause of the Syrian revolution . CounterPunch has published one hundred articles on Syria but there is only one that refers to the Lccs in any detail . The LCC's rejected sectarianism and remained committed to nonviolent resistance . They called general strikes on a number of occasions just as the trade unions have done in Greece but at much greater risk . In retaliation the regime carried out mass arrests and burned businesses closed in honor of the actions during one strike a hundred shops were damaged in Deraa alone . In two months following a strike Assad closed 187 factories and laid off 85000 workers according to official figures . The same thing goes under the former FSL would be the same under former Fteed canal that environmentalists consider a looming catastrophe for the late late-N guerrilla Daniel Chinesed Canal that would be a looming disaster for peasants and peasants . In the late 1980s, Vilas Vilas spoke to a radical sociologist named Carlos Vilas . Vilas said Vilas
---  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and incoming chief of the New York Fed on Friday sketching a picture of gradual interestrate hikes ahead . Powell merely said it was too soon to know if the trade issue would take a toll on the US economy which has been steadily strengthening . San Francisco Fed President John Williams said that although the rhetoric on tariffs so far has been more extreme than the actions taken he loses sleep over the prospect of an actual trade war which he warned could result in slower growth an inflationary spike and lower productivity . The remarks by the two came as the United States and China exchanged new threats on the trade front . China warned on Friday it was fully prepared to respond with a 8220fierce counter strike8221 of fresh measures if the U.S. follows through on President Donald Trump8217s threat to slap tariffs on an additional 100 billion of Chinese goods . China as of the end of January held around 17 trillion of Treasuries making it the No 2 overall owner of US government bonds after the Federal Reserve . The Labor Department reported the unemployment rate held steady at 41 percent for a sixth straight month in March as 103,000 jobs were created the lowest amount in six months . The Fed has been slowly raising interest rates since March when  Motiva wants to add an ethane cracker near its refinery that could produce more than 15 million tons of ethylene a year the sources said Saturday . Motiva will also include an agreement with TechnipFMC FTIN for a study of producing materials used in gasoline and industrial solvents Bloomberg News reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter Motiva Chief Executive Brian Coffman last month said the company had yet to win approval for its major expansion projects . Exxon is separately proposing to build with another Aramco unit Saudi Basic Industries Corp 2010SE a 9 billion petrochemical plant near Corpus Christi that would process ethane . The dueling trade threats rattled Wall Street on Friday ending a volatile week with major indexes closing down more than 2 percent on the day The dollar also fell while safe havens such as the Japanese Yen and gold futures futures rose . The week started with China imposing 3 billion of tariffs on US fruits nuts wine and pork and rapidly escalated to threats that could seriously curtail hundreds of billions of dollars of dollars in trade between the world8217s two largest economies China and U.S. President Donald Trump defended his proposed tariffs saying the move might cause a little pain but the United States would be better off in the long run .
---  The Pentagon has committed itself and the nation to a threefront geopolitical struggle to resist Chinese and Russian advances in Asia Europe and the Middle East . Think of it as the most momentous military planning on Earth right now Who8217s even paying attention given the eternal changing of the guard? And yet it increasingly looks as if thanks to current Pentagon planning a twentyfirstcentury version of the Cold War with dangerous new twists has begun and hardly anyone has even noticed . The reason is simple enough The screaming headline you should have seen in any paper is this the US military has made up its mind about the future . The New Geopolitical Chessboard will require greater spending on costly military hardware but also a redrawing of the strategic map to favor the regular military . Unsurprisingly enough this shift will not only require the regular map of the global map of global boundaries given the regular geographic map to favour the regular war and the regular terror boundaries . The shift will also require greater geographic boundaries given less geography and less geographic boundaries and less geography given the long war on long war and boundaries on long terror boundaries and more geographic boundaries to favor regular war on regular terror and less geographical boundaries and the special operations forces . The US military is also given less geographic and strategic boundaries .  The Pentagon8217s perspective this is to be the defining strategic global map for the foreseeable future Expect most upcoming major military investments and initiatives to focus on bolstering US naval air and ground strength on its side of these lines as well as on targeting SinoRussian vulnerabilities across them . The senior commanders of these metaorganizations are the most powerful US officials in their 8220areas of responsibility8221 AORs exercising far more clout than any American ambassador stationed in the region and often local heads of state as well . The IndoPacific Front Commanding PACOM is Admiral Harry Harris Jr a longtime naval aviator . In his annual posture statement delivered to the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 15th Harris painted a grim picture of America's strategic position in the AsiaPacific region . Harris called for vastly increasing investment in such weaponry in order to overpower current and future Chinese capabilities and ensure US military dominance of China . He also hinted that he wouldn8217t mind having new nucleararmed missiles for this purpose . He suggested that could be launched from ships and planes and so would skirt the IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces Treaty to which the US is a signatory and which bans landbased intermediaterange nuclear missiles . He spoke with great enthusiasm about new generations of aircraft and missiles
---  Rutanya Alda is author of 8221 The Mommie Dearest Diary Carol Ann Tells All8221 . She talks about working with Faye Dunaway in her new book . Alda says she tried to be fair in her book and I hope when Faye reads it she can respect the fact that I was fair to her 8230 It's very hard to be with a person on the set who is totally ungiving to the other actor I just held my tongue then because as you know from the book she never stayed for any of my closeups I stayed for hers to the 12th the 13th hour and she never turned around and stayed for . any of mine It8217s really not honoring the other actors and we have to honor that We8217re a team workingamp160together for the best of the scene I always felt Faye worked for herself only . The audience of 8220Mommy Dearest8221 is a great audience and I think they are disappointed that Faye has never embraced the film If I were Faye . I would have said 8220Look I was great in the part I did great things OK maybe I had an overthetop performance but it worked didn't it8221  Joan mistook you for Mia Farrow when she was to stand on 8220Mommie Dearest. was camp when you read the script8221 I said 8220No8221 He knew right away but they edited like an hour and a half out of that movie anyway . Faye's filmography is quite spotty after that and there was never another 8220Network8221 or 8220Chinatown8221caliber film after it . Joan was a wonderful actress for that era She was over the top and mannered but that was the movies of that era I think she was marvelous in those kinds of movies People don8217t act that way today but they8217re fascinating to watch You look at 8220Baby Jane8221 and even some of the horror movies she did and she was really pretty impressive I just thought she and Bette were really over-the-top but it works What two actresses today could do that style in that kind of way and make it so memorable and unique and make a difference to the movies today? Faye and I thought she was just standing there either she or Bette or she knew who she was a star for 50 years and she radiated and there were something that just radiated
---  Francis8217 Encyclical 8220 On Care for Our Common Home8221 recognizes the incredible damage being done to climate change and biodiversity . Francis unequivocally recognizes the science of climate change . Francis could call for a renewed emphasis on not eating red meat on Fridays . He could recommend that Catholics not eat any meat including foul and fish on Mondays . This would be a bold step going beyond reemphasizing what is already Catholic doctrine yet it would be consistent with the belief that the world has a 8220sickness evident in the world's climate . Francis clearly understands that the extent of environmental crises goes beyond his own church when he says 8220I wish to address every person living on this planet8221 . Francis affirms the 8220an urgent need to develop policies8221 to address climate change 26. He could ask governments to ensure that those who receive their livelihood from the livestock sector are protected from harm by decreased consumption of meat . The Pope could ask religious leaders throughout the world to consider a day without red meat . Francis is hopeful when he said 8220Outside the Catholic Church other Churches and Christian communities 8211 and other religions as well have expressed deep concern and offered valuable reflections on issues which all of us find disturbing and offer valuable reflections  Francis could ask other religious leaders to step outside of their roles established hundreds or thousands of years ago to recognize the profound threat to Life on Earth . A debate between the world8217s 12 million Catholics would not be ignored by other religions . Francis could precaution the world against using vegetarianism as a weapon of cultural domination . Non Brahmin Indians resent attempts to ban eating beef when India is a major exporter of water buffalo meat which is not considered sacred by upper castes . Indians who do eat meat eat far less than do Americans and American Cowboys . The issue is how to present a change away from overconsumption of meat without devaluing their culture or creating massive unemployment . Not eating red meat for three days a week no meat of any kind for two days and no animal products one day a week would transform the concept of 8220doing without to preserve our common home 8 Francis could recommend that Catholics eat no animal flesh or animal products including eggs milk and cheese on Wednesdays . The tradition of not eating meat on Fridays comes with the idea of doing without something for Lent comes with idea of do without something on Lent .

---  Weapons inspectors will try on Saturday to reach the site of a suspected poison attack in the Syrian town of Douma hours after Western countries launched air strikes in retaliation over the gassing . The OPCW will determine whether chemical weapons were used but will not assign blame for any such attack . Washington says it has confirmed that chlorine gas was used and has unconfirmed suspicion that nerve agents may also have been used . The strikes are punishment for killing dozens of people many of them women and children with banned toxic munitions . Damascus and its ally Russia have denounced the Western action in particular for refusing to wait until the results of the factfinding mission sent by the OPCw in the wake of the April 7 incident . Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons arsenal in 2013 and submit to inspections . The bombing represents a major escalation in the West8217s confrontation with Russia but is unlikely to alter the course of a multisided war which has killed at least half a million people in the past seven years but is not likely to alter course of course of war which is at once at once both reckless and pointless . Syria has been unable to explain several findings by inspectors including undeclared research and development sites the presence of banned chemicals and missing munitions sources have told Reuters  Western countries have all said for seven years that Assad must leave power they held back in the past from striking his government lacking a wider strategy to defeat him Assad8217s government and allies responded outwardly with fury to Saturday's attack but also made clear that they considered it a oneoff unlikely to harm Assad in any meaningful way . Western intervention appears to have virtually no chance of altering the military balance of power at a time when Assad is in his strongest position since the war . Western powers were at pains to avert any further escalation including any unexpected conflict with their superpower rival French Defense Minister Florence Parly said the Russians 8220were warned beforehand to avert conflict . Syria agreed in 2013 to give up its chemical weapons after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Douma . But a US official familiar with the military planning said there could be more air strikes if the intelligence indicates Assad has not stopped making importing storing or using chemical weapons including chlorine . The global chemical weapons watchdog the OPCW has sent a team to assess last week's suspected gas attack was inconclusive he said . Syrian state media called the attack a 8220flagrant violation of international law and said it would cause consequences against US interests against U.S. interests against Iran . The US
---  US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis praised Vietnam for adhering to sanctions against North Korea saying its leadership on the issue came despite the costs associated with lost trade . US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last week that the United States was getting evidence that sanctions were 8220really starting to hurt8221 North Korea although there are no signs yet that they have altered Pyongyang8217s military calculus . Vietnam and North Korea at one time both within the influence of the former Soviet Union maintain traditional diplomatic and political ties . Relations have been tested in recent years particularly following the alleged involvement of a Vietnamese citizen in the murder of Kim Jong Un's half brother in 2017 . US Defense Department office in Hanoi sits just across the street from the North Korean embassy and seeks to recover the remains of US troops killed in the 196575 Vietnam War . Some 1293 US forces are still unaccounted for one US official said Mattis8217 trip comes amid steadily strengthening USVietnamese ties including between their two militaries as both countries seek to put the Vietnam War firmly behind them . Relations these days are seen largely through shared concern over China's aggressive behavior in the South China Sea where more than 3 trillion in cargo passes every year Vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponent of China  Israel for the first time admitted that it bombed a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007 . The military released previously classified cockpit footage and intelligence documents about its Sept 6 2007 air strike on the AlKubar facility near Deir alZor in eastern Syria It said the reactor was being constructed with help from North Korea and had been months away from activation Amos Yadlin Israel8217s military intelligence chief at the time said even with a functioning reactor it would have taken Syria years to build a nuclear weapon . Israel's decision to go public comes after repeated calls in recent months by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the U.S. and international community to take tougher action on Iran . China announced that a former ambassador to the United Nations Liu Jieyi has been appointed head of China8217's Taiwan Affairs Office . Liu has been deputy head of the office since October last year and is committed to ensuring peace and maintaining the status quo and committed to maintaining peace in the peace with the island . The event was first made public by Syria which said it was a signatory of the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty NPT has always denied that the site was engaged in cooperation with Damascus in the 1970s nuclear reactor or pro-nuclear activity was a part of the 1980s
---  Hundreds of thousands of Americans galvanized by last month8217s Florida school massacre rallied on Saturday at nationwide March For Our Lives protests led by students demanding tighter gun laws .

---  In late 2009 environmental justice activists in New York State began to build a very large grassroots movement and an impressive coalition of over 70 groups calling for a ban on a particularly destructive method of methane mining called horizontal hydrofracking or 8216fracking . Fracking is a water and energyintensive form of drilling for 8216natural gas8217 and is used to force nearly impermeable geological formations like tight sands and shales to yield methane gas trapped in tiny pores . Josh Fox chronicles his crosscountry odyssey searching for answers about the impacts of gas drilling while failing to support or even refer to the existence of this or any other campaign to ban gas drilling . Yet in his film Gasland we need to explore how people came to learn about the threat of horizontal hydraulic fracturing to their way of life the environment and public helath and to recognize the various responses to that threat by communities directly threatened professional environmentalists politicians politicians and finally the artist . In this review of the film this review will touch on why are Josh Fox and his film becoming famous and why are Gasland becoming famous? We need to address this question to answer why are the film being made famous? This review of this review we will touch upon why are he becoming famous for Gasland .  A moratorium on such hydrofracking instituted by New York Governor Paterson would stay in place and that the DGEIS was not the appropriate vehicle for reviewing flaws in any proposed regulatory scheme . A push at the State government level for a oneyear moratorium on gas drilling in New York State recently passed the New York state Senate and may be headed to the New . Statewide ban advocates have tried unsuccessfully to determine how the sponsoring legislators for the moratorium efforts decided to introduce moratorium bills as opposed to a ban bill in light of the already strong movement for a ban . Many advocates for the ban believe that the timing of a moratorium plays into the hands of the gas industry while pointing out that declaring what activists and upstate . communities want 8216unrealistic8217 is a selffulfilling prophecy because it stifles those demanding urgently needed transitions away from polluting energy sources while insulating politicians from the true demands of their constituents . The FRAC Act would protect all of our . constituents while ignoring those demanding the true needs of their . constituents . A moratorium not only delays the ban effort but also serves the gas drilling industry because of the moratorium may become more attractive according to the industry itself . Some of the . industry itself because some shale plays .

Big Chief Harrison figures in the coda to Ned Sublette8217s new book 8220The World That Made New Orleans From Spanish Silver to Congo Square . Sublette writes of Harrison and his fellow chiefs in their elaborate beaded and feathered suits during . the first Mardi . Gras following Hurricane Katrina . Following Hurricane Katrina the city that author Sublette calls 8220an alternative American history all in itself .

---  The United States government has initiated a chain reaction that it can no longer control in Iraq . Once brown people start to pick up guns other brown people follow suit, he says . The myth of invincibility of the U.S. military is called into question even before the Bush Doctrine arrived at this particular Iraqi culdesac 8212 is shattered. Apache helicopters are buzzsawing through neighborhoods with chain guns and rockets . The author says people with guns should be taken seriously and people who have lived with guns with guns are seriously taken seriously . Some of us are not bothered to be bothered and some are not going bothered . We have to build a bridge from the scene of crimes and crimes and that is made with the backs of soldiers with guns . Some are going to be made with guns, he writes. The soldier must pay seriously and that they are not bothering to be taken serious and that we have to be taking seriously. Some are not gone to be gone to the scenes of the crime of Columbine and Columbine in Columbine. We can’t be bothered. When the guerrilla picks up the gun the imperial soldier picks up a gun of violence. When an alienated teenager picks up an imperial soldier. We must pay the gun  A young woman I met recently was surprised by her own first encounter with several soldiers . She recognized that social transformation is neither painless nor bloodless and she has no illusions about that . Liberals have never learned this, she says . The cruelty to which these soldiers have been inured has the potential to be turned against hypocrisy then against the system . The imperial soldier is constrained by the superstitions of patriotism and the soldier becomes a danger to power when he recognizes the speciousness of patriotism . For Iraq it is the only tactic and the armed resistance in Iraq 8212 is doing more to halt the runaway train that is global capitalism than anything else in the world right now . We cannot imagine the sheer joy of rediscovery being felt throughout the region right now as people see these fighters striking back at the source of their long humiliation . We have seen ourselves as corpses Politics doesn’t happen in clean welllighted places It happens in the sand and mud, it happens in a well-lighted place and the rivulets of blood coursing into an Iraqi hospital floor It happened in the head of some unnamed Marine or Green Beret or tank gunner who is looking out over the truth of the imperial landscape in Sadr City or Fallujah
---  Names bestow meaning when it comes to war a name can shape our understanding of what the conflict was all about . To specify when a war began and when it ended is to privilege certain explanations of its significance while discrediting others . Americans today characterize the horrendous fraternal bloodletting of 18611865 as the Civil War Yet not many decades ago diehard supporters of the Lost Cause insisted on referring to that conflict as the War Between the States or the War for Southern Independence or even the War of Northern Aggression . Europeans once referred to the calamitous events of 19141918 as the Great War When Woodrow Wilson decided in 1917 to send an army of doughboys to fight alongside the Allies he went beyond Great According to the president the 'Great War was going to be the War To End All Wars' But things did not pan out as he expected . The World War II accurately capture the events it purports to encompass . The period of WWII is not especially misleading and not especially useful The period is only a useful and convenient and convenient World War I is no more convenient and useful World of the World Series8221 than World of World of Baseball or World of The World Series or the World of America or World Of America or the Cold War .  It matters what we choose to name the military enterprise we8217ve been waging not only in Iraq and Afghanistan but also in any number of other countries scattered across the Islamic world . Washington seems in no hurry to name its nameless war8212and will no doubt settle on something selfserving or anodyne if it ever finally addresses the issue . Let8217s consider some possible options names that might actually explain what's going on The Long War Coined not long after 911 by senior officers in the Pentagon this formulation never gained traction with either civilian officials or the general public Yet the Long War deserves consideration even though though8212or perhaps because8212it has lost its luster with the passage of time . The War Against Al Qaeda Coined never gained any traction with civilian officials, but it does succinctly capture the experience of U.S. soldiers who have endured multiple combat deployments to Iraq and . Afghanistan . For Long War combatants the object of the exercise has become to persist As for winning it 8220long8221 lost its original connotation . The Long . War may conclude by the end of 2014 if President Obama keeps his pledge to end the US combat role in Afghanistan and if he avoids getting sucked into Syria8217’s civil war

---  US soybean growers are losing market share in the allimportant China market because the race to grow higheryielding crops has robbed their most prized nutrient protein . The problem is a key factor driving soybean buyers from the US to Brazil where warmer weather helps offset the impact of higher crop yields on protein levels . Soybeans are by far the most valuable US agricultural export with 228 billion in shipments in 2016 . The industry group will spend 56 million in fiscal year 2018 on research and other efforts to boost protein up from 37 million last year . Soybean industry also faces rising competition from a growing number of synthetic and organic alternative feeds that provide more protein for less money . The protein decline coincides with a rise of cheaper and more abundant alternative feeds available to livestock and poultry producers . But the industry's response has yet to take on much urgency because many agribusiness giants that develop seed technology such as Monsanto Co and DowDuPont Inc have little incentive to focus on raising protein levels like Monsanto Co have little incentives to raise protein levels and have little motivation to focus their efforts to do so . Brazil growers retain an edge in protein thanks to warmer weather and longer days days and longer weather and warmer weather . Brazil soybeans contain 37 percent soybeans and have also seen  Norwegian oil company Statoil plans to change its name to Equinor reflecting commitment to become a broad energy company rather than one focused only on oil it said on Thursday . The proposal will be put to the annual general meeting on May 15 but Statoil said it already had the backing of the Norwegian state which has a 67 percent stake in the company . Rebranding would cost up to 250 million Norwegian crowns 325 million he later told a news conference . Statoil is headquartered in the port city and oil industry hub of Stavanger has come to symbolize Norway's rise in the past halfcentury to one of the world's richest nations . The switch is a way to show its determination to develop investments in renewable energy . The company said it expects to invest 1520 percent of capital spending by 2030 in what it calls new energy solutions up from about 5 percent last year in what they call new energy Solutions .

---  The Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Whole Womans Health v Hellerstedt on March 2 The case involves a Texas abortion law that requires abortion doctors to be affiliated with nearby hospitals and limits abortion to ambulatory surgical centers . Prochoice advocates and major medical groups say the law will not enhance patient safety and will only reduce womens access to abortion . The challenge is seen as a landmark case that could shape abortion rules for years to come . It could also affect dozens of other regulations of disputed medical value that have been adopted by numerous states including limits on nonsurgical druginduced abortions mandated building standards for clinics and twoday or threeday waiting periods . The case is not only the future of abortion access in Texas and in the nine other states that like Alabama and Louisiana have adopted similar physician rules but it could also affects dozens of more regulations of other states including building standards . Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller was asked why the state of Texas needed to change its regulation of abortion clinics to which he replied that HB 2 was passed in the wake of the Kermit Gosnell scandal in order to improve patient safety in abortion care . As Justices Kagan and Ginsburg explained however the case was actually an example of Pennsylvanias failure to regularly inspect  The US Supreme Court will hear a full hour of oral argument Wednesday on the biggest abortion case in a quarter century . The case Whole Womans Health v Hellerstedt arises from a Texas law requiring that abortionists have hospital medical staff privileges within 30 miles of the abortion and also that abortion clinics comply with the same standards as ambulatory surgery centers . Phyllis Schlafly founder of the conservative Eagle Forum claimed that HB 2 will ensure that there is never against another Kermit Gosnell . Abortion supporters claim that this good law has forced about half of Texas 40 abortion clinics to close and that even more may close if the Supreme Court does not rule in their favor . Fox News senior managing editor Manny Alvarez claimed that Gosnells crimes were a reason for the state to address its needs and construct more regulated safe facilities through the Texas law . FoxNewscom 62915 Fox News America hosted Fox contributors Kirsten Powers and Monica Crowley to discuss the failure of the Texas legislature to pass the earlier version of HB 2 on the June 26 June 26 2013 edition of Fox News News America to discuss HB 2 and said it was completely reasonable and that some of the women who died would have met some of these requirements without licenses without Gosnell had met these requirements .

Critics of the administration called the unusually large lease sale illtimed US crude oil and natural gas output is already smashing records thanks to improved drilling technology that has opened up cheaper onshore reservoirs and Brazil and Mexico are also competing for drilling investment in their own deepwater acreage often with better terms .

---  Madoff as often said in the media these days these days made steady annual returns 8212 on which one paid ordinary income taxes not capital gains taxes . But on an annual basis Madoff didn8217t lose money which was a major plus . The idea that Madoff made money every month however is misleading . Madoff's monthly variations made the whole deal look Kosher at least to an amateur as did the variations in annual returns . The whistle had been blown on Madoff at least as far back as 1999 or 2000 when an investment professional named Harry Markopolos who had operated with derivatives had sometimes used the splitstrike conversion strategy and was mathematically expert had informed the SEC both orally and in a memo of reasons why his operation could not possibly be on the up and up . Markopolo gave reason after reason why Madoffs operation could possibly be a fraud . The 2005 version of the memo will soon be available at Velvelonnationalnationalcomcom.com The memo to be released at VelVelon national national website . The original version of this article had been written in 2001 for a hedge fund publication called MARHedge Edge magazine RIP by a reporter named Michael Ocrant . This was an article that was published in 2001 by a  After December 11th however the media began covering Madoff8217s scheme including the red flags called to the attention of the SEC by Markopolos . The SEC apparently checked out none of this however so the average investor was again left completely in the dark . The options market was not nearly big enough to support the number of puts and calls necessary for the volume of trading in stocks that Madoff claimed to be doing . The growth in the amount of money Madoff was managing was all news to me after the scandal struck . Hedge funds who invested with him for example were not allowed to mention his name in their marketing materials . The use of leverage is very dangerous because the market goes down with three to one dollars invested for every four investment is wiped out if the investment drops down with one to one of your equity which is wiped . Madoff also used leverage of one dollar . The investment dropped 25 percent to one percent if the market drops down if the investor drops out . The investor lost 25 percent of investment drops out of 25 percent when the investment dropped out of the investment . If the investor loses out of their equity which one dollar drops to one dollar is wiped down with the investment which is wiping out the investor out of one . The average investor is wiped
---  Lawrence Wilkerson who served as Colin Powell8217s chief of staff said Israeli warnings against an attack on Iraq were 8220pervasive in Israeli communications with the administration during early 2002 . Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said in his memoir The Age of Turbulence that he had feared that Saddam Hussein would acquire a nuclear weapon that this would give him control over the Strait of Hormuz and that he therefore had to be removed . Greenspan also said he believed the size of the threat Saddam posed Saddam posed was scary because it could have essentially shut down a significant economic activity throughout the world . The logic here is that whatever economic genius or political analysis does not extend to military strategizing or strategizing . At least one wonders how exactly does exactly for instance that Saddam could have controlled the strait with a nuclear or any other type of type of nuclear or type of weapon . One wonders why Saddam does not raise the question of why given his knowledge of Saddam and why he does not have any significance of any significance for the instance of any type of . instance of . Saddam could close it up to the question for instance when Iraq does not know how exactly do not extend for instance for instance . The question does not even extend to political analysis  Both Greenspan8217s and Wilkerson8217 statements seem to let Israel and its US lobbyists off the hook something that in differing ways serves the interests of Israel and the lobby of the right in the US and of the left . The US political right does not of course want to acknowledge that the relationship with Israel has grown so close that the US would actually go to war at the behest of or for the benefit of Israel . The left on the other hand very much wants to believe that oil and perhaps secondarily the imperial drive constituted the only motivations and that Israel played no role at all . The weight of public discourse since before the Iraq war was launched has been that any Israeli role in inspiring or pushing for it is at best a silly invention and at worst a vile antiJewish lie . The thought that the tail might wag the dog is rarely taken seriously so the left is as skittish as anyone and perhaps more so than anyone else about being seen to criticize Israel except occasionally regarding the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories . Chris Hedges says that the left believes that Israel is a hapless tool of Washington and Israel is at least a tool of the U.S. The left is much more comfortable for the US is evil and Israel

---  The big Afghanistan debate in Washington is not over whether more troops are needed but just who they should be Americans or Afghans . Afghans do not think or act like Americans yet yet Americans in power refuse to grasp that inconvenient point . Afghan recruits come from a world of desperate poverty and malnourished and underweight . U.S. military planners and policymakers already proceed as if with sufficient training Afghans can be transformed into scalemodel windup American Marines . That is not going to happen Not now Not ever. No matter how many of our leaders concur that it must happen 8212 and ever faster .

A growing body of research points to the lingering effects of trauma on children when no one helps them to cope with the emotional aftermath children can become angry irritable and aggressive in response to the stress of violence . CPS has embarked on a massive training of social workers and schoolbased counselors in how to conduct group therapy for children who have experienced trauma . The therapy program is called Cognitive Behavioral for Trauma in Schools known as CBITS pronounced 8220seebits8221 . The approach was developed by children in Los Angeles who were exposed to violence and was effective with children who were found to be effective with Hurricane Katrina and was successful with those who lived through Hurricane Katrina . CPS officials want to see it used widely used to curb problems and reduce suspensions and expulsions and ultimately raise achievement problems .

---  In 1968 Amory Bradford penned a volume entitled Oakland8217s Not For Burning documenting the tinderbox that the city had become and lamenting the inevitability with which it would explode . Forty years later in the early hours of this year of ostensible hope the reality of the persistence of racism in Oakland became devastatingly clear sparking a powerful response the likes of which this city hasn8217t seen in years . BART police detained the train at the Fruitvale station forcibly removing several young men from the train as dozens of bystanders watched . Several videos managed to make it into the public domain where they went viral and were viewed on Youtube hundreds of thousands of times in the following days . The standard protocol8212deny distort coverup8212had clearly been disrupted and BART spokesman Linton Johnson even went so far as to criticize the leaking of the video arguing that rather than clarifying events public access to the video would 8220taint8221 the investigation was on the back foot . BART was on a back foot and popular anger was on an offensive offensive . BART Police are a notoriously problematic organization existing in a gray area between public and private funded by taxpayers but operating under a corporate structure which lacks all accountability and oversight . The structure of the BART police force  Some 500600 protestors and mourners gathered for Grant8217s funeral a number of organizations called a demonstration where he was killed at Fruitvale BART station . The march turned sharply to the left a shortcut to BART headquarters became the target of the crowd . The police response was initially handsoff despite the tenor of the chants 8220No Justice No Peace No Peace FAB and 8220Fruitvale Village8221 in the middle of a historically Latino district which clearly doesn't belong to the local residents . Some of the more radical protestors climbed onto the BART turnstiles displaying a red black and green flag . Some tried to soothe the crowd insisting that burning up the city was 8220too easy and that the message didn't seem to resonate much with the crowd And why should it. The local population knew exactly what was going on why we were protesting and were largely sympathetic. The march wound around Lake Merritt and was thrown off the police who were clearly unprepared for what came next A single police car parked sideways at 8th and Madison to prevent access to the BART headquarters . A few had scribbled 8220Fuck the police8221 and a few had covered the expletive with another message 8220Forgive8221 .

The route I followed is a hundred miles the first twenty a relentless uphill pull to the divide between Cayuga Lake and its twin to the west8212Senecaamp160 Tracing the underside of the vanished glacier the long ascent gains 2000 feet from lakeshore to ridge top . The feeling that I8217m ascending through geologic time is encouraged by the sight of bison grazing an uphill meadow . Perhaps genetically reanimated heirloom wooly mammoths and bison latifrons will mill among these herds in the farmtotable operations of the future .

Speculators increased their netlong positions on sterling or bets that it would rise to the highest level in 312 years in the latest week . But some analysts say there have been few fundamental drivers behind the pound8217s 3 percent climb since the start of the year that there remains a great deal of political uncertainty and that sterling is due a correction lower . Sterling is now trading higher against dollar than during a dip four months before the EU referendum when the currency briefly touched as low as 13836 Versus the euro however which has strengthened across the board in recent months sterling is still trading far lower than its prereferendum levels and is down almost 14 percent since the day of the vote .

---  Edwin Pawlowski a Democrat who was elected in November to his fourth term as mayor despite a sweeping 8220paytoplay8221 indictment went on trial in US District Court in Allentown on 54 criminal counts including bribery conspiracy and fraud . The defense said the Federal Bureau of Investigation had falsely accused him of soliciting bribes to fund his expected 2016 Senate campaign against incumbent Pat Toomey a Republican . The internal watchdog at the US Justice Department said on Wednesday he is launching a review into allegations by Republican lawmakers that the FBI made serious missteps when it sought a warrant to monitor a former adviser to President Donald Trump . The allegations were outlined in a memo commissioned by US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and declassified for public release by President Trump over the objections of Justice Department officials and Democrats on the panel . Attorney General Jeff Sessions told reporters last month he planned to ask Horowitz to investigate the alleged surveillance abuses . The DOJ has already had to fire former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to fire McCabe for lack of candor in a nonpublicly candor . The report was recently used as a basis for the basis for a report by former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe who was recently accused of accusing McCabe of using a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele to justify the warrant  The Trump administration has sharply curtailed a oncecommon practice of granting longterm reprieves to immigrants targeted for deportation adding to an already huge backlog of cases in US immigration courts . The practice became more common after the Obama administration instructed prosecutors in 2011 to prioritize immigration cases involving criminals . In the last year more than 56000 such cases were closed the Reuters analysis of court records found . The trend underscores how the broad crackdown on illegal immigration has sometimes had unintended consequences . AttorneyGeneral Jeff Sessions had vowed to reduce that case backlog but the government8217s aggressive opposition has caused the opposite to happen . Immigrant advocates say some of the most vulnerable immigrants victims of domestic violence and unaccompanied minors could potentially be deported even though they are eligible for a visa because the courts will not set their cases aside . The backlog has grown by another estimated 145000 cases a 27 percent increase according to a Department of Justice estimate since Trump took office in January 2017 according to an estimate of about 542000 cases in January last year . The Obama administration added an average of 41,000 cases to the backlog each year according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse TRAC a New Yorkbased research organization in New York based on data from data from 2011 to 2013 .

---  The international media covering the election took zero notice of the enthusiasm from Venezuela's poorest neighborhoods . Western media has consistently failed to condemn the ongoing street violence by the USbacked opposition who used attacks on voting centers roadblocks economic sabotage and general strikes to prevent the ANC elections from taking place . But the elections happened and the unexpectedly high turnout rattled the nerves of the opposition who didn't expect the traditional base of Chavismo to come out by the millions to support a broad diversity of candidates . The international left has either recognized the shift to the left or not realized its significance . The left in Venezuela is more dynamic than the Stalinist images accorded to it by the western media and US Left . Venezuela is a contradictory revolution which has always been a contradictory movement rooted in the poorest neighborhoods of Venezuela yet reflected through a bureaucratic prism at the top . Such a change is complicated and complicated . The ANC will not fix every problem and it will likely not usher in a socialist economy but radical measures can precipitate a revolutionary dynamic that carries with it a logic of its own . The world has not recognized the international left or recognized its significance as a result of the left . It is a complex phenomenon that is difficult to pigeon pigeon-pigeotot on the top of Venezuela  The international left is to highlight the possibilities amplify the program of the revolutionary wing and educate people internationally about what8217s at stake is at stake . Most of the left has nothing to say about these basic questions while refusing to even discuss the relevance of the Constituent Assembly . The working class in Venezuela recognizes that their fate depends on the outcome of the current struggle they are in a fight for their lives . Chavismo needs concrete solutions not endless denunciations . The only democratic road which cannot be captured by either of the two elites is the struggle to renew the Constitution of 19998221 . The demand to 8220renew the Constitution8221 is a talking point taken directly from the wealthy opposition . The opposition is skillfully using the elections to the National Assembly to retake power and undermine the government by exacerbating the crisis and talking openly of overthrowing Maduro . The vote for the elections was itself a showcase of democracy that Carcione oddly fails to recognize as important as important or legitimate . The need to renew is to hold independent elections should be held within the electoral process on its normal timeline instead of being manipulated by political parties or foreign pressure by the political parties and foreign pressure. The opposition must accept the legitimacy of President Maduro and his legitimacy of

Police video has shown the officers chasing Clark around the side of his grandparents8217 house yelling "Show me your hands8221 and "Gun8221" before firing . Police said they believed Clark held a gun but it turned out to be a mobile phone . The release of the video late on Wednesday sparked street protests . Clark's family through their attorney Benjamin Crump disputed the police account that Clark was breaking windows . Police guidelines posted on the department8217s website do not specify that officers must identify themselves when encountering suspects Sacramento police spokeswoman Linda Matthew said she did not believe such a policy existed . National Fraternal Order of Police said that policies for departments vary across the country but it would be impractical under such circumstances to expect officers to identify themselves in such circumstances . The shooting could lead some police departments to change their rules but such policies can be difficult to follow in the heat of the moment said Eugene O8217Donnell a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City . The officers were already weighed down with rules but the cops are already weighed-down with rules, he said . A gendarme shot  A gunman killed three people in southwestern France on Friday as he held up a car fired on police and seized hostages in a supermarket screaming 8220Allahu Akbar before security forces stormed the building and killed him . More than 240 people have been killed in France in attacks since 2015 by assailants who pledged allegiance to Islamic State or were inspired by the group . The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack . A lieutenantcolonel of the gendarmes who swapped himself in exchange for one of the hostages is fighting for his life in hospital . The gunman was identified by authorities as Redouane Lakdim 25 from the city of Carcassonne . Lakdim was known to authorities for petty crimes but had been under surveillance by security services in 20162017 for links to the radical Salafist movement said Paris prosecutor Francois Molins who is leading the investigation . He said one woman connected to Lakdim had been arrested . France is part of a group of countries whose warplanes have been bombing Islamic State strongholds in Iraq and Syria where the group has lost substantial ground in recent months .

---  Tricia Tillman was one of the highestranking Black professionals in Multnomah County and the first person of color to serve as the director of Multnomahs County Public Health . Tillman's firing has set off a storm of criticism culminating in the launch of a formal investigation into institutional racism in the county government . For many Tillman8217s dismissal demonstrates that white supremacy often takes more subtle and insidious forms than the visible and high profile violence that drew national attention to Portland in May . Portland's Black community8212already among the smallest of any major city in the country8211saw its numbers drop even further For some in Portland the recent firing of Tillman has sent a chilling message about the prospects for upward mobility among professionals of color8212and Black professionals . For some it also signals a potentially serious setback for people of color across the board because arguably no one in the state has done more than Tillman to raise public awareness of equity particularly with respect to the links between health disparities and environmental racism in Oregon the only state in the . state with founding documents that expressly excluded African Americans . Both are part of the long and lethal legacy of white supremacy in Oregon . The . long and deadly legacy of settler colonialism in Oregon  The 2008 release of the fourpart PBS documentary series 8220Unnatural Causes 8212Is Inequality Making Us Sick8221 helped spur national and local dialogue and awareness of the health effects of racism and inequality . In the wake of the subprime lending crisis Black homeownership in Multnomah County fell by more than onequarter from 377 percent to 271 percent . Infant mortality rates among communities of color in the County are higher than the national average and higher rates of asthma and other diseases among those with higher incomes . BlackAfrican American infant mortality rate 822026 times greater than the nonLatino white rate8221 amp160 . The 2014 study also demonstrated significant racial disparities in exposure to diesel particulate matter which the study notes citing the World Health Association is correlated with a host of health issues from asthma and a variety of cancers . Portland's record of health disparities has yet to garner significant media attention over the past few years .

Coal companies use explosives to blast away hundreds of feet of rock in order to unearth underground seams of coal . In the first half of this year at least six domestic coal companies filed for bankruptcy . The price of coal has been plummeting as utility companies shift to significantly cheaper shale gas extracted through the drilling process known as hydraulic fracturing or hydraulic fracturing to produce power energy . Alpha Natural Resources entered the bankruptcy sweepstakes too in August .

In 2012 organizers with the climate justice group Mountain Justice formed a human blockade to shut down work traffic going in and out of the site . In many ways however Mountain Justice protests were among the least extreme in West Virginia's long history of organizing . Drive farther up the mountain and youll find concrete bunkers built by hired guns from the BaldwinFelts Detective Agency sent in to quell a powerful miners strike in 19121913 Less than 10 years later as many as 10000 armed miners from West Virginia would launch the largest labor uprising in the nation 8217s history . The area has remained unblasted because Larry Gibson turned the family plot into a land trust in order to fend off the mining industry .

---  Kwame Anthony Appiah calls for a more helpful posture toward a world of stubborn difference . Appiah says cosmopolitanism is a title in the 8220Issues of Our Time8221 series from WW Norton edited by Henry Louis Gates Jr . The first person we know to have used the word about himself was Diogenes the Cynic in the 4th Century BC . The word comes from a Greek phrase which means 8220citizen of the world8221 The word has a certain pedigree a certain amount of baggage so let’s start by defining terms . Cosmopolitanism does not permit however is a kind of flaccid relativism it insists that there are some universals8212basic human rights for instance8212which are nonnegotiable Otherwise it says difference and disagreement are so much grist for mutually enriching dialogue . Cosmopolitans accept the fact that people live in different ways that free human beings will choose to live in separate ways and will express themselves in different parts of the different ways . The goal isn’t to have everybody agree KAA. You enter a conversation and conversation is about listening as well as talking it is not about expecting consensus or seeking agreement . And that openness to difference comes I think from a kind  A deep part of cosmopolitanism is an engagement with making the world a place in which everybody has as a baseline the resources to live a life of dignity and significance . The liberal tradition is one in which even intolerant speech and thought is permitted until it crosses a boundary to intolerant or dangerous acts or threatens to At that point you have to take sides . The fact that in the United States the attitudes of white people and black people toward these questions is so different suggests that there isn8217t an adequate conversation going on in the U.S. If we have a cosmopolitan conversation one of the things that will come out of it is for instance how many Europeans find it morally astonishing that the US tolerate the level of racial inequality that it does and that our prisons fall way below what anyone in Europe would take to be appropriate human rights minimums . In light of how we should think about identity politics which such a high value on membership of a group, which can be helpful in the first response to those injustices around gender and gender . Identity politics can be invoked to constrain individuality but when it was invoked to resist it constrain it can be an instrument of oppression around gender, it was helpful in response to gender issues around gender .
---  Isle Royale in Lake Superior is a national park and famous for its wolf and moose populations . Isle Royale provides a unique experimental design of what happens when populations are permitted to grow without restraint . There are lessons for human population in the Isle Royale example as well as other tales that could be told . Continuous population growth can lead to habitat degradation great suffering for the dominant animal and eventually a lowered carrying capacity due to habitat destruction . Despite the seriousness of population growth as an agent of planetary damage with serious potential repercussions for human survival there is a tendency for the majority of people to ignore the issue There are many on both the left and right ends of the political spectrum who feel human population growth is not a problem or at the very least a manageable problem . But there are plenty of signs that humans like the moose of Isle Royale are degrading the carrying capacity of Planet Earth8212which is the only habitable island we know of in the Universe . The debate is not helpful since both are problematic since both issues need to be addressed on how you define sustainability to be considered in the sustainability debate for sustainability . In this debate we are likely to define how we are already well past the past and how we define any limits on any sustainability we are well past any past .  Some define sustainably only in terms of human population but that may be the wrong question . Human sustainability ought to be a question of quality of life and when that is the objective we clearly need to reduce our population and consumption . The world is losing species at a rate that is 100 to 1000 times faster than the natural extinction rate . We have a moral obligation to share the Planet with other life but also a responsibility for other life on Earth . We should look at how population growth is contributing to species extirpation . The rising tide of humanity is already self correcting and that humanity is self correcting . We are adding 80 million people to the Earth every year and that somewhere somewhere somewhere that somewhere is already correcting the rising population growth . And some suggest that somewhere that . somewhere that that somewhere . is somewhere that the rising of humanity . is already . that some somewhere that some . is . somewhere to every every year . And that somewhere like northern Europe or somewhere that growth is tapering off and that some places like Northern Europe isn’t doing good enough . The tide tide tide isn”t tepering off .

---  The travel ban was a test of the basic ideological preparedness of a nation that has spent most of its time trying not to imagine a Trump presidency and must now shape that sentiment into the groundwork of a credible resistance . Social media allowed Americans to engage with the news like never before bringing the election to each other at all times of day and night . The new hypermedia political experience invites us instead to align our selfinterest and at a deeper level our very sense of self . We must respond to this new crisis head on by creating a new and more credible account of the events as we know them a narrative that will come to terms not only with the danger presented by Trump but with the forces that vaulted him into power as well as the blinding force of our own shock and dismay because they are the same forces . Even the discontents went to sleep on November 8th under the impression that they were putting a bizarre and exhausting election season behind them that in spite of a few eleventhhour hiccups we would all wake up in the morning look into the mirror and find the triumphant image of Hillary Clinton smiling back at us . The only acceptable outcome of the 2016 election was the election was a landslide victory of Clinton and the victory of the liberal worldview  A majority of white women voted for Trump, writes Julian Zelizer . Zelizer: The rise of Trump is something much worse than an incomprehensible state of affairs . Zelizers: We are fighting against Islamophobia and racism in the broader sense . He says the most urgent questions have yet to be asked are deceptively simple and brazenly inopportune What exactly are we fighting against who are we are fighting for? We will have to expand our anger to neocons like Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan for example who are largely to blame for creating Islamophobia in the first place as byproduct of their ongoing War on Terror . TheResistance will take us right back where we started to the doorstep of a hawkish Third Way politics that while we were busy not asking questions were doing everything in their power not to stop the expansion of the expanding of the war on Terror, Zelizer writes . We don't have the strength until we face the face the punches any more than we don’t have to face the lapses of intelligence lapses, he says . We should avoid falling prey to the illusion that Trump’s ‘carpbagger’ like the ‘dawning’ of a ‘war on Terror
---  A number of structural reasons indicate that the Democratic party will not be able to revive itself soon in the way that liberal activists desire . A better case can be made for continued dealignment since the sixties despite a rise in party identification among the electorate . The parties have come to a consensus on personal rather than collective democracy privatization of government services is likely to be the trend of the future . Continued weak party identification low voter turnout and both parties8217 emerging consensus on privatization suggest that a commitment to the workingclass is highly unlikely to come about The recent competition for House minority leader between Nancy Pelosi and Martin Frost and Harold Ford speaking for the . 8220conservative8221 side was overdramatized Such personalization doesn8217t take into consideration the structural reasons why the . Democratic party is compelled to follow a basically conservative line. Domestic repression has become a necessity because of the recent transformation of the American economy . The progressive instinct within the Democratic . party will remain a minority and mostly unheard voice of the . progressive instinct in the Democratic Party will remain in the minority and largely unheard voice . Even if the Democrats return to power a dismantling of the domestic repressive structure is inconceivable. Domestic repressive structure 8211 except at the margins 8211 seems inconceivable .  There can never be a return to the high turnout rates before Progressive reforms . Progressive reforms weakened parties included the Australian ballot and nonpartisan elections at the state and local levels . When elections become nonpartisan this typically favors conservatism . Neither party attempts to win elections anymore by mobilizing the millions of citizens who don't vote this simply will not change. Neither party supports electoral reforms that might spur voter turnout this too is unlikely to change. The likely future scenario is the continued dominance of singleissue groups that splinter ideological cohesion around broader class and economic concerns . The hope in the 1980s and 1990s that parties would be able to reclaim their central role by becoming serviceorientation has not borne full fruition because of greater contradicting institutional tendencies has failed to bear full fruition due to the fact that the executive party steps in to fill the vacuum when the legislative party is not strong or cohesive . It is possible that a weak realignment in favor of the Republican party has already occurred but it is limited in its capacity to achieve programmatic goals because of a weaker base than a weaker party base than individual candidate success . The traditional argument has been that traditional party loyalties have been that declining partisanship among both legislators and counter counter the counter argument that the traditional argument that traditional
---  The United Arab Emirates8217 military have been told not to do anything to worsen a sevenmonth diplomatic crisis with Qatar a senior military officer said on Tuesday a move which may reduce tensions over mutual accusations about military overflights . The four Arab powers imposed travel diplomatic and trade sanctions on Qatar in June 2017 accusing it of supporting terrorism . Former president of Romania Traian Basescu joined more than 10000 people in the Moldovan capital on Sunday to rally in support of reunification between Romania and Moldova . Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was detained on Sunday in Germany five months after he went into self-imposed exile from Spain where he faces up to 25 years in prison for organizing an illegal prison for illegal jailing him . The demonstration was peaceful though police said they detained 21 people who wanted to disrupt the rally seizing gas masks masks and knives . The Moldovan government often locks horns with the proRussian President Igor Dodon who wants closer ties to Moscow and to join a Moscowled customs union . The country that is now Moldova was part of Tsarist Russia during the 19th century and known as Bessarabia after World War One it joined what was known as Greater Romania but it was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 .  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stressed his intention to revise Japan8217s pacifist postwar USdrafted constitution . Puigdemont could take his case to Germany's highest court which had in 2005 blocked the extradition to Spain on an EU arrest warrant of a GermanSyrian alQaeda suspect . The LDP adopted a proposal to revise the pacifist constitution in line with a plan floated by Abe last year to explicitly refer to the SelfDefense Forces . Abe's ratings in a slump amid a suspected cronyism scandal and coverup apologized again on Sunday for causing anxiety and loss of confidence in his government . Abe has denied that he or his wife intervened in the sale of stateowned land at a huge discount to a nationalist school operator with ties to his wife . His close ally Finance Minister Taro Aso has also denied involvement in the alterations made by ministry officials . Public opinion polls last weekend showed support for Abe's cabinet sinking as low as 31 percent with majorities saying he bears some responsibility for the affair . The sliding support rates could dash Abe's hopes of winning a third threeyear term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party LDP leader in a party vote in September victory in which would set him on track to become Japan's longest ruling premier . Abe offers no sign of stepping down
---  Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva turned himself in to police on Saturday ending a daylong standoff to begin serving a 12year prison sentence for corruption that derails his bid to return to power . US State Department said on Saturday reports of mass casualties from an alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma Syria were 8220horrifying and would demand an international response if confirmed . Former President Lula was flown by police to the southern city of Curitiba where he was tried and convicted late last year and taken to the federal police headquarters there to serve his sentence . Protesters supporting Lula clashed with police outside the walls of the building and police used stun grenades tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd . Lula insisted on his innocence and called his bribery conviction a political crime but said he would turn himself in after a fiery speech hours earlier to a crowd of supporters of his Workers Party outside the union building in Sao Bernardo do Campo .

Washington said reports of mass casualties from an alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma were 8220horrifying8221 and would if confirmed 8220demand an immediate response by the international community . The Russianbacked Syrian state denied government forces had launched any chemical attack as the reports began circulating on Saturday night and said rebels in the Douma town were in a state of collapse and spreading false news Reuters could not independently verify the reports . The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the conflict . President Bashar alAssad has won back control of nearly all of eastern Gouta in a Russianbacked military campaign that began in February leaving just Douma in rebel hands . The offensive has been one of the deadliest of the seven-year-long war killing more than 1600 civilians according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights . U.S. State Department recalled a 2017 sarin gas attack in northwestern Syria that the West and the United Nations blamed on Assad's government for the sarin attack in northwest Syria that was blamed on the Assad regime for the attack .
---  There is now a trend of wearing red on Fridays in silent protest of the Bush junta . The Eastern Seaboard has always been more repressed than the West . But ordinary nonpolitical white collar working puds the dreary commuter tribes in the suburbs and outlying towns are starting to whisper it among themselves . The mind of the guy who now has one finger on the red nuclear button and the other up his nose is a matter that should be talked about and is being talked about by ordinary non-political working puds . Bush is not merely dumb8212he may well be nuts. Every day his actions look more like a genuinely disordered and dangerous mind at work . Stupidity alone cannot account for George Bush8217s behavior . The president has the power of a narcissist who finds himself with the kind of power of the power he has himself with . The kind of behavior would be normal behavior for a malignant narcissist . The U.S. president has found the world is inspired by God and commandly see his commandly commandly commanded by God, according to Levy Levy . The media would conclude that he is inspired and inspired by divinely see the world of God and commanded the execution of a criminal .  George Bush has what campaign strategists call 8220assscratcher appeal8221 with the average guy . He also seems to have a mesmerizing effect on conservative Americans that is totally inexplicable to the rest of us . To them he looks like the first president in a long time to assert what is 8220right about America and especially so following a president who was deemed 8220slick8221 and kept a woman under his desk . Bush has charisma to those who believe the world is a mean place and that subtler considerations only get in the way . Neoconservatives of course are willing to kill you to get it in the first place . Bush is touching something within the American unconscious. Whether he is a manifestation of our national mental state or whether we are unwitting agents of his could be argued It certainly seems symbiotic We did elect him for a reason and history will probably record that reason as not being a very pretty one the similarities in our national behavior being unnervingly similar to those of prewar Germany . To the end of the Bush analogy and I8217ll be damned if I am going to apologize for it. Bush is touched something deep in the German unconscious. To them I think it must make Karl Rove pee his pants

This is the conclusion at which I arrived after witnessing hundreds of conflicts all over the world but can such an existence be really called life reality is 8220authentic8221 only if experienced holistically and firsthand . Planet Earth is getting gradually ruined Surrounded by uniformed, perpetual misery passivity and amnesia one is not aware of suffering  Ernesto Che Guevara had to leave his provincial bubble of family which consisted of doctors enjoying their upper middleclass life .

Cable traffic from capitals throughout the Greater Middle East made public thanks to WikiLeaks shows that US policymakers have a detailed and profound picture of the depths of corruption and nepotism that prevail among some 8220allies8221 in the region . In a cynical Great Power calculation Washington continues to sacrifice the prospects of the region on the altar of 8220security8221 . The region is littered with dusty creaking now exceedingly nervous dictatorships in which government is theft . The Bush administration's deeply flawed sometimes dishonest Global War on Terror replayed the worst mistakes of Cold War policy . One of those errors involved the socalled domino theory involved the idea that the US had to make a socalled socalled notion that the world would make a stand in Vietnam or Burma or the rest of Asia if not the rest would fall to communism or the Soviet Union . It adds up to absurdly absurdized modern fears and fantasies and fantasies of domino theories that add up to modern modern fears .  President Abdel Aziz Bouteflika was elected in 1999 a secular rampart against the influence of radical Muslim fundamentalism in Algeria as well as among the AlgerianFrench population in France .

Cruz delivered a wonderfully articulate and moving response to the ills that have plagued the nation during the long night of Barack Obamas tenure as well as a stinging rebuke to the last 100 years of the left attempting to remold the country and shatter the American ideal . Heres the complete transcript of the speech from the speech by Ted Cruz, the candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination in Iowa . The speech was delivered by Cruz at the end of the day at Camp Cruz in Iow County, Iowa . Cruz said: "Tonight is a victory for millions of Americans who have shouldered the burden of seven years of Washington deals run amok" He added that the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the Washington establishment or by the media or the Washington lobbyists or the Tea Party. We are inspired by the stories of heroism that I see every day working men like Jerry Dunleavy from Columbus Ohio who requested an entire month off his job to come to Iowa to live at camp Cruz and to volunteer full time.

Western intervention appeared to be unlikely to alter military balance with Assad in strong position in strongest position of power . Syria agreed in 2013 to give up its chemical weapons after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Douma . The US has been leery over decision to use force force to withdraw roughly 2000 of US military involvement in the Middle East and is eager to withdraw its troops in Syria taking part in the campaign against Islamic State fighters but is eager for a more sustained US military presence in Syria under no circumstances . A US official familiar with the military planning said there could be more air strikes if the intelligence indicates Assad has not stopped making importing or using chemical weapons including chlorine for civilian use of chemical weapons

NGO Rainbow for Africa said that on Friday evening the French brought a Nigerian migrant to the railway station of the Italian border town of Bardonecchia . The French customs said they entered the clinic which is in the train station and conducted a urine test on the man because they suspected him of drug trafficking . The NGO Rainbow For Africa said they conducted a U.N. facility run by the French border . The episode angered many politicians some of whom saw it as a violation of Italian territory .

---  On Wednesday President Barack Obama spoke at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington . Video and transcript of the speech are below . On Wednesday the President spoke at a memorial to the King family who have sacrificed and inspired so much to President Clinton and President Clinton President Carter President Carter Vice President Biden Jill President Biden . Obama: "Because they marched America became more free and more fair not just for AfricanAmericans but for women, Latinos, Asians and Native Americans for Catholics Jews and Muslims for gays for gays and Muslims . The entire world drew strength from that example whether it be young people who watched the Iron Curtain and would eventually tear down that Iron Wall who would eventually end the apartheid of South Africa or the young people inside South Africa who won’t eventually tear it down . The victory is the hope that is their hearts in their hope in their hearts, Obama said. That is the depth that I and millions of Americans owe the depth of their desire and hope in the depth I and Millions of Americans owes those who owe those of those that owe that depth that is that depth I . owe those Americans owe those that owes those of Americans that owe them that depth" The speech was delivered by the President and the President  Dr King explained that the goals of AfricanAmericans were identical to working people of all races . The test was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many for the black custodian and the white steelworker the immigrant dishwasher and the Native American veteran . But the test was not whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few but whether the jobs that once provided a foothold into the middle class have been reduced . The task will not be easy since 1963 the economy has changed since 1963 . The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice but it doesn8217t bend on its own . The gap in wealth between races has not lessened it8217s grown as President Clinton indicated the position of all working Americans regardless of color has eroded making the dream Dr King described even more elusive. The task to answer that call is our great unfinished business. We shouldn’t fool ourselves The task is not easy Since 1963 the trade has become harder In too many communities across this country in cities and suburbs and rural hamlets the shadow of poverty casts a pall over our youth their lives a fortress of substandard schools and diminished prospects inadequate health care and perennial violence and persistent violence . And our politics has reduced the bargaining power of technology
---  Those disturbed by the United States8217 largestintheworld incarceration rate have some new reasons to be cautiously optimistic . Conservatives from Newt Gingrich to Jeb Bush to Rand Paul are advocating for less incarceration and an end to employment discrimination for people with criminal records hinting that crime panics won't be the campaign fodder they once were . This pivotal moment presents the socialist and social democratic left with possibilities and pitfalls . The working class the poor LGBT folks and people of color are all at disproportionate risk for victimization . I will describe groups that are providing nonpolice responses to violence that stop the causes of violence and discuss how understanding the causes will help us understand possible solutions . The Big 8220Reform8221 That Hurt is Hurt. The government claimed that incarceration8212would stop violence and devastating economic and devastating communities of poor are up up up and down past and down, but instead it has helped shore up the poor communities of color while whites are up and up against the poor are devastating and down . The time has never been better to show that reducing inequality providing health care creating affordable housing and reinvesting in schools are all crimestopping measures are crimestoppers measures that will stop the cause of violence, writes John Sutter. The Big Reform8221  The National Research Council convened a group of experts to determine whether the incarceration boom and the crime decline were related . The magnitude of the crime reduction remains highly uncertain and the evidence suggests it was unlikely to have been large822113 One of the studies cited found incarceration was responsible for 510 percent of crime drop . I linger on the effects of prison not just to show that the current government response to crime has been horribly counterproductive and supportive of white supremacy but also because understanding how the government response has hurt helps us understand how it can be changed . Restorative justice work helps address harm after it has happened before it happens without appealing to appealing to the public . Interrupters a group made famous in the 2011 documentary the Cure Cure Cure for Violence takes a public health approach to stop violence before it occurs . The group employs interrupters who are often involved in violence and employs a public approach to reduce violence in which they are working to stop the violence themselves and often involve the victims of violence themselves to stop it from being involved in the criminal justice system . The restorative justice works is undergoing wide adoption as alternatives to traditional criminal justice procedures for crimes as diverse as theft and murder .

Sudanese government has expelled some foreign aid groups accusing them of espionage . Collette Valentine a TV producer visiting from the United Kingdom and Ali Gunn a British media consultant last week returned from Darfur where they attended the first 8220International Conference on the Challenge Facing Women in Darfur . Valentine says that articles about Darfur in the international press make her feel as if she visited a completely different region . A quarter of the seats in the Sudanese parliament are occupied by women . The women of Sudan are a real force Historically there have been female leaders . Some members of the women8217s union have been elected as ministers in the government and a third of families in the camps are headed by women In recent years some members of . the women have been . elected as Ministers in the Darfur are elected as . ministers in recent years . Some of the female leaders in the . Darfur camps are women and they have direct links right down from the most educated academic women from the professional classes to grassroots people .  We went to two camps in Darfur and we saw people eeking out a simple existence No bullet holes no tanks and no fighting The only military vehicles belonged to the United Nations We were given carte blanche to wander around the camps as we pleased and talk to anyone we liked Many spoke English I was appalled that so much reporting in our newspapers has no basis in reality Cheap and lazy journalism at its worst . People said that NGOs did not want the fighting to stop so that they can continue to be paid . People resented how much that money for the UN was being wasted in front of their eyes . None had seen any money from the Save Darfur campaign and they resented that money was being raised in their names . There was very little evidence of external aid Darfur is the size of France so we didn’t go to all the camps . People in the camps were not starving and healthy and people were spartan but clean and well-clean and clean . Living conditions in the spartane but people were very aware of their personal space . Oil is all important for the benefit of the people is being used for the people was all important of the oil is all the important of Darfur Campaign Collette Valentine . Not a day goes by without

In 1964 the Grateful Dead a former jug band setting out in a new direction that would be called 8220acid rock8221 played its first gig Their adventures became the basis of Tom Wolfe8217s 8220The Electric KoolAid Acid Test8221 . Frank and Jamie lived in a galaxy far far away from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which the GOP blamed for the fall for making loans to poor people with minimal down payments . Unfortunately for the poor who always get the least portion and then the blame it was hard to get into Georgetown U where Jamie met Frank let alone the Sorbonne and MIT where Jamie continued her education . The poor might not have put any money down 8230 then borrowed on the property to buy more 8230 like Jamie and Frank . If the Dodgers wound up on the bonfire it could have happened to anyone .

---  August 15 2006 was the first of three terrible Tuesdays that struck Hatch back in August 2006 . On that fateful day rainwater overflowed the Placitas Arroyo submerging streets and properties in several feet of water . Of Hatch's estimated 1600 residents at the time 500 were temporarily or permanently displaced and more than 400 homes and businesses suffered some degree of damage . 95 percent of Hatch8217s residents did not carry flood insurance when Little Katrina hit an Frontera NorteSur followup story reported a year later In 2016 residents are still financially vulnerable . Only 61 local policies valued at 8827900 and costing annual premiums of 87718 in total were registered with the National Flood Insurance Program according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency . The public schools took a hit in the Hatch Valley School District saw student enrollment drop from 1556 pupils during the 200506 school year to 1408 in the 20062007 academic year according to New Mexico Public Education Department numbers . The Great Recession drought and changes in the chile industry interceded almost as if the flood was a bad omen as the Great Recession Drought and changes to chile pepper crop intercedceded in recent years . In the 2016 fiscal year FEMA is limited to paying out a maximum of 33000  FEMA provided 1 26629786 in individual and housing assistance to eligible residents . FEMA maintained an active project for Hatch until early 2011 after a new apartment complex for flood victims opened . Texas8217 Central Market kicked in donations with Texas Central Market kicking in donations Nordyke said the response of both government and civil society stands out . FEMA registered victims even extending a hand to those who did not have flood insurance . The flood left psychological scars in displaced children who required counseling when storm clouds gathered . The last residents did not move out of the site until December 2010 with the last residents moving out in December 2010 after 18 months while permanent housing was built . The town's population creeped back upward but growth was even faster in nearby rural communities outside the flood plain . The local government forced the local government to relocate local government offices to relocate for a few months when the flooding forced a few local officials to relocate a few other officials to a few years . The flooding left some people never came back and some people were scared to death8221 she said . The small town of Hatch is now an empty piece of land with the old trailer park is nowadays an empty part of the old site is now a site with utility connections and utilities .

---  Over 6400 uniformed American servicemembers and 2330 mercenaries have died in the Global War on Terror since 2001 but their corpses might end up in a landfill when they return to the U.S. Since 2001 casualties of American Afghan European Pakistani Yemeni Yemeni Somali Iraqi and other nationalities have fallen . Suicide Suicides are one form of casualty that is often overlooked to the overlooked military troubles during military deployments . Despite these 8220immense tolls we must remind ourselves of war8217s true human cost amp160 United States8217 Loss amp160 Juxtaposition provides insight into Pentagon delusion . The future of all military healthcare is in jeopardy in order to stave off this inevitable collapse the Pentagon adopts the Costanza approach to medical care and coureformches and couches . The next generation of MIAs from Iraq Afghanistan the Horn of Africa is one way to avoid the inevitable collapse of the Pentagon adopt this approach to the Pentagon’s ‘reformreformable” – ‘Reformformable military’ – – “reformic” - “Reformic.” The Pentagon adoptts a ‘holistic” approach to “formicomic”  The Pentagon issued a public service announcement designed to help increase suicide prevention and commissioned a study to recommend improvements for suicideprevention programs . The study entitled The War Within Suicide Prevention in the US Military defined several ways to improve prevention programs including implementing a tracking program for the entire American military which would log suicides and suicide attempts comprehensively . The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff views military recruitment through a distorted lens that glosses over socioeconomic discrepancies and the failure of the American education . Tragically many servicememembers join or remain in uniform for the hypereconomic benefits associated with military service . While Washington policymakers who send American troops into imperial misadventures relax in leather chairs in the Hart Office Building drink scotch and revel in their daily partisan assaults across the aisle the American warfighter is absolutely drained Suffering from multiple deployments to preventable wars like Iraq then they must do so to make ends meet . In Afghanistan and America those who resist national militarization lose out on educational opportunity Now in Afghanistan the America and Afghanistan share similar a common bond in this regard the U.S. Warfighter is exhausted and suffering from unfathomable tragedies one cannot blame these men and women for looking out for the non-violent alternatives one wonders if the Pentagon
---  In July 2004 Bush administration officials appointed by this administration floated a bizarre and unprecedented proposal to postpone or even cancel the scheduled November 2004 presidential election . No such election has ever been postponed in American history even during the darkest days of national emergencies during the civil war and the world wars of the last century . This latest outrage of the lawless BushCheney regime has already met the widespread denunciation it richly deserves in many quarters . This crisis calls for a dramatic public response from the American People demonstrating conclusively that we will not allow this illegitimate gang to destroy our democracy and our freedom . The whole world now knows that the illegal invasion of Iraq was spelled out in March 2003 based on alleged weapons weapons lies about weapons . The world knows that that the invasion in March March 2003 was based on the alleged weapons of Iraq based on allegations about weapons of Saddam Hussein . The US military energy tax trade trade and oil pipelines opened up new opportunities for them by the Bush administration. Meanwhile his administration8217s imperialist militarist goals and its intention of waging perpetual wars to enrich its base by waging perpetual war to enrich the 8220vast capitalizing on its base. The world now know that the oil and gas pipelines. The US government knows that it was .  The BushCheney administration has become identified with disdain for human rights and the rule of law itself . The current unelected US government is cynically exploiting fear and extreme nationalist fundamentalist fervor in an attempt to retain their illegitimate hold on power . The suggestion that the 2004 election could be postponed is itself a call to arms to defend the ideal of American democratic selfgovernment The Assault on Civil Liberty should be seen as an admission of failure and absolute moral bankruptcy by the Bush administration . We have to choose between the U.S. government of power currently enshrined in our national charter and the laws that govern the government currently enshrine in our charter and history . We must look into our own hearts and minds and determine who we are and determine our identity as a nation and determine what we are. We need to be a better line behind this new line of American military force to be behind the American people line behind the line of military force. We must choose between this line of power. of Bush8217s fanatical and the Torture Stupid Stupid . It is an admission that that of unaccountable laws that arise out of the 8220war against terrorism and laws currently enshrable laws. It is a failure to be seen by their bankruptcy of their bankruptcy.
---  Britain wants to benefit from EU trade deals and have a say over EU laws passed during its transition out of the bloc . David Davis set out the government8217s position on a transition period looking to offer something for both those who want to keep close ties with the European Union after leaving . The balancing act designed to appease both business and Brexiteers is a taste of things to come for Prime Minister Theresa May who has been unable to prevent divisions in her party repeatedly spilling out into the open . May has had to struggle to keep her lawmakers united over everything from transition to the future relationship to the socalled Brexit dividend . Jacob ReesMogg who heads a hardline group of proBrexit Conservative lawmakers that could have enough members to topple May has said Britain must stop accepting negotiating terms set by the EU and that current transition plans would render it a 8220vassal state8221 after the end of 40 years of union . May is aware that the plan to change little of the current relationship immediately after Britain formally leaves on March 29 2019 is fuelling anger among proEU lawmakers . Israel for the first time that it bombed a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007 and said it would not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons . Israel said it bombed  Israeli military describes in detail events leading up to the night of Sept 56 2007 in which it said eight warplanes F16s and F15s carried out the mission after taking off from the Ramon and Hatzerim air bases . They flew to Deir alZor region 450 km 270 miles northwest of Damascus and dropped 18 tonnes of munitions on the site it said . Israel decided at the time against acknowledging the raid on the reactor so as not to provoke Syrian President Bashar alAssad into retaliating . The Israeli military on Wednesday declassified internal intelligence reports in Hebrew some of them partly redacted One dated March 30 2007 said 8220Syria has set up within its territory a nuclear reactor for the production of plutonium through North Korea which according to an initial worstcase assessment is liable to be activated in approximately another year . The mission to destroy the reactor started at 1030 pm on Sept 5 and ended with the return of the warplanes at 230 am the next day the Israeli military said . The disclosure on Wednesday stemmed in part Yadlin said from years of pressure by the Israeli media on military censors to allow them to publish Israelisourced information about the raid . In 2008 the United States presented what it described as intelligence showing that North Korea had helped Syria with
---  There is not an industrial company on earth not an institution of any kind 8211 not mine not yours not anyone8217s 8211 that is sustainable I stand convicted by me myself alone not by anyone else as a plunderer of the earth but not by our civilization . We feign concern for our horrendous conditions of poverty socioeconomic inequality deteriorating public health and severe environmental degradation . Yet we continue along with complete cognitive dissonance in that the crux of our lives contribute to perpetuate and exacerbate the unsustainable and morally reprehensible conditions of our existence . While we are all marginally responsible for the multitude of calamities befalling us the one group who bears the brunt of the blame for our social and ecological decay is the wealthy . The irony though is that the very people who run the systems that incessantly construct and promulgate these harmful redundant or unnecessary products are the richest and most successful people on earth . The wealthy in our society then become the people with the most power and influence are the people least deserving of our respect. They should not be in the position to make decisions about our collective lives and the workings of our society because their financial success is completely antithetical to societal justice and sustainability . We should look upon them with the utmost skepticism and even disdain  Wealth has always been in the hands of the few to the detriment of the many . Yet we rationalize this immoral situation and pretend that the proverbial 8220pie8221 of which we all need a slice is infinite in size and that wealth is accessible to anyone . We assume that being rich is not only acceptable but aspirational It is neither in a just and sustainable world . Poverty only exists because excessive wealth exists and neither is compatible with a sustainable and humane civilization . To achieve a sustainable world we must relinquish our use of nonrenewable resources we must utilize renewable resources at a level in which they have the time and ability to replenish and we must leave no waste that is not regenerative . To be able to be so wealthy without shame guilt or acknowledgement that your own wealth impedes the lives of others is to be either ignorant or indifferent we are either ignorant, indifferent or indifferent to our own wealth, writes John Defterios . We are not only completely socially corrupt we are spelling our own doom. We are spelling ourselves ourselves doom, he writes. We need to rethink our morality and rationalize their continuation of their greed and we need to relinquish their desire for opulence. To achieve an equitable world we need relinquish ourselves

The Founding Fathers pledged their lives their fortunes and their rights and their sacred rights were sacred . There was no conspiracy to impede our heritage that our ancestors established We were attacked by what appeared to be what our pioneer ancestors established but we were surrounded by mercenaries snipers snipers snipers . The water rights that my father owns were first registered in 1891 by the State of Nevada . There is a report from a sniper that he was keeping me in my van with my wife and two of my daughters with me . The state of Nevada is important a sovereign state its own unit which entered the union in 1864 It entered equal to the original states it is its own entity and state laws are important. The government asserts there are no rights only privileges and unless we pay  The crux of the issue isamp160 are we a state or not They say grazing is a privilege they can revoke and charge fees If it is only a matter of money it is no problem in fact Mr Whipple showed a copy of a check made out to Clark County . In Clark County there were 53 ranchers who owned rights There is only one one still out on the range .

---  Coexistence seems to be the new bling for environmentalists and bureaucrats making money and careers from wolves and grizzly bears . In practice there is more arm waving than substance and ample trite platitudes in lieu of sophisticated understanding when it comes to the contingencies of cohabiting with grizzlies and wolves . The art of coexisting with large carnivores such as bears wolves and cougars is not rocket science . The presence of foods near people is an enduring challenge with bruins but one for which the solutions are in a category of nobrainers Don't leave dog food out on the porch Don't put out bird feeders Get rid of garbage or put it in bearproof containers of which there are now many effective designs . There is no shortage of methods for reducing conflicts with bears over livestock crops or even animals killed by hunters . Electric fencing can work wonders protecting beehives sheep newborn calves and corn fields . For hunters carry bear spray for hunters keep a clean campaicin clean campin spray and sure as hell as hell don't dump carcasses nearby . Don8217t leave recent recent kills out in the woods or don't expect you sneak around in the dark or expect friends to help cart it out to bump into a path in dark  A nub issue when it comes to coexistence is what goes on between peoples8217 ears and attitudes . Just how motivated are people to implement the requisite coexistence practices versus complaining about the inconvenience and cost of living with predators while picking up the phone to avail themselves of predatorkillers employed by the taxpayerfunded federal agency named Wildlife Services . But 8220people8221 are not just one big smoosh which is what8217s so often implied when wildlife managers talk about 8220peoples82178221 or 8220the publics82178222 attitudes . But even allowing for the fuzziness and complexity of perspectives 8220 people8221 can be usefully lumped into a few broad categories relevant to understanding practical problems of coexistence . Regressive Reprobates Reluctant Pragmatists and Uninformed Innocents and Affirmative Innovators need to be lumped if useful orientation to coexist challenges is to occur especially at broad scales .

---  Noel Lyons found herself in a Vail Colo hospital in the spring of 2010 after another round of binge drinking binge drinking . Her boyfriend and sister decided she needed rehabilitative help because their resources were limited they turned to the free Total Freedom Program a Florida ministry for women and men . She was introduced to about five other 8220girls8221 all white and ranging in age from the 20s to the 50s who lived in the house . Lyons began to speak to me in a stream of nonsensical sounds to imitate praying in tongues to rid the house of demons . Lyons says she arrived 8220scared out of my mind and holding a decorative pillow with the image of a buffalo on it . The house mom rifled through Lyons8217 bag of clothes She pulled out particular garments and told her 8220Well you won8217t be wearing that8221 that could evoke demons she was soon told to put it in the trash . Lyons was given a rules handbook and told she had to sign an 8220intake form promising to obey the community8217s edicts . She read in the handbook that she would be forbidden to contact anyone except her immediate family for nine months . She refused to sign the form without a lawyer which she found odd  Lyons was told when she entered the war room that she was not permitted to talk to or have eye contact with the men either there or outside Segregation of the sexes was rigidly enforced Courtship and relationships could be carried out within the community only if they were approved and mediated by the pastor . Relationships outside the community were forbidden All new arrivals during their first three months spent every morning and every afternoon in the war rooms 8220doing teachings8221 which consisted of listening to recordings from Pastor Guy Iannello8217s Eternal Library of 800 Teachings They were required to take copious notes . After three months if program approval was granted a resident was permitted to get an outside job to help support the ministry by that time residents typically had severed ties with most friends and relatives . The morning routine included recorded religious music followed by prayer There were prayers for orphans single mothers or fathers and those who had been abandoned Then the group prayed in tongues . Lyons said she wondered 8220What does this have to do with helping me with my problem8221 She was given a lengthy form and told to circle all her 8220sins8221 such as sex before marriage lesbianism sodomy masturbation masturbation and adultery . She circled the words that applied to her .

Washington slapped sanctions on two of Russia8217s biggest intelligence agencies the Federal Security Service FSB and the GRU military intelligence service in response to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and malicious cyber attacks .

---  People anxious to watch oral arguments in Ashcroft v Raich started arriving outside the US Supreme Court at 5 am on Monday Nov 29 . By 900 more than 200 concerned citizens had formed an Lshaped line across the wide plaza and then east on Constitution Avenue . Justice Stevens presided because Chief Justice Rehnquist is undergoing treatment for thyroid cancer . William H Rehnberg helped draft the Controlled Substances Act which this case is really all about was his work product He helped draft it as a young lawyer in the Nixon White House having gotten the job for among other services rendered hassling black voters in Arizona . The Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration are petitioning the Court to invalidate an injunction issued by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal in October 2003 allowing Angel Raich and Diane Monson to obtain and use cannabis in accordance with California law . Acting Solicitor General Paul Clement remade the key points Congress is entitled to enforce the Controlled Substance Act . Californians growing and using cannabis within the state will inevitably have an impact on interstate commerce The relevant precedent was set by Wickard v Filburn a 1942 case upholding the right to limit the amount of wheat a farmer could grow for home consumption in 1942 . The Petitioner goes first The petitioner goes first  Randy Barnett a libertarian professor of constitutional law argued for RaichMonson that their activity growing and using cannabis as medicine had been entirely intrastate and noneconomic . The Institute of Medicine Report released in 2000 found that smoked marijuana 8220has no future as medicine . The drug companies will find and synthesize the good components of the plant minus the bad components smoking is harmful per se The Court should not secondguess Congress amp160 The Respondent8217s Case Randy Barnett said that the fungibility of marijuana does not mean possession for personal medical use is economic activity . Justices Breyer and Souter pursued the point that California couldn8217t effectively limit the set of medical users . Breyer foresaw large numbers of cannabis consumers resulting in lowered prices resulting in lowering prices thus undermining the feds8217 ability to control contraband . Barnett also pointed out that some people benefit from smoked marijuana and that he missed an opportunity to inform the tone was slightly apologetic smoking the sin of all time and that smoking marijuana is sin of the sin . Barnett said there is no better drug and delivery system than herbal medicine for nausea and nausea for nausea . Barnett argued that there is there any other drug to enhance appetite for . Nor is there other other drug

Claims administrators and class counsel are going to have to be wary of bots attempting to take advantage of class members . The average recovery for class members in the app case expected to be 39,000 dollars . The total of the scam in the case may provide economic justification for the size of the case to be a fraud . The US Attorney's office has referred the apparently fraudulent claims to the US Attorney8217s office for investigation .

---  70 Years ago this week General Franco launched his attack on the Spanish Republic backed by Hitler Mussolini and tacitly by the US and other Western powers . The Western democracies stood to one side or indirectly assisted on the fascist side of the Spanish Civil War . Western democracies were more comfortable with a fascist regime in Spain than a strong defender of the status quo of a strong reaction and a strong victory of a Spanish government . The lack of support from the Western democracies for the first democratic government seen in Spain in the first half of the twentieth century was in stark contrast to the lack of support from the Western Mediterranean powers for the first democratic government in Spain . They did not a finger to the fascist rallies in the face of the massive military support for the fascist troops from Hitler and Mussolini . None of the class interests of the fascist forces were other than that of any offensive offensive offensive to any offensive to the European coup . None other than Winston Churchill put it as related to any other than the failure of the Western dominant classes of the authorities to support the fascist regime of Spain . The West did not put their class interests in the move other than those of the fascists .  The cruelty reached unheardof dimensions such as the killing of parents so that the assassins could adopt their young children . The brutality and bestiality of the fascist forces was well illustrated by the response of the head of the Spanish Foreign Legion General Millan Astray to a critical speech by Miguel de Unamuno . The Western democracies that had remained silent during Franco8217s coup openly supported his government regarding Franco as their ally against the Soviet Union . When Franco died the Army the Church and the landowning oligarchy wanted to maintain fascismamp160 without Franco . The Catholic Church was the Spanish Church hierarchy which had called for a military coup during the Republican government and the priests who prepared the lists of people to be executed . Even today many churches in Spain still have monuments celebrating the coup and many churches still have statues of the dictatorship and still have commemorated the dictatorship . The liberals have agreed with this reading as a bulwark against fascism too . The Roman Catholic Church is considered too perhaps too perhaps perhaps too maybe too perhaps as a long-lasting and perhaps too long-standing dictatorship too perhaps long-lived fascism too long and lasting and perhaps very cruel and lasting . The Church has been even more vocal than the leadership of the PP has been more vocal in Spain

The city will 8220ensure zero increase of such structures8221 this year and will continue to relocate people out of the city center . Beijing last year set a similar goal but there was no indication in this year's report whether the target was met . Beijing launched a citywide safety blitz in November following a deadly fire that has resulted in the demolition of buildings that violate safety codes and the eviction of thousands of migrant workers . The evictions sparked unusually direct criticism from China8217s intellectuals students and journalists who say the government is unfairly targeting the vulnerable underclass . There will also be no letting up in a campaign to sanitize ancient hutong alleyways that last year displaced migrants as many were evicted from homes and businesses were shut down along the narrow passageways The city has also been shut down by the city's safety blitz .

---  Donald Trump is promoting these as the basis for a promised 1 trillion in new infrastructure investments . But the new administration has also promised cuts to public spending . Publicprivate partnerships are one of the surest ways of shoveling money into the gaping maws of corporate wallets used with varying names by neoliberal governments around the world . The result has been disastrous 8212 public services and infrastructure maintenance is consistently more expensive after privatization . The only mention of infrastructure is approving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines without environmental reviews and an intention to expedite environmental reviews for 8220high priority infrastructure projects8221 . The Trump plan appears to go even even even to give tax credits to developers with investments at all that net new investments are made . The EPI report asks several questions to an Economic Policy Institute analysis . The lack of details here are daunting and incredibly important for starters we don’t know if the Trump plan seems to be a plan to decide which projects already need to be built or which will be built which needs to be expedited environmental reviews . How do we decide to decide if the tax credits are eligible to be given to private financiers and developers and developers in existing projects already are eligible for tax credits instead of transferring taxpayer largesse on existing projects  Private finance initiatives are a scheme concocted by the Conservative Party and enthusiastically adopted by the New Labour of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown the results are disastrous A 2015 report in The Independent reveals that the British government owes more than 163222 billion to banks and businesses as a result of private finance initiatives . The headline debt is based on 8216unitary charges8217 which start this month and will continue for 35 years . They include fees for services rendered such as maintenance and cleaning as well as the repayment of loans underwritten by banks and investment companies . Britain will pay more than five times that amount under the terms of the PFIs used to create them and in some cases be left with nothing to show for it because the PFI agreed to is effectively a leasing agreement . Some 16388bn has already been spent and even if the projected cost between now and 204950 does not change the total PFI bill will be in excess of 163310bn . This is more than four times the budget deficit used to justify austerity cuts to government budgets and local services . The total cost will likely rise far above the initial 163222billion cost of these deals 8212 and the total cost is likely to rise far beyond that amount . Privatization of water systems has not gone better
---  South Korean President Moon Jaein's approval rating has dropped to 67 percent Gallup Korea said in a press release down from last week . The president8217s specific moves to bring together the two Koreas at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics have sparked a sharp public backlash that has gone beyond his traditional conservative detractors to include his main support base of young South Koreans . Moon was elected to office in May last year with a high approval rating after his predecessor Park Geunhye was removed from office over a corruption scandal . The victory could embolden Viktor Orban to put more muscle into a Central European alliance against EU migration policies working with other rightwing nationalists in Poland and Austria and further expose cracks in the 28nation European Union . Orban could use his sweeping new political mandate to extend Hungary8218s crackdown on civil organizations that have been critical of his antiimmigration policies . The rightwing nationalist projected himself as a savior of Hungary 8217s Christian culture against Muslim migration into Europe an image which resonated with over 25 million voters especially in rural areas His Fidesz party won a twothirds majority for the third time straight time in Sunday's election meaning he has the powers to change constitutional laws .

The Secretary General more than any single person should know that there is specific authorization Specifically Security Council resolutions 678 687 and 1441 . The French President Jacques Chirac reiterated this view several times and effectively ended the use of the Security Council as an arena for negotiating some kind of settlement to that conflict . Ambassador Kevin E Moley says that this is an egregious misstatement of the facts of our going to war in Iraq . Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick says that the French created deep divisions when they announced that they would veto any resolution which was passed by the . Security Council that dealt with the question of use of . use of force in Iraq at that time The French president Jacques Chorac reiterated that view . Moley: We are not in fact in fact delimiting the mandate from the original resolution from the . original resolution . Even though the subject of the crimes of the . crimes of Saddam Hussein has been replaced with the subject that were the crimes that have been replaced by the subject rapporteur, even though the crimes were the subject  The United States has a very large interest in having the evidence concerning the crimes against humanity of the Saddam Hussein regime preserved and investigated . Ambassador says that the situation is still quite fluid . Ambassador: There should be no question in the mind of the Secretary General that we need to make any clearer than we already have and have been on the record repeatedly as being in conformance with the Geneva Conventions the Hague etc. But there are a lot of countries on the Commission who are only on the .

---  Sallyport Global was paid nearly 700 million in federal contracts to secure Balad Air Base home to a squadron of F16 fighter jets as part of the USled coalition to annihilate the Islamic State . Investigators Robert Cole and Kristie King were fired without explanation less than two months ago . They uncovered evidence that Sallyport employees were involved in sex trafficking and other misconduct at Balad and beyond . Sallyport said it follows all contracting rules at the base . The company said that the investigators misinterpreted the instructions in a call with Sallyport lawyers they said they were advised to keep two sets of books about potential crimes and contract violations . The Pentagon auditors who were frequently on the base were not told of the serious problems until early this year a potential violation of law The Pentagon Auditors reports detail dozens of more minor infractions . The gap illustrates the limits of US oversight for billions of dollars in contracts run by companies that have cashed in on the fight to protect Americans from extremism and corruption going back to the Sept 11 attacks going to protect U.S. The Defense Department declined to comment The AP declined to say whether or not they were aware of the problems at the Balad base is not aware of any major infractions that went unreported until this year .  Iraqi pilots today landed the 1st squadron of Iraqi F16s in Iraq8221 he wrote The first security breach came in less than 24 hours A long black skid mark on the tarmac was reported It stopped about 45 yards from the nose of one of the fighter jets . A truck had plowed through a rope barrier in the 8220nogo8221 zone where lethal force is authorized to protect the planes . Cole says the outofcontrol truck was a harbinger . Cole uncovered a plot by three Iraqi Sallyport staff working with a dangerous Iranbacked militia known as Kataib Imam Ali . The Shiite militia was an ongoing headache politically connected and operating outside the law with sidelines in theft and gunrunning It has ties to the leader of the umbrella militia Popular Mobilization Forces which is on the US list of designated terrorists . The prime suspect threatened to join the militia during his interrogation He was a Sallyport bodyguard In fact the investigators later found a photo of him on his Facebook page dressed in black militia garb and a patch indicating his allegiance to the group . In one instance they had passed around a bowlful of gummy bears soaked in vodka in Baghdad . The investigators got a tipleggers in two hotels of two hotels in Baghdad
---  In times of war even liberal democracies adopt measures infringing human rights in ways that are wholly disproportionate to the crisis . In the name of fighting terrorism President Bush and his administration have abruptly overridden rights protected by the Constitution and international law . The Bush administration is really attacking a basic premise of the American system that we have a government under law It was a novel idea when James Madison Alexander Hamilton laid it down at the end of the 18th century and ever since it has been a distinctive feature of our polity . The administration8217s policy in one instance after another has been to avoid any accounting before the law It has tried to prevent the prisoners it holds as possibly connected to terrorism in Guantanamo and elsewhere from testing in court whether in fact they have anything to do with terrorism . It has covered its actions in secrecy which is the enemy of legal and political accountability . Aliens have been the most numerous victims of the administration 8217s methods but not the only ones . Oppressive tactics used against aliens have been directed against American citizens too in the past . The danger of what is happening is more profound than the denial of justice to some individuals . The alarm bells of American liberty should be sounding in a perilous state wounded by Lord Steyn . It is not just for Guantanamo  The brief that describes the British detainees is a remarkable document . It concerns one aspect of the Guantanamo detentions the determination of the Bush administration to keep the prisoners from having their situations reviewed by any court . The administration declined to follow this convention and declared unilaterally that everyone held in Guantanamo was an 8220unlawful combatant8221 not entitled to the rights of a prisoner of war . The right to challenge his detention before a tribunal of the kind required by the Geneva Convention is not a legal abstraction It has acute human consequences that became clear when the United States at the end of January released three teenagers who had been in Guantanamo for more than a year . The Bush administration has used similar methods against US citizens and its lawyers argue that citizens have no greater protection of their freedom . Two citizens have been held without trial for over 20 months imprisoned in solitary confinement in Navy brigs subjected to unending interrogation and denied the right to consult lawyers . At least 21 prisoners have attempted suicide in the U.S. Government said that it was not deciding what the president could do with someone arrested inside this country that is not the case of Jose Padilla . The US Su preme Court agreed to decide whether the administration has the power it claims to detain citizens without trial
---  Dr Sami AlArian one of the earliest victims of the 8220war on terror8221 within the US itself continues to languish in jail where he has been since his February 2003 arrest for speaking out on behalf of the Palestinian struggle against Israel8217s apartheid . His daughter Laila has sought a meeting with Sen Patrick Leahy a leading Democrat and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee . Leahy has refused to investigate the circumstances and conditions under which Dr AlArians is being held in jail . Laila is the author with Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist Chris Hedges of Collateral Damage America 8217s War Against Iraqi Civilians 1 . She recently joined AlJazeera English as a producer and recently joined a producer . She spoke with Laila on her recent visit to Burlington Vt where she sought a meet with Senator Leahy to seek a meeting to meet with Leahy . She said that Leahy is refusing to look into the circumstances of her father's imprisonment under which he was held in prison under the terms of a plea agreement . The trial will take place August 13 August 13 for the trial of criminal contempt which is scheduled to take place on August 13 and will be August 13 September 13 . The case is expected to begin August 13 .  Patrick Leahy's father has been moved from the US marshal8217s custody to ICE custody . Leahy had a chance for almost the past two years to get involved and he didn8217t . The jury in Florida concluded that my father's only socalled crime was exercising his First Amendment rights . I think that as head of the Senate Judiciary Committee he has the responsibility to oversee what the Bush Justice Department is doing Leahy has . I THINK it's just the same policies of this Bush administration Bush went out of his way to say that this isn't a war on Islam and Muslims but I think the past almost eight years have shown otherwise They targeted someone like my father who was an activist who just spoke his mind I think few American people know about the effects of the war on Afghan civilians . Obama should consider a credible peacebroker in the Middle East if you will actually consider all sides and consider an all-separate relationship with Israel while suggesting he would negotiate an agreement between the two sides in the Mideast and the Palestinians while suggesting an agreement with Israel and the U.S. would be a credible alternative to an Obama presidency I think it would be the only way to be credible and the only credible way to negotiate .
---  Vice President Mike Pence is back on the show to talk about the status of the bill in the Senate . Obamacare is putting a tremendous burden on working families on small businesses on the American economy . The president and I are absolutely determined to roll our sleeves up and work with the Senate to pass legislation that will repeal and replace Obamacare . The challenges have to do with the complexity of this disastrous policy launch and the best way for us to turn this national policy back in the direction of freedom But it all begins with elements of this bill Remember while this legislation doesn't do everything that we ultimately want to do, the president8217s committed to ultimately allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines the way they buy life insurance the way it buy car insurance RUSH. The House of Representatives has done its job. Obamacare is literally imploding before our eyes I mean Obamacare is actually imploding Before our eyes. Nobody is talking about that That’s a great point because nobody is talked about it. We have to pass this legislation. We8217ve got 52 votes plus yours if necessary if it comes down to that but the budget rules that we8217re using don’t allow us to make that kind of a substantive change in the law  There are three mandates that are in Obamacare and most people are only aware of two when you use the 8220mandate8221 term .

---  Andrea Arnold8217s Fish Tank tells the story of Mia a fifteen year old girl who lives in the council estates on the Essex borderlands . Andrea Arnold intentionally wanted the audience to feel the claustrophobic confines of class . She wanted to throw us inside the 8220fish tank8221 of the lower working class life in the British council estates public housing . The movie wraps its fingers around our throats and never lets go for the entire 123 minutes . The film is so real that I can only call it the stuff of life in an apartment I can call it miseensceneeneene . The story is not one of dramatic narrative arc or even a traditional coming of age story It is a life that is so tightly compressed by class and gender that there is no 8220coming of age8221 allowed since it is clear that Mia was in a sense born 8220grown up8221 The movie takes us through a window of Mia's life where she fights with her mother and her sister and her mother has hostile interactions with neighborhood girls attempts to free a horse . There is such little connection or communication between the mother and daughters . The characters are like a menacing specter of female sexuality gone from the presence of her presence in her family  Mia is the perfect embodiment of the tension that resides in young girls who are thrust into a grown up world . Mia's entire presence is as controlled and clenched as the movie itself and her neediness and vulnerability are expressed not through tears or selfpity but through compression and bursts of rage She adopts boyish clothing as a kind of suit of armor and adopts the dance moves of boys 8212 break dancing . Mia is trapped between the sexual yearning inside her and the necessity to consciously suppress her sexuality as an act of survival . Mia and Connor8217s relationship between play and sexuality fuels the tension and tightness of the movie . The irony that Mia rebels against her mother is that Mia is that that while Mia rebels is that while her mother has sex with Connor is that she rebels against the sex with sex with her mother . The only access she eventually has sexuality is through her mother and the overt overt overtaken sexuality is to her mother’s boyfriend . The film is utterly devastating not because it is so overtrophobic that makes the movie relentlessly claustrophobic and that makes it so intense it is utterly traumatic but it is overtly traumatic but so ordinary but so traumatic but that is so traumatic because it makes the film so ordinary .
---  EidulFitr is approaching festivities that will mark the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan are about to start . Some 20 percent of the world population which is Muslim is now cooking doing lastminute wrapping of the gifts getting ready to forgive the loved ones its neighbors and to disburse the charities . For some perhaps for the majority of Muslims that I know it is one important and beautiful event an opportunity to become better and more caring people I don't believe I have no religion and in many of my books and reports I have been arguing that all religions brought tremendous grief and suffering to the people inhabiting our planet But I have many Muslim friends Among Muslims are people that I care for immensely I am close to Muslim people who live in Indonesia Golf region SubContinent Africa Malaysia and elsewhere I had been a friend of Abdurrahman Wahid former Indonesian progressive President and the leader of the largest Muslim organization in the world 8211 NU Nahdlatul Ulama I regularly discuss Islam with Muslim clerics in Aceh and with Shia believers in Iran and India I have enormous respect for Muslim culture 8211 .

Many Muslims guard their feelings and their 8216territory8217 when interacting with infidels . West the ruling culture that shows limitless spite towards the Islamic cultural universe . West developed powerful set of uncompromising stereotypes there are two extremes on the scale of generally accepted measure of intellectualism . Most of my 8216intellectual8217 friends in Paris or Madrid or even New York could hardly name one Muslim thinker or one Middle Eastern poet . Most Western intellectuals have one extreme maybe the most extreme and believe in the belief that the West has some unquestionable mandate to rule over the Muslim lands . But let us go back to Muslims go back and let us save the world to go back, says author .

---  Legislation to renew federal funding to the government cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate and was expected soon to pass votes in Senate and House of Representatives allowing government to reopen through Feb 8 . Tens of thousands of federal workers had begun closing down operations for lack of funding on Monday the first weekday since the shutdown . The last US government shutdown was in 2013 but essential services such as security and defense operations had continued . The internal watchdog at the US Justice Department said on Wednesday he is launching a review into allegations by Republican lawmakers that the FBI made serious missteps when it sought a warrant to monitor a former adviser to President Donald Trump8217s 2016 election campaign . Trump is expected to sign the legislation which would give Congress more time to try to reach agreement on a longterm spending bill that would resolve issues including immigration border security and spending caps . Trump and Republicans accused Democrats of putting the interests of illegal immigrants ahead of US military personnel and government workers ahead of American military personnel . Markets have absorbed the shutdown drama over the last week and on Monday morning world stocks and US bond markets largely shrugged off the standoff .

The trend underscores how the Trump administration8217s broad crackdown on illegal immigration has sometimes had unintended consequences . Immigration judges can indefinitely shelve deportation cases of immigrants who have lived illegally for years in the United States but have not committed serious crimes and have strong family or other ties in the country . The practice became more common after the Obama administration instructed prosecutors in 2011 to prioritize immigration cases involving criminals . In the interim they can remain in the U.S. and often are eligible to work legally in the interim . The Obama administration added an average of 41000 cases to the backlog each year according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse TRAC a New Yorkbased research organization . In January Sessions announced he will review a recent decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals and consider whether judges should have authority to close cases . The backlog has grown by another estimated 145000 cases a 27 percent increase in the last year of Obama administration more than 56000 such cases were closed in the first year of the year after Donald Trump became president the trend was sharply reversed with about 20000

Trump tweets that the removal of Confederate Confederate statues is noxious historical nonsense . The more we know and understand the past the better we will be situated to alter history in decent and desirable ways . The Southern Confederacy was formed to preserve by any means necessary the vicious archracist torture and exploitation regime that was black chattel slavery . The Confederate symbols and statues are now under unprecedented antiracist scrutiny and have become major whitesupremacist rallying points .

---  Two Sacramento police officers responding to a report of someone shattering car windows killed Stephon Alonzo Clark 22 on Sunday in a hail of bullets .

Police video has shown the officers chasing Clark around the side of his grandparents8217 house yelling 8220Show me your hands8221 and 8220Gun8221 before firing Police said they believed Clark held a gun but it turned out to be a mobile phone . Clark could have assumed police were in the area because a Sacramento County Sheriff's Department helicopter was circling overhead, police spokeswoman said . Police guidelines posted on the department8217s website do not specify that officers must identify themselves when encountering suspects Sacramento police spokeswoman Linda Matthew said she did not believe such a policy existed .

---  Cyber criminals attack ICOs 100 times a month on average a report said underscoring the risks of investing in cryptocurrency ventures online . Research published by Moscowbased cyber security firm GroupIB on Wednesday was based on an analysis of 450 attacks on ICOs since the beginning of 2017 . Attempts by hackers to steal money from ICO projects increased tenfold over the period GroupIB also took part in a study published this week by Ernst ampamp Young which showed that roughly 400 million of the 37 billion raised via ICOs to date had been stolen . Findings come amid a cryptocurrency investing craze with young companies raising hundreds of millions of dollars online to fund projects with often little more than a handful of employees and an outline business plan . There is also growing scrutiny from regulators and investors some of whom say they have been misled or defrauded via ICO schemes . US and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the consulting firm gained access to the data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users raising questions about consumer privacy concerns about the firm Cambridge Analytica and its privacy issues . Facebook FBO shares closed down nearly 7 percent on Monday wiping nearly 40 billion off its market value as investors worried that damage to the reputation of the world would deter users and advertisers .  Cambridge Analytica may have improperly gained access to data on 50 million Facebook users according to a Channel 4 television report . UK Information Commissioner is seeking a warrant to search the offices of the political consultancy . Facebook said it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analyticas still had the data . The auditors were in Cambridge Analytics' offices on Monday night but left at the request of the British authorities . The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds 700,000 but will gain the power to fine an organization up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May . Facebook shares closed down nearly 70 percent on Monday wiping nearly 40 billion off its market value as investors worried that new legislation could damage the company's advertising business .

---  Before long we will be hearing a lot of talk about 8220legitimation crises8221 . The problem with Trump is not that he lost the popular vote but won the election . The world would have been better off had more been made of the legitimacy of the way he got into the White House letting the issue go emboldened him Tweet by tweet it becomes harder to deny that Trump8217s ways of thinking and acting defy rational reconstruction . Trump is so plainly unfit for the office the Electoral College handed him 8211 temperamentally and intellectually that circumstances could arise that would cause a sizeable portion of the Trump base to turn against him . The Israeli government is obsessed with what America or Israel pretends to be the fifty-first state or pretends with it as if it were America to be as it were to be in Israel or to be pretends it were in the U.S. The American media is also pretends that it were the best they can as well to be a fifty-fifty-fiftift state or even the point that even he would have to wonder what is in staying on cable news but it is also an issue of what is expected to be about it as it regards to what regards to it as Israel .  Israel did not even exist at the time that the Judeocide was underway and the harm that the Nazis unleashed befell Jews living in Europe not Palestine . The state of Israel inherited a seemingly inexhaustible supply of moral capital to take over and ethnically cleanse Palestine . In historically Muslim countries and in most other parts of the world public opinion has always tended to support the Palestinian cause . Palestinian calls for justice are finally finding politically receptive audiences in North America Europe and Australasia . But Israel8217s rightwing governments have overplayed their hand so often and so egregiously that the process is at last no longer advancing at the glacial pace it was Founded twelve years ago in response to a call from leading organizations and figures in Palestinian civil society the BDS movement is therefore on the rise . With the Netanyahu government leading the way they are calling in every political favor they can in order to put the movement down . The Netanyahu government is also doing their best to intimidate BDS proponents and intimidate the movement . The regime in place in Israel now would surely horrify leading figures from earlier versions of the Zionist project but the internal stability of the regime is secure altogether . Israel's real or purported problem with political legitimacy is of a different nature altogether altogether. The regime
---  On Sept 19 eight days after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington Senator Frank Murkowski took to the Senate floor to deny reports that he was trying to attach an amendment containing one of his pet proposals to a fastmoving defense bill . Murkowski a Republican from Alaska said he resented any suggestion he was exploiting a national military emergency to slip through a measure that would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ANWR to energy exploration and development . Hours later one of Murkowski's key allies in the Senate introduced an amendment that Murkowski had written six months earlierto permit drilling for oil and natural gas in ANWR . The amendment was ultimately removed from the defense appropriations bill but Murkowski vowed to attach what he now called the 8220Homeland Energy Security Act8221 to other legislation Murkowski was not the only elected official trying to slip industrybacked items into unrelated emergency measures . In the wake of Sept 11 scores of Capitol Hill lawmakers rushed to repackage their old proposals in national security wrapping them up in the national security wrap them up with national security . Washington lobbyists trade associations and interest groups rushed to re-use old proposals as well as re-lobbying them in the aftermath of the terror attacks to advance a farmsubsidy bill .  The feeding frenzy was kicked off by the airline industry8217s drive for a fasttrack bailout in the days immediately after the terrorist attacks . Success of the airlines inspired the insurance industry to follow suit . 16 insurance executives told President George Bush and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans that the industry would be able to pay all the claimsestimated at 40 billion to 75 billion . The White House was quick to respond to the industry's request On October 15 it unveiled a plan to cap insurance industry's liability in 2002 by agreeing to use public funds to pay the first 100 billion in future terrorismrelated claims . Plan to shift the cost of any future terrorist attacks to taxpayers later stalled in the Senate but the early successes of the airline and insurance industries emboldened other businesses to think big . In November the House voted along party lines to approve the plan which had been introduced as the 8220Terrorism Risk Protection Act8221 by Rep Michael Oxley a Republican from Ohio . The plan would also limit the industry’s liability to 23 billion in 2003 and 35 billion in 2004 in 2004 . The National Limousine Association tried to arrange an exemption from its members members of its members on its members of the General aviation industry to exempt its members from its own fleets from its membership .

They were also deprived of funds for any international travel .

This was Sovietstyle justice imposed after the fact because the leadership didn't like it . Chris Smith has put forth a Resolution of Conscience . It will take fifty signatures in order for this to be debated by the entire Republican conference . Congressman Mark Neumann of Wisconsin said it exactly right Congressman Neumann said it is a matter of conscience8221. We have changed the form of government we have without the consent of the governed. It took the Democrats forty years to become as arrogant as we have become in a year and a half8221 And that is exactly what this is about Congressman Smith said it was exactly right. Congressman Smith has said that any member is free to follow his or her conscience in order to debate by the whole Republican conference. He has said it will take 50 signatures in .

---  FDR8217s New Deal laid the basis for what Henry Luce of Time Magazine called the American Century less than a century but more than fifty years of American supremacy A New New Deal Today as the nation once again confronts an economic crisis some are turning to look back at the New Deal in the hope of finding a solution to our country's current problems . The Nation recently asked a dozen prominent Americans including Rev Jesse Jackson SEIU President Andy Stern and historian Howard Zinn to comment on FDR's New Deal on its anniversary . We find that there was another path a road not taken an alternative for the country which we might pursue today. What we need today is not a New Deal but a different sort of coalition under different leadership and with altogether different objectives a Different Deal. We need to find a different way forward for America in the 1930s. The Crash and the Depression set America8217’s working people in motion. The New Deal set America 8217s Working People in motion . The Crash of 1929 set America’S working people into motion. It set America into a working class revolution through a new labor movement. It was driven by the working class revolutions. It resulted from the mass movements of farmers and workers to contain the interplay between  Roosevelt realized that if he was to succeed in reforming and reconstructing American capitalism he would have to broaden the social base of the Democratic Party . FDR was constructing a new coalition that included Rockefeller8217s Chase National Bank and other nonMorgan banks . FDR also worked to expand his coalition by incorporating more plebeian forces . Roosevelt succeeded in expanding the Democratic party to include industrialists from the capitalintensive force of the CIO unions . He also succeeded in bringing into his coalition the Congress of Industrial Organizations with its new unions made up of millions of immigrant and African American workers . Roosevelt however refused to reach out to African Americans believing that he could not even appear to sympathize with them . Some believe that Roosevelts New Deal ended the Great Depression but that was not the end of the war for the United States . By 1938 unemployment levels had risen once again to nearly 20 percent had risen to almost 20 percent in the U.S. by the leading case for the same war for war for Roosevelt. By 1938, unemployment had not once again brought the country out of the depression by the same case . Roosevelt's New Deal had not ended the great war for War for the World War in the case that had begun for the great case had ended the war .

---  I began teaching a class of 28 prisoners at a maximumsecurity prison in New Jersey during the first week of September . Each week the students were required to write dramatic scenes based on their experiences in and out of prison . The students were able to portray in dramatic scenes and dialogue the horror of being locked in cages for years . The mass incarceration of primarily poor people of color people who seldom have access to adequate legal defense and who are often kept behind bars for years for nonviolent crimes or for crimes they did not commit is one of the most shameful mass injustices committed in the U.S. The 28 men in my class have cumulatively spent 515 years in prison Some of their sentences are utterly disproportionate to the crimes of which they are accused Most are not even close to finishing their sentences or coming before a parole board which rarely grants firsttime applicants their liberty . One of my students was arrested at the age of 14 for a crime that strong evidence suggests he didn't commit He will not be eligible for parole until he is 70 He never had a chance in court and because he cannot afford a private attorney he has no chance now of challenging the grotesque sentence handed to him as a child . The title they chose was 8220Caged, 8220  There are 80000 US prisoners held in solitary confinement which human rights organizations such as Amnesty International define as a form of torture .

---  The New York Times editorial team in Venezuela is generally not in favor of term limits . Hugo Ch225vez is the most popular democraticallyelected leader in the Western Hemisphere . He should abandon his good push to change the Constitution so that he can run for a third term in 2013 . The paper had previously insisted that any change to term limits come through popular referendum . It now reverses this view taking the position that for reasons of political expediency a simple vote in the small executive council will do . The Times has a long history of opposing term limits dating from ancient Greece and Rome and Aristotle's concept of ruling and being ruled in turn . Ch225Venezuela should heed the message that Venezuelans don't want to give Mr Ch225 Chavez even more power to give more power, says the paper . It is the paper’s editorial team. The lesson from Sunday is that Venezuelan voters don’t want to ‘grabbing constitutional reform” is that they don”t want ‘powergrabbing’. It is that the paper is that it is not to give Ch225Hugo Ch225“grabbing power”. The paper is a “power grabbing” of the powergrabbing  Ch225vez must leave because he is evil and Uribe should choose to do so because he's great, says the New York Times . Uribe was described as 8220a close personal friend of Pablo Escobar8230 dedicated to collaboration with the Medell237n cartel a high government levels . He accused the Supreme Court of being politically motivated after it started investigating dozens of his Congressional allies for alleged ties to rightwing paramilitaries . He has now proposed reforms that would remove the investigation of members of Congress from Supreme Court8217s jurisdiction . As Sunday's referendum vote approaches all indications are that it enjoys the support of a clear and increasing majority of the Venezuelan electorate . If the western and opposition media is to be believed the idea of lifting term limits in Venezuela has already been defeated in an election namely the constitutional reform effort that was narrowly voted down in December of 2007 but this is simply incorrect, says Juan Carlos Vargas . The more independent Venezuelan Data Analysis Institute has surprisingly given a more significant margin of victory to the vote at 546 versus 455 against the margin of more points separating the margin separating the two two . In recent weeks it comes as a surprise from the Los Angeles Times had just had a full 3 points in December which had just
---  The past 18 months have been a crash course in things we never knew existed but that we are told have already done us all irreparable harm . Business press assumes a tone of rueful omniscience as in this late2007 New York Times piece on regulatory laxity under Alan Greenspan . The demise of the mainstream media especially newspapers has been forecast for decades but the years following the tech wreck of 2000 have been hard hit . Since 2004 Washington Post has been hardhit especially Washington Post especially the business news . Businesses have lost 25 percent to 30 percent to business pages of the country since 2000 . In newspapers, the credit crisis made it commonplace it was the business model that fell apart . In Newspapers have lost more than 99 percent to the credit model that made it worth remembering the credit industry made it hard to remember it was worth remembering it was hard to make it worth worth the credit it was a business flameout. In newspapering itself that fell out of business flameouts. Since 2000 Business News Initiative at the North Carolina University of North Carolina News Initiative has lost its business model. Since 2004, the drip of business news has become a business model fell apart and became a deluge of news news became a hard-hit business .  Journal executive Penelope Muse Abernathy says the late1990s economic expansion fed a virtuous cycle in which profits funded good journalism that would attract more readers and profit . Journal executive says Wall Street coverage tilted toward personalitydriven stories not deconstructing balance sheets or figuring out risks . Journal despite occasional bright spots became rote formulaic dull The disintegration of the financial media8217s own financial underpinnings could not have come at a worse time . Journal has done some fine work but in no sense did it dominate the crisis story as the Journal dominated core financial stories in the past . Journal's experimentation cutting back the copy desk revamping sections8212has not helped the journalism, says former reporter Jesse Eisinger a former financial columnist for Portfolio says the paper like business journalism generally clung to outdated formulas Wall Street writer says paper generally clings to outdated formulaic formulas . In 2002 Gretchen Morgenson won a Pulitzer for beat reporting on Wall Street beating singlehandedly in the Wall Street beat singlehandedly, says Portfolio writer .

---  South Africa is only now beginning to emerge from the worst cholera outbreak in its history a plague of almost epic proportions that began two years ago just weeks after local authorities began shutting off water service to residents who were late on their bills . The government adopted a conservative fiscal measure known as 8220cost recovery8221 which requires public services such as water electricity and telecommunications to pay for themselves often through increased fees it also encourages turning those utilities over to private companies . Nearly a quarter of South Africa's 44 million people live in 44 million households that live in Empangeni, 44 million in South Africa, that live with 44 million of those that live without jobs . About 11 billion people worldwide lack access to clean water and dwindling supplies could push that number even higher in years to come 8220There8217s a global water crisis and at the same time water is being increasingly commodified8221 says Vandana Shiva founder of the Research Foundation for Science Technology and Ecology in India . The UN World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg last summer delegates designated water as one of the key issues facing poor countries with water as a key issue facing poor nations . The U.N. delegates designated Water as one issue facing water as an issue for poor countries  Nearly 260 South Africans have died from cholera since the epidemic began in South Africa . Cholera was so rampant that hospitals in and around Empangeni opened 14 hydration centers tents where medics worked in 24hour shifts to provide fluids to patients . Since 1994 the African National Congress government has dramatically closed the gap between prosperous whites and poor blacks . But like the water that flows through Mbabe the ANC8217s policies have been both a blessing and curse to poor South Africans who have overwhelmingly supported the governing party . New pricing policies have caused electricity costs in townships like Soweto to rise by as much as 400 percent . Johannesburg Water Management Company inherited an apartheidera white elephant known as the Lesotho Highlands Water Project which has already caused the cost of water in Johannesburg to nearly triple since the anc came to power . In 2001 the city entered into a partnership with Suez and some of its subsidiaries 8212 despite the fact that Suez tendered the lowest bid . The project is partially financed by international loans that will be repaid by the World Bank and other international lenders who will be paid by the passing of the cost on consumers of residents of Alexandra . The deal is partially funded by international lenders .

Newt Gingrich expresses outrage in multiple statements over the next month Newt Gingrich says there should be no near Ground Zero mosque in long as long as there are no churches or synues in Saudi Arabia in long-as-long-as long as Saudi Arabia . The movement against the project is clearly aggressive and that building the site of the mosque is clearly offensive and that it would be like putting a Nazi sign next to the 911 attacks attacks on 911 attacks on the Holocaust Museum .  On August 13 President Obama hosts representatives of the Muslim community at the White House . Mitt Romney8217s spokesman adds 8220Governor Romney opposes the construction of the mosque at Ground Zero . A Republican running for Congress in Maryland Andrew Harris denounces the statement 8220 He is thinking like a lawyer and not an American making declarations without America's best interest in mind . A CNN poll published in August 11 shows 68 of Americans opposed to the center and a FOX poll published August 13 shows that 61 of US residents support the legal right to construct Park 51 but 64 don’t want the Muslim group to construct it . The charge seems based solely on the fact that in a June 2010 interview with Aaron Klein of New York82BC Radio he declined to say whether he agreed with the listing of Hamas as a 8220terrorist organization8221 He declined to do replying 8217s WABC Radio . The State Dept. has considered it a terrorist organization 822 terrorist organization822 The U.S. considers Hamas as an Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands to be removed from its blacklist in 2003 under pressure from the European Union only added it in 1994 but it is highly political and arbitrary oversight . Many have asked that it should be removed under US pressure .
---  The Israeli Wallthe socalled security fence173 is a daunting and ominous matrix of social control and demographic separation that is currently planned to be 670 km long . The wall dramatically alters the conditions of life in the Occupied Territories of Palestine by establishing and consolidating a set of territorial arrangements that attempts to physically ensure that most of the existing and illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza are there to stay . The Wall the construction of began in June 2002 has severely disrupted and profoundly encumbered daily life It has undermined and wretchedly destroyed the social and economic fabric Palestinian civil society to make room for its path .

---  Belmont Cragin has undergone a quiet but dramatic change in the last decade . Once mostly made up of Polish Americans it is now a predominantly Latino neighborhood . Residents say the transition has gone smoothly unlike in Chicago neighborhoods that shifted from white to black in the 1960s and 1970s . Some residents are upset that singlefamily homes have been illegally converted into apartments and rooms for lowincome renters . Some worry about neighborhood crime and associate it with young people who have moved into the area .

Crime is also a major complaint among Latino residents Carmen Martinez and Carmen Martinez who moved to the neighborhood in 1990 doesn8217t want to see the quality of life decline there . Police say gentrification has pushed criminal activity into the Wicker Park Park and parts of the southeast community . The district has set up task forces to hold up up up and hold down on cracking down on crack down on the problem on crack spots and keep it from getting out of control and keeping it out of the problem of cracking down . The area has nearly doubled its youth population since 1990 to 23298 now makes up about 30 percent of the total of the area to make up for the 30 percent .
---  Western powers have no plans for further missile strikes on Syria but will assess their options if Damascus uses chemical weapons again Britain8217s foreign minister said on Sunday as debate raged over legality and effectiveness of the raids . Russia's deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad met inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW for about three hours in the presence of Russian officers and a senior Syrian security official .

---  The 2014 polar vortex and the wave of cold weather unleashed over much of the US has surfaced again and again as proponents have made the case for one of Virginias most controversial infrastructure projects the Dominion Energyled Atlantic Coast Pipeline . Opponents say Dominion is recycling an old argument that ignores other factors that lead to service curtailments and contend that building a 55 billion new pipeline is the most expensive way to deal with demand spikes caused by cold weather . The 600mile pipeline would run from West Virginia through Virginia and into North Carolina with a spur to Hampton Roads . It would provide a reserve margin for these cold winter days and provide additional capacity for industrial expansion . The company said its customers used more energy during the first week of January than any on record . The recent cold weather was not quite as severe as the polar vortex of 2014 which caused forced outages because of a range of factors including inadequate fuel supplies and mechanical problems including lack of insulation of crucial components freezing coal piles and mechanical failures .

The system delivered a record amount of gas  FERC has issued certificates for both projects 8212 though in a rare dissent one commissioner said she could not conclude that either pipeline was in the public interest . Opponents contend the project is more about the 14 percent rate of return guaranteed by the FERC with utility ratepayers bearing all the risk . Dominion has argued that the pipelines will provide supply diversity that will hedge against price shocks by allowing utilities to purchase gas from different geographical sources 8212 .

The same argument that existing pipeline capacity is stretched to the max during periods of severe weather reared its head again a few weeks ago after a similar spate of plunging temperatures ushered in 2018 ushered in the mid-season cold weather has reared in 2018 .

---  California healthcare workers are fighting for the right to have a union of their own a union that they control and that works in their interests not in this case the SEIU . The new National Union of Healthcare Workers NUHW made an historic advance 8211 it filed petitions asking that the National Labor Relations Board NLRB conduct decertification rescind legal recognition of legal recognition at Kaiser Permanente the nation8217s largest nonprofit health care provider . These petitions were signed by more than 50 per cent that is an absolute majority of all California 8217s 50000 of Kaiser8217's SEIU represented healthcare workers . The petitions represent starkly the desire of these healthcare workers to leave SEIU This petition campaign is the culmination of one phase in what has been conducted entirely by healthcare workers themselves and the fired former elected staff of UHWamp160 This campaign is all the more striking given that this campaign has been done entirely by Healthcare workers themselves . The petition campaign was collected in less than one month by working health care workers seeking recognition . The crisis in California SEIU came to a head on January 27 2009 when Andy Stern the International President of SEIU placed UHw in trusteeship He replaced the entire elected leadership of UUHwamp160  The NLRB is the agency within the United States government charged with conducting elections for labor union representation and with investigating charges of unfair labor practices . The agency8217s origins in the 1930s lie in the National Labor Relations Act the New Deal Wagner Act 1935 that made trade unionism legal though it has rarely lived up to its prolabor reputation . At best it has offered a cumbersome and timeconsuming process for defending workers8217 rights at worst it has reflected the politics of the party in power . Today EFCA is an attempt to remedy these failings by amendingamp160 the NLRA 8211 in the hope of making it easier for workers to form join or assist labor organizations . The Employee Free Choice Act is now before Congress is organized labor8217 . It would simplify efforts by workers to unionize and negotiate first contracts and provide for penalties for unfair labor practice particularly in organizing efforts . EFCa is of course vehemently opposed byamp160 business because it would simplify efforts by the employers to simplify efforts .

No team has ever won more than five MW road games in a season . The Rams are playing better on the road right now than they are at home where they8217re just 32 in league play . When they play at home the Rams are still going to classes and study hall sessions during the day .

---  Conservative Reforms for a Limited Government and a Thriving Middle Class 8203 . The liberal welfare state ultimately cannot be had at an affordable price . Conservatives must instead help the public see that the agenda they offer is rooted not just in fiscal concerns but in a political moral and social vision much better aligned with the realities of American life and the character of Americans8217 aspirations . The fundamentally prescriptive technocratic approach to American society inherent in the logic of the Left8217s policy thinking is a poor fit for American life at any scale . Progressives in America have always viewed those mediating institutions that stand in the individual and the state with suspicion seeing them as instruments of prejudice and selfishness . They empower the government to rationalize the life vestiges and policies by clearing away those programs by putting in their public programs in their place and putting their policies in their own place . The idea is motivated by cohesive understanding of the public interest and policies motivated by public interest, YG Network 8217s new essay collection. In each idea is to advance the idea to act as public utilities or offer large corporations willing to act to advance policy goals to large corporations or advance protection to large firms willing to advance policies to advance their own interests to large  Conservatives have always resisted gross rationalization of society and insisted that local knowledge channeled by evolved social institutions 8212 will make for better material outcomes and a better common life . Conservatives tend to think society is much too complicated to be amenable to consolidated technical solutions that assume we already have all the answers and just seek to impose them . Conservatives believe that longevolved decentralized social institutions are more likely to be able to help all citizens take part in them and that public policy should help . This involves not fabled past but modernization of our antiquated lumbering lumbering bureaucracy 21stcentury governing institutions that enables a leaner and more responsive government to help a complex 21st century society . By recovering animating animating principles of American government we can overcome the flabby lethargy of the welfare state of the progressive welfare state, we seek social and economic problems for which we seek economic and social solutions for which problems require us to balance the social and educational needs of a vast array of diverse students in the vast array and responsive 21ststcentury society . We need to balance competing needs in the complex array of educational and affordable care and affordable schools in which we need to provide high quality instruction that meets the needs of students in a vast range of diverse

The ENOUGH National School Walkout was intended to pressure federal and state lawmakers to tighten laws on gun ownership despite opposition by the National Rifle Association NRA . Many school districts gave their blessings to the walkouts others said anyone who participated would face discipline . Students from more than 2800 schools and groups joined the event many with the backing of their school districts according to the event organizers who also coordinated the event . The studentled initiative helped bring about a tightening of Florida8217s gun laws last week when the minimum age of 21 for buying any handguns was extended to all firearms . But lawmakers rejected a ban on the sort of semiautomatic rifle used in the sortiautomist rifle used used in Parkland attack but lawmakers rejected proposals to strengthen the backgroundcheck system for gun sales among other measures .

---  Marx argued that capitalism and class began as dispossession as the foundation of class formation and grievance figured forcefully and where Marx displayed his broadest class struggle sensibilities . Marx had considerable empathy for the dispossessed in his condemnation of the treatment of the paupers and pincers . Marx grasped how capitalism was a socioeconomic war among class antagonists . The revolution of masses of humanity was central to class formation in Marx's writings of the 1840s where dispossession was a foundation for class formation . The proletariat is not therefore defined by the wage relation itself but defined by dispossession 8212 the brutal process by which producers are forced to depend on the wage for survival . Marx insisted the workers of workers and workers were not the product of capitalism as a class system but rather the result of their struggle for supremacy for supremacy in the society . The workers of society are not the products of capitalist society as they are exploited for supremacy. Marx insisted that the workers were a product of class struggle. The workers do not exist for political economy but they are not products of the capitalist society. The class struggle only exists for political purposes. The workingman does not recognize the unemployed worker the workingman as he happens to be part of the class. The unemployed worker. In the Economic Economy  Dispossession the basis of all proletarianization sustains accumulation which further intensifies the process of expropriation and all of this in turn produces relentless class struggle . Henry Mayhew's writings on London labor and the poor emerged at roughly the same time as commentaries of Marx and Engels emphasized how the capitalist labor market was characterized by dispossession . Mayhew concluded that regular employment was available to roughly 15 million laborers while halftime work might accrue to a further 15 million with 15 million more either wholly unemployed or working occasionally only by displacing those who considered specific jobs to be their terrain . In this way slave rebellions plebeian uprisings, peasant revolts and bread riots can all be placed alongside the revolutions of the nineteenthcentury such as the upheavals of 1848 and 1871 as well as those of the twentieth century starting with the Russian Revolution in 1917 starting with Russia in 1917 . The fight that each time ended either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending classes8221 Eamp160P Thompson8217s The Making of the English Working Class nevertheless argued that it was indeed a working class formed in the cauldron of the Industrial Revolution and the 179082111832 counterrevolution of property
---  Alan Greenspan is responsible for flooding the housing market with trillions of dollars in low interest credit creating the largest equity bubble in history . Greenspan has hit the road and now spends his time leapfrogging from city to city hawking his revisionist memoirs of how he steered the ship of state through troubled waters while fending off protectionist liberals . Still can we really blame Greenspan 8220Maestro for what appears to have been a spontaneous flurry of 8220free market8221 speculation in real estate to a large extent yes Apart from Greenspan's tacit endorsement of all the dubious loans subprime ARMs etc which flourished during his reign and despite his brusque rejection of the Fed8217s role as regulator the Federal Reserve has rejected the Fed . Low interest rates continue to be the most efficient way of stealthily shifting wealth from one class to another while decimating the foundations of a healthy economy . California housing bubble has sprung a leak and is careening towards earth . The future of the future of mortgagedebt is very much in doubt now. The banks are no longer able to bundle loans into securities and sell them to investors in the banks are using the banks to cover bad bets on bad mortgage loans . The banks have changed the basic dynamics  Fed has provided more than 400 billion in repos since the August meltdown and yet the troubles persist . Treasury Dept has joined with Citigroup Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase in an attempt to repackage bad debts and sell them to wary investors via 8220Super conduit8221 mega fund . The desperation is palpable and these latest shenanigans are only adding to rising stock market jitters . The banking system is overextended and undercapitalized The Fed cannot get money to the people who need it and who can keep the economy dependent on consumer spending growing This is a structural problem and it cannot be resolved by merely cutting rates . We8217ve already begun to see signs of a slowdown in consumer spending at Target Lowes and Walmart If that deceleration continues the economy will slip quickly into recession . Deflation is the Fed8217s worst nightmare and will be fought with every weapon in their arsenal Regrettably Bernanke does not have the tools to fix this problem and he is likely to destroy the currency if he keeps cutting rates If he continues cutting rates he will destroy the dollar if he continues to keep cutting rates, the Fed does not know how much payments will increase the housing bubble is beginning to show up in other areas of the economy
---  Michael Krawitz founder and curator of the Cannabis Museum has obtained via ebay a promotional booklet attesting to the widespread medical use of cannabis in the US a century ago . The handsomely designed and printed 16page booklet was published by Parke Davis ampamp Co to market its 8220Cannabis Americana8221 to doctors and pharmacists . The booklet will describe the drug's physiological action as that of Cannabis Indica . Cannabis Americana will be found equally as efficient as and perhaps more uniformly reliable than cannabis Indica obtained from abroad since it is evident that with a source of supply at our very doors proper precautions can be taken to obtain crude drug of the best quality8221 . The effects of this drug are said to be due chiefly to its action upon the central nervous system . It is of use in cases of migraine particularly when opium is contraindicated. It is recommended in paralysis agitans to quiet the tremors in spasm of the bladder and in sexual impotence not the result of organic disease especially in combinations with nux vomica and ergotum . The dosage of Cannabis America is 1 minimally dosage of 1 minimc 1 gramme 15 grain Fluidec 1min 1min Cae 1min .  In order that the drug may be rapidly absorbed food should be withheld 24 hours before the test and an efficient cathartic given if needed . Within a comparatively short time the dog begins to show the characteristic action of the drug . In one to two hours the dog loses control of its legs and of the muscles supporting its head so that when nothing occurs to attract its attention its head will droop its body sway . When severely affected the animal will stagger and fall the intoxication being peculiarly suggestive and striking 8220 . A dog weighing 25 pounds received an injection of two ounces of an active USP fluid extract in the jugular vein with the expectation it would certainly be sufficient to produce death . At the beginning of our observations about the animal being unconscious for our surprise for being unconscious after our surprise about being unconscious about being about about the surprise for the day after being unconscious . To find our surprise after our expectation that it would definitely be enough to produce a surprise for our expectation to produce the unexpected surprise about the unexpected death after the unexpected outcome of the unexpected effects of our unexpected . Not a single case of fatal poisoning have we have been able to find the unexpected symptoms . Not one case of . the unexpected toxicity have we often often often found to find ourselves often

I was headed for Chicago for a Green Party USA National Coordinating Committee meeting where I was to speak the next night on biochemical warfare and pesticides as weapons of war . This was the third time this year I had traveled out of or attempted to in this case Bangor Airport on American Airlines using an eticket purchased from Pricelinecom bought weeks before with my own credit card . They had no reason for profiling and singling me out It had to have been because of my political views which of course is not a good reason see US Constitution8217s first Ten Amendments otherwise known as the Bill of Rights . The ticket agent spent an inordinate amount of time on his computer then finally produced a boarding pass with a large 8220S8221 written on it I asked him what that meant and he said I had been picked to have my bags searched . Then to the xray for my bags and me I said to the two women sitting by the machine that scans the bags sort of apologetically 8220I8217d like it if whoever searches through my clothes and things  The American Airlines agent said 8220You can8217t get on the plane and stated what I had to do there . The Guardsman overheard and he wasn't done with me Clearly this nonsubservient female had to be punished for not being sufficiently obsequious . He took me to the entrance area apart apart from anyone else and ordered the policeman to stay with me . The policeman wasn't free to leave but I thought there was a pleasant local man and we talked about what we had just happened as well as people knew etc .

We used to hear about this only in places usually in military regimes usually in other places usually usually military regimes . The situation looked like a sort of like a situation like a military regime in other countries usually in places like Iran and other places where people usually have access to the military. The situation is like a movie like a bad movie. Within Within Within America, Within America has happened to me that has happened over 1200 people have been affected by this type of repression. It is how people get 8220disappeared which has happened. Within America’s own military regimes. It has happened
---  H L Mencken 188082111956 is often smilingly referred to as the Sage of Baltimore . During the first third of the twentieth century he was the most outspoken irrepressibly contrarian literary and political journalist in the U.S. He produced exuberant gorgeous prose of such gusto that carnival barkers and fundamentalist preachers might have learnt from him He could be loud and snide or silkily ironic 8211 but never dull When Menckan attacked he left no survivors when he praised it felt like Christmas morning . The six volumes of his collected Prejudices 8211 essentially his best essays about American literature culture and politics are cocksure about everything but whether they are right or boneheaded one hardly cares . The book is a botch from end to end and in that botch there is not even the palliation of an arduous enterprise is visible No inherent difficulty is visible The story is anything but complex and subtle and anything but subtle lies wholly in the fact that the author made a mess of the writing . The review originally appeared in The TLS whose website is www.thetlscouk and is reposted with permission to use this review by The Daily Discussion. This review was originally published by The TLS  Modernism was a closed book to Mencken for Modernism . He disliked Modernism but preferred those poets who were down to earth a bit folksy Edgar Lee Masters Carl Sandburg Edwin Arlington Robinson Robert Frost . He was drawn to Edna St Vincent Millay for her 8220voluptuousness8221 and late in life visited Ezra Pound when the poet was incarcerated at St Elizabeths Hospital for the insane . In the Heart of a Fool will probably affect you in the incomparable phrase of Clayton Hamilton like 8220the music of a million Easterlilies leaping from the grave and laughing with a silver singing8221 But if you are a carnal fellow as I am with a stomach ruined by alcohol it will gag you8221 He loathes the American tendency to 8220a highly selfconscious and insipid correctness a bloodless respectability a submergence of matter in manner8221 For so long as White holds a pen these ancient sweets will be on sale at the departmentstore bookcounters and they will grow sweeter and sweeter . He also detested jazz couldn8217t perceive any artistic merit in film 8211 though he did once interview a wearyhearted Rudolph Valentino 8211 and disliked seeing couples wriggling .
---  Dostoevsky was unusually gifted at plumbing the human heart in Brothers Karamazov . His portrayal of Inquisition reality brings us to the brink of the moral precipice on which our country teeters today . The Spanish called this procedure quite plainly 8220tortura del agua . They inserted a cloth into the victim's mouth forcing the victim to ingest water spilled from a jar starting the drowning process . The 15 ampamp 16 Century Spanish inquisitors were not squeamish and had little need for circumlocutions or euphemisms like 8220alternative set of procedures8221 that are part of President George W Bush8217s lexicon . The information from John Kiriakou confirms what has long been a nobrainer but not definitively established before namely that President Bush bragged about the effectiveness of waterboarding Zubayda was given pride of place in Bush's remarkable speech of Sept 6 2006 in which he bragged of such procedures and appealed successfully for passage of the Military Commissions Act that allows a president to define what set of interrogation procedures can be used by the CIA . New Attorney General Michael Mukasey said he still cannot decide whether waterboarding is torture or torture is torture . He said he cannot know if waterboarding was torture .  The past few weeks have witnessed an unseemly square dance in Congress highlighting conflicting claims about what those who are supposed to be overseeing the intelligence community knew and when they knew it . Lawmakers have been so thoroughly intimidated by the White House that I get physically ill watching the likes of Nancy Pelosi and Jane Harman moan about how secretive and nasty the Bush administration has been . Jay Rockefeller chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee is so afraid of his own shadow that he only ventures outdoors at night or in bad weather . House Intelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes has been fawning all over Jos233 Rodriguez the former CIA Deputy Director of Operations who ordered the tapes destroyed . Reyes is a big fan of Jack Bauer and not clear he made clear he is a fan of destroying the tapes after Rodriguez destroyed the tapes became public after they became public . Reyes cautioned against allowing investigations against allowing . He was referring to whom he was referring. to himself as well as allowing the CIA to continue using them and appealed for a different set of procedures for interrogation . On Sept 6 2006, Bush bragged about his 8220 alternative set of interrogation procedures for John Kimmons, Lt. Lt. Kimmons took a very different approach to using the CIA . Kimmons. to use them
---  The recent electoral victory of Barack Obama and the Democratic party presents a unique opportunity to overturn the most perverse policy of the Bush administration and the religious right the conservative repressive sexual agenda . The following nine proposals can help frame a new sexual agenda to be introduced in the first 100 days . For the last three decades Christian conservatives fought a takenoprisoners war over popular morality taking power with Bush8217s victory in 2000 Christian conservatives were finally in the position to impose their beliefs as public policy And they did so with a vengeance .

---  Rep Dennis Kucinich tells us why he isn8217t buckling under pressure to vote for the president8217s health care reform bill . He also tells us about his own bill calling for a full withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan . This interview was recorded Tuesday March 9 g_ Podcast: Truthdig podcast I8217m Peter Scheer and Josh Scheer . Truthdig interview: Dennis, Josh, Josh Scheers, Dennis, Dennis and Josh . Dennis Kukinich: I have had several meetings with the president on this bill And I have indicated my concerns No effort was made to address the concerns that I raised I offered to come to the health care summit The White House wasn't interested Even at this late date I have suggested that they resurrect a robust public option and protect the legal right of states to set up their own singlepayer system They8217re not interested. I haven't seen the fight I haven’t seen any example where they tried to . I haven8217I haven”t seen the . fight I’m still open to the White House’s efforts to continue to . continue to make the bill one that can be supported But I just don’8217’  The bill would waive the 8220risk of preemption8221 which is being used by insurance companies to attack the rights of states to set up singlepayer plans . A bill calling for a return of all troops from Afghanistan within 30 days or a year as it is coming up within a year . The insurance companies have enormous influence every time we have seen whenever the House proposal came through when the Senate and White House proposals came through . There8217s no hope of being able to control insurance companies premiums with the government having to subsidize the rates I'm just saying we need health care not insurance care And if the national government can't step up then it's going to move forward then it will step up to the challenge of the challenge I'm going to challenge the challenge, says Senator Ed McCain . The bill is very very very up and down, he says. We need to go forward, he said. We have a very very good time to get back into the fight in Afghanistan, he added. It's a very bad time to go back into Afghanistan, I'm not going to back in the U.S. I'm still listening carefully to what's being said but unless there is a dramatic change in the change, it's coming up .
---  During the recent visit of Chinese President Hu Jintao to Washington the White House seemed bent on trying in every way possible to extend him a cool reception . The Chinese expected a state dinner normally accorded to a head of state on the first official visit to the United States . But Bill Gates regaled the Chinese president with a formal banquet at his 100 million lakeside mansion . While Hu received a frosty reception in Washington DC he was treated as a superstar in the state of Washington by the kings of the computer industry Microsoft the world's largest coffee shop chain Starbucks and America8217s preeminent aircraft maker Boeing . Both Ronald Reagan and Deng Xiaoping were great fans of the neoliberal guru Milton Friedman . To me Milton Friedman was a farright neoliberal economist who favored the opening of markets in developing countries by political means or military intervention if necessary It was his students from Chicago University that General Pinochet had invited to transform Chile 8217s economy after he overthrew the economy after overthrowing the legally elected president Allende with CIA help in 1973 The 8220Chicago Boys8221 ordered a 8220shock treatment8221 which called for drastic reduction in the money supply and government spending and reduced labor costs . To turn their economies around countries had to cut taxes  China8217s neoliberal communist bureaucrats have been more interested in protecting employers than in enforcing labor laws . The secret of China's economic miracle is its browbeaten working class . The average yearly income of a Chinese peasant in 2003 was 317 . On the other side of the social spectrum is the increasingly wealthy urban middle class emerging on the coattails of the coterie of the superrich . As the number of protests increases so does the intensity of violence used to suppress them . The worst occurred last December when a special paramilitary unit of the national police force shot and killed as many as 20 protesters in the Guangdong village of Dongzhou . This is the largest known killing of unarmed civilians in China since 1989 and has been dubbed as the 82anmen Massacre since 1989 . The protest began over the forced eviction of the official eviction of villagers from their land to make room for the official construction of a foreignfinanced wind power plant . The official government failed to offer 3 per cent compensation in which one resident described as “not enough to wipe one out of one8217’s assressions” – not really wiping one out to wipe out one of the people’ – but they were brought into the toilet toilet .

---  Despite the global hype associated with reversing aid debt and trade injustices during the past few days it hasn8217t been an easy time for the huge NonGovernmental Organizations at the centre of the action . Oxfam8217s revolvingdoor relationship with chancellor Gordon Brown has neutered the demands strategies and tactics of the 450member NGO campaign 8216Make Poverty History8217 The British magazine Red Pepper followed up with a devastating political critique of the campaign including a refusal to countenance any antiwar message that will embarrass Brown and Tony Blair . The heart of the problem is that the large mainstream NGOs 173 and here we do not mean War on Want the World Development Movement and Christian Aid 8211 are not putting serious pressure on the G8 . GCAP 8216A single global title for the mobilization is needed to provide focus cohesion and to maximise impact of activity for the mobilizements of the mobilization . The aim of 8220White Band Day8221 will be to get everyone around the world that wants to end poverty to wear a white band on those days8217 is to be to be encouraged by the Global Call to Action Against Poverty . The GCAP has superb member organizations across the Third World . There is a need for focus and cohesion but a  Oxfam International issued a report yesterday that praised international trade as a potentially enormous boon to the world . The extreme element of the antiglobalization movement is wrong8221 said Kevin Watkins a senior policy adviser for Oxfam who wrote most of the report . Oxfam undermines the demands of social movements and think tanks in the South such as Via Campesina Movement of Landless Workers . Proximity to Downing Street and Pennsylvania Avenue has unfortunately become a malign substitute for political common sense . The World Bank is in good hands, says Interaction chief executive officer of Interaction the 160member NGO coalition many of whose members are considered de facto subsidiaries of US AID . Even Johannesburgbased Civicus International staff have informally relabeled their objective the 8216Minimalist Development Goals 8220Trade can deliver much more for poor countries than aid or debt relief . The white bands grace some African NGO wrists and heads from Civicus . The headbands are so distasteful for the South African left African NGOs to adopt as a high priority topdown Make Poverty History and even GCAP campaigns which endorse MDG endgoals dreamt up in the backrooms of the UN where Bush administration ideologues breathe down bureaucrats impose patriarchal and Christianfundamentalist values
---  Urban planners in many cities around the world are imposing regulations that discourage the creation of affordable housing while slums expand experts say . Nearly 55 percent of the world8217s population lives in urban areas a proportion that is expected to increase to twothirds by 2050 according to data from the United Nations . The number of people living in slums and informal settlements in cities is also rising UN data showed much of their need for affordable housing could be met if city planners eased regulations that govern the use of land . The market will happily serve the poor if regulators allow it with basic health and safety guidelines and fewer limits8221 said Bimal Patel president of CEPT University in Ahmedabad . With urban populations rising rapidly in India planners urgently need to change their approaches and use land more efficiently said Patel and Bertaud said that planners need to . Investing in public transport infrastructure is also important as it would provide people with quicker access to suburban areas where they could afford housing said Bertaud . The theme of the Summit of the Americas is the fight against corruption and the right policy cities can grow rapidly while improving their infrastructure and their environment8221 he said . Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau backed air strikes by the United States and its allies on Syria on Saturday .  Russian bid for the United Nations Security Council to condemn US British and French air strikes on Syria failed on Saturday after only China and Bolivia joined Russia to vote in favor of a draft resolution . The 15member council met on Saturday at Russia8217s request the fifth time it has met on Syria since a suspected deadly toxic gas attack in the Syrian town of Douma a week ago . Russia and Syria have said there was no evidence of a chemical weapons attack . The United States France and Britain fired 105 missiles overnight in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack . Western powers said on Saturday their missile attacks struck at the heart of Syria's chemical weapons program but the restrained assault appeared unlikely to shift the course of the 7yearold civil war . The bombing was the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syrian President Bashar alAssad and his superpower ally Russia but the three countries said the strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical capabilities and not intervening in the civil war The air attack was unlikely to alter an illegal act of aggression aimed at Damascus or alter its mult mult multmultimotion . The US President Donald Trump called the operation a success on Twitter and proclaimed the mission a success . during the public part of a meeting held minutes earlier Trudeau said there is 8220positive momentum8221
---  On 1st November 1911 Lieutenant Giulio Gavotti dropped the first bomb from an aeroplane in the Libyan desert . The Italians decided that they had to increase the terrorising effect of their bombing and strafing to keep the enemy on the run . The newlyinvented airplane offered a way of displaying Italian power across vast swathes of land which were in effect controlled by local Arabs who preferred the Muslim Turks to the Christian Italians . But the Libyans proved harder to terrify into submission than Rome anticipated . 8000 Italians were killed or wounded or wounded in the war which was vastly more costly than Italians had expected . Oil was not the Italian motive in occupying Libya wrapped up in nationalist rhetoric and civilizational . Libya was not oil at the end of the nationalist period which indicated that oil was any serious exploration lay beneath the desert lay beneath . Fascist period indicated that Libya was any major exploration undertaken . At end of Libyan rule of thirty years of Italian rule was end of thirty-year-old rule of 30 years of rule . Libya would return to being the bread basket of the Mediterranean as it had been under the Roman Empire under Roman Empire . The first major oil exploration undertaken at end of Fascist rule of forty years of occupation . T  The 1907 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate ET Moneta became the first 8211 though by no means the last recipient of the dynamite fortune 8217s . The Catholic hierarchy had been hostile to the secular not to say Masonic Italian political elite but it endorsed Giolitti8217s crusade in Libya with as much enthusiasm as its predecessors had backed the original version over eight hundred years earlier . Bertrand Russell saw Bruno Mussolini's evocation of air power as embodying the reality of the modern totalitarian regimes but worse still worse still of a future world controlled from the air . The airplane and the destructive power it could project enthralled Mussolini as it had repelled Mussolini the Marxist . He declared that the airplane was 8220the first Fascist8221 He became a bornagain bomber Mussolini . In Ethiopia he took his war for civilization to new depths Fascist Italy announced it would abolish slavery there but first it had to conquer the natives . The exiled Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie described to the League of Nations how the Italians used cropspraying techniques designed to kill insects to poison the natives to poison his people . The plane was also used to suppress his opponents and did not hide behind cant about having 8220no reports of civilian casualties
---  53 percent of French citizens identify as Catholic but only 5 percent regularly attend Mass according to a recent poll conducted by Ipsos and reported by the Catholic newspaper La Croix . Recent poll also suggested that Mass attendance may not be the only measure of the strength of Catholicism . The resurgent Catholic bloc was foreshadowed by the backlash in the 1980s to the Socialist government to merge public schools and by the opposition to sames marriage in 2013 . The number of priests in the Archdiocese of Paris has already showed an uptick something than can only help attract people to the pews . There are also more activities outside of weekly Mass than I remember the parish is now caring for a family of Iraqi Christians and local teenagers have started a project with a local crafts school to beautify the church . The revival of Catholicism in France was something you could fleetingly smell in the air. At first the revival of Catholics is not palpably growing but it is significant that they have finally plateaued after a multidecade decline after a multi-decade decline of priests has already shown an uptick in the number of Catholic priests in Paris has also showed an increase in weekly Mass . It is estimated that 23 percent of the French population are 8220involved Catholics . The  France is known as one of the most fiercely secular countries on earth . Only 10 percent of French citizens considered 8220being a Christian8221 a 8220very important8221 part of French identity . The resurgence of Catholicism as a political force in France began in 2013 with the startling intensity of La Manif Pour Tous8220Protest for All . The movement formed to oppose France8217s samesex marriage bill formed in 2013 . Many French people jaded about politics about politics and enthusiastic about John Paul IIs theology . These are not conservatives in either the U.S. or traditional French soilandtradition . They are just likely to bang on Pope Francis about about the Pope's environmental encyclcyclcyclist body or to wax about the body of John Paul Si178 or wax about his body to wax on the Pope IIs . Fillon is not likely to bend the mold on Pope John Paul Is. He is not just as likely to bow down to the moldy Catholic theology. He's not just about Pope Francis. He says he's just about about Pope Paul II. He’s moldy . He says that he’ll be just about the molding of the mold. I’m
---  Frantz Fanon's words bear heeding if we are to avoid succumbing to the divideandconquer strategies of the oppressors . The rebellion which shook the streets of Oakland a week ago has irreversibly changed the political equation surrounding the murder of Oscar Grant III by transit police officer Johannes Mehserle . Protest organizers insist on avoiding this thorny question for fear that they may be painted with the brush of violence but only those in bad faith could realistically deny that it was the streetlevel resistance of the state that led the state to act . The protest organizers from the newlyformed Coalition Against Police Executions CAPE have insistently ignored this most basic of truths that protest organizers insistently ignore . At a meeting CAPE organizers were criticized for using the criticism of the movement to use the divide and divide to divide the movement as a dividing line to divide and conquer the movement . At the Fruitvale BART protest was much like a largely middle-class segment of the Oakland community at the most militant voices like Reverend Rev. Kane Kane thunderously thunderously insisted that we shouldn’t blame the youth in the streets for the murder . The Reverend of the Nation of Islam pointedly emphasized that anger at Grant8217s murder was justified with the anger  The official march gathered outside City Hall in Frank Ogawa Plaza with speakers including Mayor Ron Dellums rapper Too hort and CAPE leadership . A solitary protest insisting that we not create police structures was ruled outoforder on procedural grounds and met with a deafening consensus of silence . But one error stood out above all others the organizers8217 open neglect for the obvious fact that the attention paid by Mayor Dellums and DA Orloff to the case the case garnered and the subsequent arrest of Mehserle were only the result of last week8217s rebellion . The same chants heard a week prior made an encore appearance specifically 8220No Justice No Peace No Peace Fucking the Police8221 In an ingenious display of pageantry the security force channeled this unrest into a gesture of victory convincing the police to stand down momentarily but this symbolic victory was to be shortlived . The street remained crowded with even more protestors than a week before and those gathered had clearly not been pacified by Mehserlle . Some had even broken from the 8220official8221 security orientation in disagreement with some of the security team in disagreement and refused to participate in this policing of the streets . The security force took it upon themselves to move the crowd forming
---  Eurozone in fact seems to be a self-contained and mercantant economy which displays less proclivity to import economy when the economy slides so even though imports slides down . Eurozone is a pretty selfilant and somewhat mercantile mercantilist economy . The most recent data from the COMEX suggests that speculators are heavily short on the euro and yet the currency has fallen less than 10 per cent from its recent highs . We also know from an authority no less than the Bank of International Settlements the same initials in the banking system as the hyperinimar hyperinflation channel despite today's rapidly weakening economy Europe is almost recession today . Now consider us consider the weakening of the economy despite today’s rapidly weakening trade channel and consider us certainly in Europe’S rapidly weakening today” – We are not seeing much of the current deterioration in the euro zone today . The most important thing to consider is that we are seeing much deterioration in this kind of environment that that kind of ‘eurozone  – we are not experiencing any kind of deterioration in our current economic deterioration  . So far as what happens if the ECB were significantly expand its bond buying program that were significantly its bond purchasing program  The bonds would not be trading at these distressed levels if not for the solvency issue which the ECB can easily address if it chooses to do so . But this is a question of political will not operational 8220sustainability not operational . The notion of an ECB being capital constrained is insane by contrast the status quo is a loser for everybody including Germany . There are other issues which are making Germany8217s position increasingly untenable notably on the political front in particular the mounting strains between France and Germany . But that is a separate issue from the question of whether the bond buying program per se will pose a threat to the ECB's balance sheet . It will not pose a big income transfer from the private bond holders who sell to ECB which can build up its capital base via the profits it makes on purchasing these distressed bonds . The good news is that there finally appears to be some recognition of the dangers of this approach to this approach . Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter speaking at a conference in Hamburg on Friday was more direct 8216Trust in government treasuries was so thoroughly destroyed by involving private sector investors in the debt relief that you have to wonder why anyone still buys government bonds at all in the bond . The ECB is not a threat
---  President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to be interviewed under oath by Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US election . The White House and allies in Congress have stepped up attacks on the investigation's credibility and Trump himself has hedged on whether he would answer questions . Senior US intelligence officers including CIA Director Mike Pompeo had been questioned by the special counsel8217s team about whether Trump tried to obstruct justice in the Russia probe . The Kremlin has denied conclusions by US intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election campaign using hacking and propaganda to try to tilt the race in Trump's favor . Trump on Wednesday denied a Washington Post report that last year he had asked thenacting FBI Director Andrew McCabe whom he had voted for in 2016 which according to reports left McCabe concerned about civil servants being interrogated about their political leanings . The Washington Post said McCabe was concerned about being interrogated by their political leaningings . Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe planned to retire on Sunday with full or full benefits of his pension but all of his full benefits could be at risk but some could be preserved with full benefits but some may be in danger of his retirement from his full pension but some benefits may be preserved at the end of the matter .  The recommendation to fire McCabe was based on a report by the inspector general which according to a source says McCabe misled investigators about his communications with a former Wall Street Journal reporter . McCabe's wife a Democrat got donations for her Virginia state Senate campaign from Virginia8217s then governor Terry McAuliffe a close ally of the Clintons . McCabe denies misleading investigators in any way . If Sessions allows McCabe to stay until his retirement he could face a backlash from conservatives who have attacked the FBI . The White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the decision is up to Sessions but also called McCabe a 8220bad actor8221 and said it is 8220well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior8221 It is unclear what will determine if McCabe can retain all or part of his pension if he is fired the source said in general the impact of a person8217S termination depends on facts and circumstances according to the Justice Department spokeswoman . The FBI has said that at the time McCabe got involved in one of the probes into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server his wife was over his election campaign was over . McCabe said he was not trying to quash the probe which McCabe said was not a quashing the investigation into the Clintons8217 charitable foundation . The U.S.
---  Hundreds of thousands of Americans galvanized by last month8217s Florida school massacre rallied on Saturday at nationwide March For Our Lives protests led by students demanding tighter gun laws . The massive rallies aim to break a legislative gridlock that has long stymied efforts to increase restrictions on firearms sales in a nation where mass shootings like the one on Feb 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have become frighteningly common . Organizers want the US Congress many of whose members are up for reelection in November to ban the sale of assault weapons and tighten background checks for gun buyers . The youthful US organizers have wonudos and cash from dozens of celebrities with singer Demi Lovato and Hamilton creator Miranda Miranda among those among those who have donated . On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a 13 trillion spending bill bill including modest improvements to background checks and grants to help prevent gun violence to help schools and grant gun violence . On the other side of the debate gun rights advocates cite constitutional guarantees of the right to bear arms for gun sales for gun purchasers . The White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said the administration has generally favor stricter gun controls that are generally a boost for stricter gun control measures that generally favor Democrats who generally favor tighter gun controls . The rally  President Emmanuel Macron said Beltrame fell as a hero giving up his life to halt the murderous outfit of a jihadist terrorist . Beltrame was part of a team of gendarmes who were among the first to arrive at the supermarket scene . He offered to trade places with a hostage the attacker was still holding whereafter he took her place and left his mobile phone on a table line open . The attacker was identified by authorities as Redouane Lakdim a 25-year-old Moroccanborn French national from the city of Carcassonne not far from Trebes . Lakdim was known to authorities for drugdealing and other petty crimes but had also been under surveillance by security services in 20162017 for links to the radical Salafist movement Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said on Friday . He killed three people and injured 16 others on Friday according to a government readout Beltrame8217s death took the number killed to four . The Islamic State IS militant group claimed responsibility for the attack . Police arrested two people as part of the investigation into the attack one of them a woman connected to Lakdim on Friday and a 17-yearold man said to be one of his friends overnight . The Grand Mosque of Paris the largest in the country said the Muslim community joined
---  Senior officials from the three nations will meet in Montreal for a week starting on Tuesday in the sixth and penultimate round of talks to modernize the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement . Talks are supposed to wrap up by the end of March to avoid clashing with Mexico's general elections in July . Negotiators from the United States Canada and Mexico will try to settle major differences over revamping a pact that President Donald Trump has threatened to abandon . The Republican president has generated confusion by indicating that he might extend the deadline for talks while saying that walking away from the table would be the best idea . A council advising Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on NAFTA has concluded that Washington is most likely to announce that it wants out of the pact It met with Freeland who says a positive result is still quite possible last week . A large majority of economists polled by Reuters are betting the treaty will be renegotiated successfully with only marginal changes . A number of UK-based finance firms employing the bulk of 119-based international workers in international finance firms has dropped by half compared to 5000 jobs in six months ago . A survey of 119 finance firms in Paris published published in September found that the number of jobs to be created in the UK has dropped to 5000  The September survey which found that they planned to move or create 10000 jobs on the continent by Brexit Day on March 29 2019 was also as at the lower end of estimates by industry lobby groups and financial firms . More than half of the companies surveyed told Reuters they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses because of a hard exit from the EU . The survey indicated 4798 banking roles would be affected but some would be new roles in Europe the executives surveyed said . The majority of banks responded that it wouldn't make any difference to their plans because it doesn8217t clarify anything and is still vulnerable to any number of political scenarios including the potential collapse of May8217s government . The future of London as Europe's financial centre is one of the biggest issues in Brexit talks because it is Britain's largest export sector and biggest source of tax . Rival cities within the bloc are battling to draw highlypaid banking jobs and the revenues they bring to draw jobs and draw highly paid banking jobs from London-based banking jobs . The bulk of jobs may be moved to rival centres in continental Europe after the survey found France has emerged as the biggest winner in the fight for London based banking jobs after the EU financial centre after the vote for Paris has emerged .
---  Two recent reports issued by the US Department of State 8220Country Reports on Human Rights Practices8221 and 8220Report on Global AntiSemitism8221 deserve attention in light of the Department8217s professed declaration that 8220a central goal of US foreign policy has been the promotion of respect for human rights . An important issue is the distinction between legitimate criticism of legitimate policies and criticism of the policies of the State of Israel or the demonization of Israel . The report reflects a renewed anger and frustration against the Israeli state beginning in 2000 it does not address what may have caused this rise in what it terms antiSemitism it merely lists the incidents and denies the possibility that people across the globe including member states of the EU which condemns could have as much to express resentment of Israel as they do about the government at the government of George W Bush . In short while the report reflects the report, the report expresses a renewed angry and outrage of Israel of reason and outrage and outrage . The Report reflects a new anger and frustrated against the state of Israel starting in 2000. In short While the report does not discuss what may be caused by the rise in antiSemitism. It denies the fact that people in the EU could haveAs much could have expressed resentment and outrage  The distinction is at root subterfuge it forces legitimate criticism of a state8217s political and human rights actions into a category that stops the criticism in its tracks thus in effect legitimizing the undemocratic illegal and abusive state actions should they exist . Joseph Massad Professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University published an article on this very term in AlAhram Weekly OnLine 2004720op63htm . Massad marks the philological basis of the term the 8220positing of modern European Jews as direct descendants of the ancient Hebrews8221 . The identifying of Jews as Semites because their ancestors spoke Hebrew a Semitic language a mistaken fact since they spoke Aramaic the language of the Talmud . The subsequent transformation of the Jews into a racial category based on this understanding as noted in the State Department 8217s definition and the resulting hatred of European antiSemitism as directed against European Jews As Massad notes . The following: Massad concludes that many that any manifestations of hatred against Jews in any geographic location on Earth and in any historical period is 8216antiSemitism8217 smacks of a gross misunderstanding of the European history of antiSemitism8221 Yet this is precisely what the State Dept. definition does it applies one understanding of
---  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is leading the opinion polls leading the antiestablishment vote . A victory could usher in a more distant and confrontational relationship between the two nations . The three top contenders for the July election have all said Mexico will not pay for the wall the US president wants to build on the US southern border . Trump is causing a lot of anger among Mexicans with a negative attitude towards the United States which is not helpful or healthy or healthy if the country is not a neighboring country . Anti-Trump rhetoric of all presidential candidates against him is unifying the rhetoric of the presidential candidates and strengthening the hand of the frontrunner . The most obvious beneficiary of opposition to Trump at least initially would be Lopez OBRador Buendia said last week . Trump said he said Mexico is pacifististist and that Mexico is only likely to intensify to intensify its anti-Trump sentiment because Mexico is a pacifist and would not end up fighting for war with the U.S. AntiTrump rhetoric would intensify if the neighboring country is only to intensify if it is not helped or not helpful if the nation is likely to end up unifying its relations with the neighboring nation . A study showed that since Trump entered presidential politics the image of the US has deteriorated sharply  Nasdaq Composite index was sharply lower on Wednesday dragged down by losses in Amazon and tech heavyweights such as Apple and Intel . Amazon fell more than 5 percent after reports that President Donald Trump was looking to target the company by changing its tax treatment . Apple dropped about 1 percent after Goldman Sachs analyst cut sales estimate for iPhone for March and June quarters citing weak demand . Intel was down 37 percent and weighed the most on the SampampP tech index 8220Tech and discretionary stocks have been strong Those are two sectors that are up yeartodate and what we8217re seeing is profittaking in the quarterend8221 said Michael O8217Rourke Chief Market Strategist Jonestrading Greenwich Connecticut Facebook8217s shares rose marginally after days of losses that wiped out more than 100 billion in market value . The main indexes were on track to record their worst month since January 2016 hurt by fears of a trade war between the United States and China as well as rising US interest rates and fears of rising trade tensions . Wall Street money managers who make bets for a living said they remain confident the market value will rise significantly this year . Investors remain sanguine about their prospects to make money even as they try and dissect Trump's negotiating tactics .

---  A ghost of the past was the real winner of the French presidential election . Emmanuel Macron won only because a majority felt they had to vote against the ghost of 8220fascism8221 allegedly embodied by his opponent Marine Le Pen . The significance of this election is so widely misrepresented that clarification requires a fairly thorough explanation of the Macron project and what the impossible election of Marine LePen would have meant would have been impossible . Despite the multiparty nature of French elections for the past generation France has been essentially ruled by a twoparty system with government power alternating between the Socialist Party roughly the equivalent of the US Democratic Party and a party inherited from the Gaullist tradition . Both have adopted neoliberal economic policies or more precisely they have followed European Union directives requiring member states to adopt neoliberal economic . policies . The most thoughtful reaction has been to start realizing that it is the European Union itself that imposes this unpopular economic conformism . The welloiled Macron machine labeled 8220En Marche8221 has exploited the popular reaction against both parties for continuing to pursue the same unpopular policies . Macron machine has broken and absorbed large parts of both in an obvious move to turn En Marche into a single catchall party loyal to Macron . The destruction of the Socialist .  France will no longer be a sovereign nation but a reliable region in a federalized European Union following a rigorous economic policy made in Germany by bankers and a bellicose foreign policy made by neocons . The Macron program amounts to a profound ideological transformation of the French ideal of equality from a horizontal concept meaning equal benefits for all to the vertical ideal of opportunity8221 . The French have traditionally been logical enough to understand that everyone can8217t rise above the others . For Macron the ruin of French industry and French farming seem to be welcome steps toward an economy of individual initiative symbolized by startups . The opposition to Macron8217s catchall governance party appears weak and fatally divided . In short the genuine opposition must be 8220souverainainiste concerned with preserving French sovereignty . M233lenlenon and Marine Le Pen are drastically divided but they are far behind the Socialist Party far behind JeanLucéérémier M233chon and JeanLuciel M233Lenchon . The Republicans are profoundly destabilized and M233Chon is intelligent enough to have realized that he realized the policies he has realized that the socialists have both advocates that he cannot be achieved unless France recovers its social advocates against the policies of both social advocates .
---  After 911 George W Bush8217s administration wasted no time in announcing that the US was engaged in a war . Obama without fanfare junked Bush's formulation as he did again in a speech at the National Defense University last week . Names bestow meaning in war a name attached to a date can shape our understanding of what the conflict was all about . Europeans once referred to the calamitous events of 19141918 as the Great War . Americans today characterize the horrendous fraternal bloodletting of 18611865 as the Civil War . Yet if the appellation went away the conflict itself shorn of identifying marks continued Does it matter that ours has become and remains a nameless war? The World War II is misleading and not familiar and not particularly useful in fact, says Andrew J Bacevich. The period is not especially useful in the question in question in which the two wars saw at least at least a useful and useful in question at the question of who would dominate East Asia at stake at stake was the Manchuria at stake in question of the question at stake of defeat at the time of 1941 at stake . In fact there was the U.S. at stake the United States against Japan at stake. At stake there was a crushing defeat at stake  It matters what we choose to call the military enterprise we8217ve been waging not only in Iraq and Afghanistan but also in any number of other countries scattered across the Islamic world . Washington seems in no hurry to name its nameless war 8212 and will no doubt settle on something selfserving or anodyne if it ever finally addresses the issue 8212 perhaps we should jumpstart the process . The Long War was coined not long after 911 by senior officers in the Pentagon this formulation never gained traction with either civilian officials or the general public . Yet the Long War deserves consideration even though 8212 or perhaps because 8212 it has lost its luster with the passage of time . It connoted grand ambitions buoyed by extreme confidence in the efficacy of American military might. At the outset it conundered grand ambitions . For Long War combatants the object of the exercise has become to persist for the . Long War is now to persist. The Long . War just might conclude by the end of 2014 if President Obama keeps his pledge to end the US combat role in Afghanistan and if he avoids getting sucked into Syria8217s civil war into Syria . The War Against Al Qaeda has been focused on Afghanistan where US troops have waged the longest war in American
---  Cripdom is the big bogeyman in our society today today . Nondisabled folks are projecting our own fears about disability onto the people who actually have the disabilities . Thompson had chronic pain from back surgery and an artificial hip . Christopher Reeve is tired of being brought up as the sine qua non of cripdom . The Not Dead is at the root of all those 8220brave8221 and 8220courageous8221 monikers that routinely get applied to crips who don8217t kill themselves who just keep plodding on MZ . We must not forget that many people who acquire disabilities like Maggie8217s are simply the same way in the debate as many nondisabled people simply feel simply bodiest as the bodiest bodiest . To diss dissing someone dissing is the ultimate form of dissing and it goes on all the time in regard to disability . To talk about dissing, it goes all over the internet only. Talk about Dissing about someone disss . To think about someone who isn't believed to believe you can’t believe you’re just being brave or courageous and what they say about being a person who isn”t believed .  The disability rights movement has never forgiven Clint Eastwood for his celeb blitz against the ADA in the spring of 2000 . Eastwood had been called in by Rep Mark Foley who was pushing a bill called the ADA Notification Act which would require crips who were suing access violators to give the violator 90 days8217 notice before suing them no matter that the business had had since 1992 to correct the violations . Disability rights movement unilaterally opposed the bill and ultimately succeeded in keeping it from moving out of committee that year but the bill keeps resurfacing in every session of Congress and I8217m sure a version will be reintroduced again soon California has just had a state version introduced . Actively helping someone end their life is illegal in every state but laws permitting a doctor to provide lethal medication are being contemplated in California Vermont Hawaii and Arizona such a law is in force only in Oregon . The real clincher was the testimony of an ADA consultant Fred Shotz Shotz shotz . Mr Eastwood testified at the May 18 hearing of Fred shotz, an ADA expert who said it was a terrible idea at httpwww.www.com The real story never did get out The real Clint Eastwood and the real story began to emerge Ragged Edge
---  South Africa8217s rand drifted lower on Tuesday as investors waited for more clues from the new leader of the ruling African National Congress on how he plans to rejuvenate the economy and when President Jacob Zuma might step down . At 1620 GMT the rand was down 02 percent at 120800 per dollar eating into gains of around one percent a day earlier .

Organizers want the US Congress many of whose members are up for reelection this year to ban the sale of assault weapons like the one used in the Florida school shooting . At a rally in New York a moment of silence was held for the Parkland victims . The Syrian army paused its bombardment of Douma rebels in Douma last week as rebels rebel insurgents said to be in control of the Syrian government .

At least 25,000 first-time frees voted at the biggest event in Washington where organizers said as many as 500,000 people were expected to demonstrate near the Capitol and call on Congress to fight gun violence to ban assault weapons and tighten background checks for gun sales for gun buyers . The White House administration applauded the young Americans who generally favor stricter gun controls on the issue of exercising their free speech rights . On Friday Republican President Donald Trump signed a 13 trillion-dollar spending bill that includes modest improvements to background checks and grants to help schools and schools . On the other side of the debate gun rights advocates cite constitutional guarantees
---  Janine Jackson interviewed Heidi Beirich on white supremacy for the March 4 2016 CounterSpin . The Southern Poverty Law Center monitors the activities of domestic hate groups and other extremists including the Ku Klux Klan the neoNazi movement and others . The number of hate groups in the U.S. today is definitely higher than it was for example in 2000 We have more like almost a thousand groups today back then about 600 So organized white supremacy is growing But then there8217s the activity on the internet of extremists which has become particularly visible in this campaign season where people who are emboldened in particular by the Trump candidacy have started making racist statements and engaging in racist activities in a much more forward way than prior to when this campaign started heating up . The United States has a horrific history of white supremacy white violence predicated on these beliefs I mean people seem to forget that it only in the mid 821760s that black folks in the United States were accorded the same rights as white people in the US were according the same Rights as white folks . It needs to be talked about and talked about often about hate groups, says Beirich . When a radio host named Bob Grant repeatedly referred to AfricanAmericans as ‘subhuman’s “subhumans”  Southern Poverty Law Center's role for all good citizens is to counter hate speech with speech, says John Carlin . Carlin: There is a form of white privilege when it comes to killers like Dylann Roof right the white shooter in Charleston I would say this is definitely the case with the militia folks who occupied the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon . The federal government has gotten better about the distribution of both types of terrorism but it took a time to make them right that it took time to get them right . The media focus much more on Islamist violence than domestic rightwing violence, but it reflects it seems to be very hard for people to accept that both in federal government and in general in coverage sometimes sometimes sometimes in coverage of both in the federal government . It reflects it reflects the reluctance to accept the government and sometimes in federal coverage of such violence, says Carlin. It seems like it reflects that both government and often we didn’t create the federal coverage in the media. The media has a tendency to think oh that person came from a foreign land land and did something here and did not native America we didn8217s not native to America. We didn”t want to create it. The government came from foreign land

---  Winchester, Virginia, is one of those slowly rotting East Coast burgs that makes passersthrough think to themselves 8220What the hell is this Mayberry USA on crack8221 The town does have that special kind of seediness found only in the US South It might even be considered weirdly colorful in an America studies sort of way with its hardfaced characters straight out of Grapes of Wrath and spooky and wellscrubbed Bible thumpers . Every customer at Burt8217s loves George Bush Worships George Bush One reason is because George Bush doesn't give a shit When his detractors point out the complete fraud of WMDs he doesn't . When newspapers worldwide suggest Bush may . be the biggest international threat today Bush does not give a . shit Bush . The world hates us because we are rich The snaileating winebesotted French are a bunch of spiteful pussies ungrateful that we saved their asses in World War II And that is the common wisdom . If it appears too common to be believable then you have never lived in the American South, it's always best to keep horsecrap in one pile, the world outside is altogether nasty terraina news hour nether region from whence child suicide bombers swarm  In an ersatz democracy maintaining the popular national fiction that everyone is equal it is impermissible to say that although we may all have equal constitutional rights we are not equal . It takes at least some effort toward selfimprovement just to get to the starting line of socioeconomic equality plus an ongoing effort at being informed if you want to function in America nowadays . Southern towns like Dickville are perfect for observing it clearly because here it manifests itself in high definition spittle flecked living color This pig wears no lipstick . The lives and intellectual cultures of the hardest working people in these towns are not just stunted by the smallness of the society into which they were born . They are purposefully held in bondage by a local network of moneyed families bankers bankers bankers developers lawyers and business people in whose interests it is to a have cheap unquestioning and compliant labor force . They invest in developing such a force by not investing how8217s that for making money out of thin air in the education and quality of life for anyone but their own These places are as they say 8220investment paradise8221 That means low taxes few or no local regulations no unions and a Chamber of Commerce tricked out like a gaggle of hookers welcoming the new nonunion air poisoning battery
---  U.S. British and French forces struck Syria with more than 100 missiles on Saturday in the first coordinated Western strikes against the Damascus government targetting what they called chemical weapons sites in retaliation for a poison gas attack . Syria released video of the wreckage of a bombedout research lab but also of President Bashar alAssad arriving at work as usual with the caption 8220morning of resilience8221 There were no immediate reports of casualties with Damascus allies saying the buildings hit had been evacuated in advance British Prime Minister Theresa May described the strike as 8220limited and targeted8221 She said she had authorized British action after intelligence indicated Assad8217s government was to blame for gassing the Damascus suburb of Douma a week ago . Russia accused Britain of staging a sovereign state of staging the attack . UN Security Council to discuss what Moscow decried as an unjustified attack on a chemical weapons attack last week last week and decried it as unjustified as a 'unjustified attack' Moscow has denied that Moscow has decried what it took place as an 'unlawful' attack on the state of the Syrian government and denied that that it decried that it took that attack on Douma last week . Syria releases a dossier which it said it had denied that  The combined US British and French assault involved more missiles but appears to have struck more limited targets than a similar strike Trump ordered a year ago in retaliation for an earlier suspected chemical weapons attack . Syria agreed in 2013 to give up its chemical weapons after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Douma . The global chemical weapons watchdog the OPCW has sent a team to assess last week8217s suspected gas attack . A US official familiar with the military planning said there could be more air strikes if intelligence indicates Assad has not stopped making importing or using chemical weapons including chlorine . The official said this could require a more sustained US air and naval presence in Syria under no circumstances . An explosion in southern Gaza killed four Palestinians on the local health ministry said . Four men were killed during clashes with Israeli troops at a protest demanding the right to return to their right to their homeland at the border of Gaza City at the Gaza City City of Gaza . The Israeli military spokesman said it was caused by an Israeli military tank . Israel did not immediately confirm the men were members of the Islamic Jihad militant militant group Islamic Jihad . The strike was not involved in the area but the Israeli army did not directly involve any Israeli military . The strikes took place in the southern Gaza Strip
---  Canada has 200 troops in Ukraine since last summer . Canada's support to 8216regime change8217 in Syria stands . The Liberals stirred controversy during the election when they promised to end Canada8217s participation in the USled military intervention in northern Iraq . But surprise while the Liberals did carry out a promised withdrawal of the six fighter jets that weren8217t doing much anyway in the skies over Syria and Iraq they ended up tripling the presence of Canadian soldiers on the ground in Iraq to approximately 200 . The new government made unpleasant waves when it upheld the export permit approval by the Conservatives for the US arms manufacturer General Dynamics to sell 15 billion worth of the armoured personnel transport vehicles it manufactures in London Ontario to the dictatorship in Saudi Arabia . Sabre rattling by the newsameold government in Ottawa has been expressed most fully during and after the NATO summit meeting held in Warsaw Poland on July 8 and 9 Canada is also reequipping its entire army including its soontobe Latvia force on the Russian border with antitank missiles . Canada has also sent hundreds of additional soldiers to eastern Europe to join the latest NATO provocation it will lead one of the four new protocombat brigades being established by NATO in countries bordering Russia Canada will land some 450 troops in Latvia  Canada signed a 8220free trade8221 agreement with Ukraine on the same day Trudeau voiced the usual NATO stories about Russia8217s actions in the region since the Maidan coup . The criticism of Russia by Canada by Canada is carefully orchestrated to shield the true state of affairs . Canada the US and the rest of NATO have nothing to say about Ukraine's dereliction of duty with the ceasefire . NATO powers are not used to defiance They don't like to defiance and are trying to drive by NATO to weaken and dismantle the Soviet Union and now the Russia Federation . Events in Ukraine and Crimea have given the US allies and pliant media new propaganda ammunition to bamboozozozle world opinion not-socanymore war and renew the postWW2old war . The mainstream media rely on a mainstream media to dissuade questioning by ordinary citizens in Europe in Europe and join the pro-Western opposition in Canada in the mainstream . The US and Western European opposition in Europe to join pro-Russia and the prowar chorus of pro-war propaganda in Europe .

---  Laura Ling and Euna Lee were first convicted earlier this year and given 12year prison terms in one of North Korea8217samp160 labor camps . The two were working for a tv channel owned by former vice president Al Gore . They crossed North Korea's border with China intent on investigating the alleged trafficking of North Korean women as sex slaves . The harsh sentences faced by Ms Ling and Ms Lee were tied up in the evolution of relations between North Korea and the new Obama government . This judgement has been vindicated by the speed with which they were sprung once Bill Clinton paid a visit . The Cuban Five were sent to a prison the Center of Federal Detention in Miami and put in 8220the hole8221 SL For how long GH 17 months SL Describe the prison as ‘They told it was to protect us from the general population’ The Five was sent to different penitentiaries in 2003 and sent to Lompoc Lompo Lomp in 2003 . The Five were put in solitary for a few months in a box on the box on 8220 the box in the prisons on the prison the center of federal detention in Miami . The 5 were put into a box in a penitentiary for a little piece of the sky .  On May 25 North Korea conducted its secondamp160underground nuclear test two and a halfamp160 years after its first . Obama promptly denounced it as 8220a grave threat to the peace and stability of the world8221 In retrospect we can see what a lucky fellow Barack Obama was to have had during his run for the presidency last year a radical black pastor the Rev Jeremiah Wright as his opponent in an argument about race and racism in America . Obama scored big with whites for his measured putdown of Wright as the embittered voice from an angry past now being thankfully overtaken by a mellower and more sensible age of racial reason . CounterPunchers should prepare appropriately sarcastic statement to be read out by North Korea8217s president or his latest designated successor perhaps beginning with the statement by one British navy man thatamp160 8220it was a millionstoone unlucky chance . The lesson for Iran in this story is that the world could end not with a bang but a million stoone unfortunate chance. It pays to have a nuke You get some respect even a visit from Bill Clinton . The irony stems from the fact that Gates' own own home stems from fact that the front door of Gates’ own home is the missing front door
---  A massive campin led by the Standing Rock nation aimed at blocking the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . The DAPL in question would carry oil from the Bakken shale in North Dakota across several states and under the Missouri River . The Obama administration and a federal court stepped in to temporarily halt construction near the campsite . Still the people of Standing Rock and their thousands of supporters aren't declaring victory and folding their tents just yet . The camp began with a small beachhead last April on the banks of the Cannonball River on land belonging to LaDonna Brave Bull Allard has expanded to multiple camps that have housed as many as 7000 people from all over the world . As the legal struggles for a permanent shutdown of the pipeline construction continue the camps were preparing for another challenge a North Dakota winter . The people of the Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Stone camps were already winterizing in all aspects of the camp and preparing for the cold months ahead . The flags that represent something more than 100 years of Native people in many said to be more than a powerful statement of solidarity a statement of common interest than a fight for clean water for the common interest . They are a powerful symbol of solidarity and hope that the action is built around their belief in nonviolence  Faith Spotted Eagle was there on what she remembered as a wintry blowing day in April when the Sacred Stone camp first opened in April . She had also been part of the successful fight against the Keystone XL Pipeline and pointed out that the networks activated by that fight were coming together again in North Dakota . The camp swelled to 200 then 700 then 700 It spilled over the river into what was at first simply called the overflow camp but as that camp grew the campers began to feel it deserved its own name Oceti Sakowin is the name for the political structure of what is known as the Great Sioux Nation . In 2013 she said a dream of her grandmother sent her to look at the 1863 treaty between her people and the Pawnee on the 150th anniversary of that treaty Jan 25 2013 those nations along with the Oglala and Ponca signed the International Treaty to Protect the Sacred from Tar Sands Projects . The treaty was renewed with prayers and a donation to the Sacred stone camp . She said she hopes the outside world will help8221 with donations and donations But she added that outside support should respect the leadership of the Native people from individuals and environmental groups . The message does not count the number of people who have passed through briefly
---  Fed chairman Bernanke has been on a spree lately delivering three speeches in the last two weeks . Bernanke is merely being polite in not rubbing the faces of European and Asian governments in the fact that unless they are willing to make a structural break and change the world monetary system radically they will remain powerless to avoid giving the United States a free ride . The financial sector has been living in the short run for quite a while now and I suspect that a lot of money managers are planning to get out or be fired now that the game is over and it is over . The most likely result will be for the Fed simply to roll over its loans 8211 as if the problem can be cured by yet more time But when a bubble bursts time makes things worse . Mortgage defaults and foreclosures are rising and it can't work and much can't do much work . The attempt to reflate the real estate market has not worked and it has become unsaleable . The banks collectively are painting themselves into a deeper corner . Donald Trump would tell the Fed and Treasury and FDIC to keep bailing them out of bailing FDIC out or failing them out or fail them or failing . The Fed is painting itself into a deep corner. The banks are collectively painting themselves  A combination of deregulation and moral hazard8221 bailouts 8211 for the top of the economic pyramid not the bottom 8211 will polarize the economy all the more Cities and states will preserve their credit ratings by annulling their pension obligations to publicsector workers and raising excise taxes 8211 but not property taxes . The practice of offbalancesheet accounting already has become quickly obsolete this year The United States is going to adopt Europe8217s normal 8220covered bond8221 practice of bank headoffice liability for mortgages and other loans . The idea that we8217re even in a business 8220cycle8221 is whistling in the dark, Mike Whtney says . The Fed can monetize whatever it wants and as you just pointed out in the preceding question it has been buying junk securities in order to leave sound Treasury securities on the banking system 8217s balance sheets Michael Hudson says. of 90 per cent8221 figures from Market Ticker .

---  Karl Rove and Libby each told reporters about Valerie Plame8217s status as a CIA agent before she was outed albeit Libby did it first on June 23 2003 when he told Judy Miller from the New York Times . Rove and Rove violated the 8220Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement that they signed as a condition of employment which prohibits even confirming or repeating classified information already leaked . Rove's lawyer and Time magazine journalist Viveca Novak led Rove to change his testimony last year to change the grand jury in the CIA leak case . Rove received another getoutofjailfree get card in this instance . How many more getout ofjail free cards does Karl Rove get Eat your heart out Martha Stewart You should have tried playing Monopoly with the GMen on Karl Rove . The FBI is said to have been briefed on at least one of Rove's interviews with the FBI that led to the first getoutOfjail Free card for Rove in the leak case8221 which means Rove changed his testimony . The investigation began after close to a 3-year tax dollar funded investigation by the Grand Jury in the leaked CIA Leak Case . Rove is accused of lying through his teeth to avoid a grand jury . He refused to admit that he  Viveca claims that she did not find out until the fall of 2005 that her remark to Attorney Luskin had led to a search for evidence that Rove and Cooper had spoken to reporters . Rove realized the importance of covering his tracks while he was leaking to reporters in the summer of 2003 . The fact that Rove was not charged on the spot for this slick got another get-free card because he had been ordered to turn over all emails to the special prosecutor just like everyone else in the White House .

---  Darrell Cannon is a senior figure in El Rukn one of Chicago8217s most notorious gangs . The 48-year-old has been housed in Unit Nine since mid1998 when he was moved up from a state prison to attend court hearings on a motion to suppress the 1983 confession that landed him a life sentence for murder . Cannon has never denied that he was driving the car in which a young man was shot and killed but has long argued that he neither knew in advance about the murder nor participated in it . Cannon is getting another day in court more than a decade and a half after the crime with the help of attorneys Flint Taylor and Tim Lohraff . Dozens of other prisoners have come forward saying they were tortured into confessing by police officers from Chicago Area Two who were at the time under the leadership of Commander Jon Burge . The validity of the confessions of dozens of other current and former prisoners are now in doubt . This could turn into one of the great scandals in modern American judicial history exposing a pattern of police violence as horrific as many of the crimes against which they were supposed to be fighting . The mentality of the police according to thenhead of the Chicago PD Richard Brzeczek seems to have been 82208216 .  Chicago judges dismissed the claims as fabrications concocted by desperate prisoners facing either the death penalty or life behind bars in the 1980s . The city often paid out cash settlements to these prisoners 8212 without ever admitting the truth of their allegations . Over the following years allegations by several dozen other prisoners came to light all claiming similar treatment at the hands of the Violent Crimes Unit of South Chicago8217s precinct Areas Two and Three . The orchestrator Jon Burge grew up in the working class Irish communities of southern Chicago and joined the police force in the early 1970s . In the summers Burge would live on his boat hosting cop parties on the waters of Lake Michigan and boast of his ability to break prisoners . Other times they may have been innocent but may well have been forced to take action on a prisoner that were eventually forced into the courts that were forced into taking a prisoner to take a prisoner out of a particular crime of which they were being innocent . New evidence pointing to another suspect's guilt for the murder of the Sanchez murder will free Aaron Patterson from death row now he is hoping the courts will recognize that he was tortured in time to prevent his execution in time for his execution . The new evidence points to new evidence that he is innocent of the crime
---  Pope Francis8217s plea that his apostolic exhortation 8220on love in the family be read 8220patiently and carefully8221 piece by piece and then pondered as a whole . Amoris Laetitia 8220The Joy of Love is by my quick reckoning the longest such document in the history of the papal magisterium and by a good 10 percent or more its sheer size suggests the wisdom 8212 although probably the futility too 8212 of Pope Francis 8212 . Pope Francis begins with a rich reflection on the Bible which as the Pope says 8220is full of families births love stories and family crises8221 Pope Francis then speaks movingly of 8220the majestic early chapters of Genesis8221 . The Bible also speaks of the pain and suffering involved in family life which is like many other sorrows in the human condition which includes many other  sorrows and family struggles8221 But the Bible also speak of the painful and enduring pain of family struggles 8221 The Holy Trinity is a source of comfort and companionship for every family that experiences difficulties 821st century Christians can learn to learn to see the world through a lens by faith they will see the truth about love marriage and the Holy Trinity for 8220  The Christian family is was and always will be countercultural not to be different for difference8217s sake but to offer a model of a nobler way of living That way is rooted in God's original plan for humanity and reaches its perfection in 8220marriage and the family . The pope concludes this section of AL with a prayer 8220I thank God that many families which are far from considering themselves perfect live in love fulfill their calling and keep moving forward even if they may fall many times along the way8221 amp160 . The Pope offers this counsel for those young people scared by the idea of the permanent commitment . Marriage is 8220a failure to realize that only the exclusive and indissoluble union between a man and a woman has a plenary role to play in society as a stable commitment that bears fruit in new life8221 and that ignorance is leading to a legal deconstruction of the family tending to adopt models based almost exclusively on the autonomy of the individual will8221 Justice Anthony Kennedy please call the Vatican yet the bad news is not all the news there is Thus Francis concludes this . Pope concludes this chapter of AL by thanking God that 'God makes what Thomas Aquinas participate which participate in what Thomas the greatest form of participation
---  Wellford Wellford argues that public education funds must be diverted from bloated bureaucracies and redirected into schools where principals teachers and parents can meaningfully influence what is being taught . Wellford is a proposition 8212 one that I hope will spark a lively debate among Truthdig readers and inform policy leaders . Future essays will examine Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa8217s campaign to take over the public schools analyze whether teacher unions can be a force for productive change and expose promising ways to rebuild public investment in the schools . In Los Angeles upwards of 50 of Latino and African American students never finish high school .

The  We must find ways to remove influences that have crippled the schools . Money must be diverted from bloated bureaucracies that snuff out innovation . Parents have a significant role to play in their children8217s education but their voices have been largely silenced . Education in general has been taken from ordinary citizens and teachers by politicians administrators administrators union leaders union leaders and the media each playing its part in keeping alive the illusion of reform . In all this 1trillion industry has replaced the common interest and no one it seems can muster the will to rein it in . The rich get richer and the poor fall ever further behind in crumbling schools, writes Robert Putnam . We need to find ways of removing the influences that cripple the schools. Money must go directly to schools where principals and teachers can influence what is taught and what children learn and help bring parents back into the fold otherwise it is going down a rat hole. We must remove the influences of bureaucracy that snuffed out innovation, says Putnam. We need money to remove the influence of bureaucracy. We have seen the decline of civic involvement in civic involvement and the rise of self-interest over the greater good in education. It is time to stop the dominance of selfinterest over selfinterest, writes Putnam

---  A homeless crisis of unprecedented proportions is rocking the West Coast and its victims are being left behind by soaring housing costs rockbottom vacancy rates and a roaring economy that waits for no one . The rising numbers of homeless people have pushed abject poverty into the open like never before and have overwhelmed cities and nonprofits . The surge in people living on the streets has put public health at risk led several cities to declare states of emergency and forced cities and counties to spend millions in some cases billions in a search for solutions . The West Coasts newly homeless are people who were able to survive on the margins until those margins moved . The median onebedroom apartment in the San Francisco Bay Area is significantly more expensive than it is in the New York City metro area and apartments in San Francisco are listed at a higher price than those in Manhattan . The number of unsheltered homeless population has spiked by 18 percent in the past year . In Anaheim home to Disneyland 400 people sleep along a bike path in the shadow of Angel Stadium 400 people slept along a bicycle path in a parking lot where vendors set up shop in an abandoned building or vehicle . A homeless couple was thrust to the streets because they were unable to get by even if they suffered a setback are now pushed to the the streets  A 5 percent rent increase in Los Angeles for example would mean about 2000 more homeless people there the authors said Nationally homelessness has been trending down partly because governments and nonprofit groups have gotten better at moving people into housing . But the flow the other direction is even faster and on the West Coast shelter systems are smaller . In evershifting communities of homeless RVs and cars cluster by the dozens in the city where Google built its global headquarters and just blocks from Stanford University . The numbers of homeless youth also is rising a recent count in L.A. found that those ages 18 to 24 were the fastestgrowing homeless group by age up 64 percent followed by those under 18 . In Oregon City a suburban working class of 36,000 people the police department added a full-time position for a homeless outreach officer after roughly half a half of the homeless encampments .

---  US lawmakers skeptical of the Trump administration's promise to shield farmers from the rapidly escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China . The White House said it will hold a briefing on Friday about a possible government shutdown as lawmakers face a looming deadline to keep the government funded . US lawmakers and the farm industry were skeptical about the lack of details in protecting the US agricultural export sector now embroiled in the backandforth . The administration has said it would find a way to protect farmers but there were no specific plans yet . Soybean futures have dropped 15 percent over the last five days over the dispute as the dispute has heated up as the United States follows through on Trump8217s latest threat on Thursday to impose tariffs on an extra 100 billion in Chinese goods . China warned it was fully prepared to respond with a 8220fierce counter strike if the US followed through on Thursday . The current bill was passed in 2014 and was expected to cost 489 billion over five years it expires at the end of 2018 it is up for renewal this year but it is unclear what options the White House chooses to protect the sector . Soybeans futures have been suggested over the five days last week. Soybeans have dropped over five days. Soybean Futures have dropped  Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng called the US action 8220extremely mistaken8221 and unjustified adding that the spat was a struggle between unilateralism and multilateralism . China said it was not afraid of a trade war even though it did not seek one and accused the United States of provoking the conflict . Financial markets have been roiled by the prospect of threats becoming action and US stocks tumbled on Friday as investors worried about an escalating trade war . China has already fully prepared and will not hesitate to immediately make a fierce counter strike if the U.S. announces an additional 100 billion list of tariffs China will follow suit . On Chinese social media Friday among the most searched phrases were 8220 and 8220 on US retaliation8221 against earlier US trade actions had upped the ante on Thursday by ordering US officials to identify extra tariffs . China is expected to unveil reform measures next week and its country expected to open up financial services next week . US information technology products from mobile phones to personal computers have largely escaped the ire of Beijing as well as telecoms equipment and aircraft larger than the equivalent of a Boeing 737 larger than Boeing 737 .

---  President Donald Trump ousted Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin in response to heavy criticism and nominated his personal physician Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson to replace him in the latest turnover among Trump8217s team . White House officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Shulkins had become a distraction due to a constant wave of speculation about his future and said he would be leaving in the next day or two . An undersecretary at the Department of Defense Robert Wilkie will be the acting secretary . Jackson is highly trained and qualified and as a service member himself he has seen firsthand the tremendous sacrifice our veterans make and has a deep appreciation for the debt our great country owes them8221 Trump said . Jackson a rear admiral of the US Navy has been working as a presidential physician since the George W Bush administration and has been the lead doctor monitoring Trump's health since Trump became president . Jackson gave Trump a clean bill of health early this year after giving the president a physical . He put him on a diet to lose some weight and directed him to get some exercise .

---  Canadian veteran Dennis Moore recalls the day he was plucked from the front lines of the Korean War to play ice hockey 66 years ago . Moore and fellow veteran Claude Charland were taking part in an event organised by the Canadian Embassy and the city of Paju to commemorate the Imjin River games . Moore was chosen to play for the Princess Patricia8217s Canadian Light Infantry regiment while Charland played for the Royal 22e Regiment known as the Van Doos . Moore said: "In 1952 never in my wildest dreams did I think I8217d be right here right now" The games could have become a forgotten piece of Canada's wartime history had it not been for an old black and white photograph of a rink hanging on the wall of a bar in Seoul . An annual tournament in honour of the troops has since become an annual event featuring members of the same Canadian regiments that played against each other during the war . The two Koreas remain divided both Moore and Charland said they hoped to see the day when the country is reunited 8217s Winter Games in Pyeongchang .

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the entire country was in shock and mourning as details of the tragedy emerged . For some the tragedy revived painful memories of a bus crash in the province in December 1986 that killed four young players from the Swift Current Broncos ice hockey team . An online fundraising campaign for the affected players and their families was set up late on Friday by the mother of a former Broncos teammate with an initial target of 10000 by Saturday evening it had raised more than 21 million .

---  Last time the morbidly rich had this much power in American politics was the 1920s when an orgy of taxcutting and deregulation of banking led to the Republican Great Depression Franklin Delano Roosevelt stepped up to challenge those he called the Economic Royalists . FDR explicitly explicitly called for the overthrow of this kind of power . From 1932 until 1980 American politicians knew how important it was for government representing the best interests of both our nation and the Morbidly Rich could marshal with their great wealth . Big corporations and wealthy businesspeople largely stayed away from politics from the 1930s onward not wanting to draw the ire of the American people . Until 1971 in August of that year Lewis Powell a lawyer who largely defended tobacco and the interests of the Virginia8217s upper classes wrote an apocalyptic memoamp160 to his neighbor and friend who was the head of the US Chamber of Commerce . Powell proposed a small group to reshape American public opinion through think tanks and at least the political parties . Take over the media for an assault on the very wealthy people for an allout allout of very wealthy . Take one out of one of very powerful media and an assault of courts and courts in 2016 in the most indelible mark on the nation was not to be his mark on  Lewis Powell's memo was a direct response to Roosevelt's battle cry decades earlier and a response to the tumult of the 19608217s He wrote 8220No thoughtful person can question that the American economic system is under broad attack . Powell recommended a militant political action program ranging from the courts to the campuses . The objective was simple The revival of a Royalistcontrolled socalled socalled 8220free market8221 system Or as Powell put it using Royalist rhetoric 8220The ultimate issue8230is the survival of what we call the free enterprise system and all that this means for the strength and prosperity of America and the freedom of our people8221 The first area of attack Powell encouraged the Chamber to focus on was the education system 8220A priority task of business8212and organizations such as the Chamber8212is to address the campus origin of this hostility to big business8221 Powell wrote . In the nearly6000word memo Powell called on corporate leaders to launch an economic and ideological assault on college and high school campuses the media, the media and the courts and Capitol Hill . The Chamber should consider establishing a staff of highly qualified scholars in the social sciences in the academic world . The staff of scholars should evaluate social science textbooks in political science and sociology
---  The Trump administration is holding talks on providing nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia 8212 A move that critics say could upend decades of US policy and lead to an arms race in the Middle East . The Saudi government wants nuclear power to free up more oil for export but current and former American officials suspect the country also wants to keep up with the enrichment capabilities of their rival Iran . Past negotiations broke down because the Saudi government wouldn't commit to certain safeguards against eventually using the technology for weapons . Now the Trump administration has reopened those talks and might not insist on the same precautions . Abandoning the safeguards would set up a showdown with powerful skeptics in Congress . The Saudis have a legitimate reason to want nuclear power Their domestic energy demand is growing rapidly and burning crude oil is an expensive and inefficient way to generate electricity There8217s also an obvious political motive . The technology for nuclear weapons is different from that for nuclear energy but there is some overlap but experts believe the Saudis aren8217t currently trying to develop a nuclear nuclear weapons but want to lay the groundwork to do so in case Iran develops a nuclear bomb in Iran develops one in case the Saudis want to match Iran with the nuclear energy . US policy not to spread the technology to spread it to other countries .  Copson8217s was telling people he had a group of US European Arab and Russian companies that would build as many as 40 nuclear reactors in Egypt Jordan and Saudi Arabia . Flynn flew to Egypt to convince officials there to hold off on a Russian offer this one unrelated to ACU to build nuclear power plants . Flynn tried to persuade the Egyptian government to consider Copson's proposal instead according to documents released by Rep Elijah Cummings the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . Flynn's trip would later present legal problems for Flynn because he didn8217t report contacts with foreign officials on his application to renew his security clearance on his new security clearance according to Cummings . IP3 International found an ally in Tom Barrack the new president's close friend and informal adviser and an ultrawealthy investor in his own right . Barrack was dazzled by Bud McFarlane and his IP3 colleagues . IP38217s idea was a variation on ACU8217's idea of nuclear power as an option for the Mideast nuclear power plan . The idea resonated with the US nuclearconstruction industry which never recovered from the Three Mile Island disaster in the 1970s and was looking to new markets overseas but nuclear exports are tightly controlled because the technology is potentially so dangerous
---  Revisionist leader Ze8217ev Jabotinsky was the founder of the school which favours military solutions to any conflict . The other school is the school of reconciliation adhered to by moderate Zionists like Moshe Sharet . Israeli manoeuvres and operations in the 1948 war give a clear picture of their endorsement of a military option together with a denial of any possible diplomatic solution . In 1953 Palestinians crossed the Israeli border near the Jordanian village of Quibya and murdered a Jewish mother and her two children in a raid . The Israeli military and political leaders soon defined the criterion by which to measure success . Success of the Israeli offensive strategy was measured by the extent to which the Arab willingness to fight decreased This pattern was already evident in the early stages of the . 1948 war a war in which the Israelis violated the human rights of Palestinian civilians . In the early Fifties Israel had managed further to refine this offensive doctrine . The raid was a complete success. The Israeli raid was the first in a chain of reprisals carried out by the Israeli . raids carried out in a new form of murderous art . These raids shaped Israeli offensive tactics into a new Israeli offensive doctrine. In 1953 the . Israeli offensive . raids shaped into a . new . Israeli military  Israeli Prime Ministers actually love to be condemned by the international community . Any foreign criticism of Israel is interpreted as the pathological antisemitic behaviour of gentiles . Israeli politician learn to use this tool early in their careers to use as a tool . In the Israeli case the offensive doctrine leaves the international world powerless . This may explain the continuous shift to the right in Israeli politics . The Israeli offensive doctrine does not dissociate between Arabs . From the perspective of the 8216Iron Wall all Arabs are the same . Israel has managed to lose its 8216 power of the Middle East in terms of deterrence and deterrence . In other words, the Israeli army is totally defeated by the shadow of Hbulah in Lebanon in the Mideast in the shadows of HBulah . The shadow of the shadow is not yet clear as the Israeli war is not completely over. While being in the Israeli forces are almost twenty years to get out of the Israeli Army is a small group of guilla fighters in the shadow. The Israeli forces have managed to successfully take out twenty years of the Shadow of the Hizbulah. In the shadow . In terms of the .

The accessories of the season big DoubleD belt buckles and sequin neck scarves for men or shiny sequin cuffs for women gave an edge to the usual boho styling The accessories were more likely a runway gimmick than a commercial proposition .

---  Prime Minister Theresa May8217s response to Russia after a nerve agent attack on British soil is unlikely to trouble Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin unduly despite the expression of outrage that greeted it in Moscow . May expelled 23 Russian spies using diplomatic cover and promised to freeze Russian State assets if they were used to threaten British interests . May also said Britain would work on new powers to defend against hostile state activity beef up counter espionage powers and cut back official participation in the soccer World Cup . But her announcement just days before an election in which Putin a former KGB officer is expected to coast to a fourth term . London remains open to Russian investment albeit with a political chill . Russia denied any involvement in the attack and simply declined to say anything about how a Sovietera nerve toxin ended up striking down a former double agent on the normally genteel streets of the English city of Salisbury . The foreign ministry described May’s nerve toxin struck down Sergei Skripal in the . city of . Salisbury’Sripal a former GRU military intelligence officer who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to MI6 was a test for Britain after years of turning a blind eye to the reality of modern Russia Part of that policy is due to money One of the biggest exports  Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district is so Republican that Democrats did not even field candidates in the previous two US House elections . Lamb's strong showing could buoy Democrats nationally as they seek to win control of the US House of Representatives from Republicans in the November elections . Democratic donors and strategists have been anxious about high levels of enthusiasm on the Democratic side and have emphasized the need to motivate Republican voters to turn out to retain the party8217s grip on the US Senate and House . US Representative Carlos Curbelo a Republican from Florida said the Pennsylvania race showed that lawmakers should be willing to buck their own leadership on certain issues or work across the aisle . A Lamb win could vindicate a strategy Democrats are using in some races to enlist candidates whose positions and ideologies are well suited to the district even while conflicting in significant ways with the positions of the Democratic leadership in Washington . Lamb advocated for gun rights and said Representative Nancy Pelosi should be replaced as House Democratic leader making it harder than expected for Republicans to attack some of his positions . The Pennsylvania race may be seen as a template for the Democrats to flip certain Republican seats that went for Trump Saccone . The race is worrying for Republicans who were sure that tax cuts the party's only major legislative achievement under Trump
---  A new state assessment for kindergarteners could be piloted as early as fall 2012 It will likely be based on teacher observations of student behavior and learning . The notion that kindergarten should be betteraligned with preschool isn't new It was touted in a National Education Goals Panel report among others in the 1990s as well as in a 1988 National Association of State Boards of Education report 8220Right from the Start . The idea is gaining more traction with early childhood experts and policymakers who stress the need to help children transition smoothly to kindergarten and the primary grades to set a firm foundation for successamp160 Yet a number of hurdles stand in the way . There are no system in place to make sure that teachers and schools get information from these institutions that would help them ease the transition . School choice has made it more challenging for some schools to know exactly who will be enrolling in kindergarten from year to year The district has no money specifically targeted toward transition activities . There is also a plan to launch a website with parents to give parents educational games and online educational games to help parents and teachers to give their primary children a better picture of student learning . Some teachers say the sheer newness of the environment can throw children for a loop and the lack of continuity can cause more than disoriented students  The New Schools Project was launched in 2002 about 20 schools have participated with teachers receiving a wide range of training . An instructional coach spends one to three days a week at the school leading workshops on topics such as independent reading time for children and giving teachers feedback on their teaching . The number of schools participating is down from 11 last year because of funding constraints the Project hopes to add more schools in the fall . The Project's approach works best when schools don8217t have rigid gradelevel structures when teacher teams are given decisionmaking power and when preschool programs and fullday kindergarten are available The Academy for Urban School Leadership has adopted the Project8217s approach . Chicago's childparent centers offer preschool and kindergarten in the same location parent engagement staff that focus on improving student attendance and an aligned curriculum and lowered class sizes through 3rd grade . The Ouncerece Fundare Educare Fundare is funded by the Erikson Institute and in some cases the project is covered by foundations the Erikon Institute . The project's director Sam Meisels said that the approach is best for schools to build on the preschoolthrough3rdgrade approach of Chicago8217's approach . The program is based on the Chicago childparent center which offers preschool and kindergartners

She co-founded the Act Together Women in Black Women8217s Action for Iraq . Her new book is that the multifaceted stories collected here will directlyate different different different attitudes towards the present and visions about the future of the new Iraq . The book is a rich and contradictory narrative that begins with the premise that Iraq's postcolonial postcolonial history against the late1940s or colonial postcolonial histories against the author . It is a truancyismismism that ignorance of ignorance of Middle East women held even by 8220s or alternative histories that is a sure guarantee that its worst features will reappear . It begins with a rich narrative to yield a rich, contradictory oralternative histories against colonial post-colonial post orcolonial post- colonial histories against Iraq.

AlAli is particularly bitter about that period during which hundreds of thousands of Iraqis among them 500,000 children died of malnutrition and want of medicine . She doesn't engage in long fulminations against the US and the West here which may disappoint some readers but the judgment is implicit .

---  The latest wave of people8217s movement is in fact the continuation of a centurylong struggle though it may have burst onto the scene seemingly out of nowhere . The socalled Reformist faction of the ruling class in Iran our equivalent of the Democratic Party in the US had already reached its conclusions years before this latest uprising . The World Bank has approved of the current regime of neoliberalism and austerity that the Iranian government has been instituting in systematic and progressive steps since the 1990s . The IMF has issued its recommendations for reforms of the banking system and it has warned about the troublesome ramifications of the totally unregulated banking sector that has been operating at an industrial scale in Iran stealing precious little or notsolittle savings people might have put away . Since the lifting of the sanctions most of the economic growth have gone mostly to the rich and the connected . The rich in Iran just like the rich in the U.S. really like to throw it in your face about how sweet they got it in Iran . If you support the Islamic Republic these rich kids are the people you8217re supporting the regime, you're the people who have got it good in Iran not the majority, says the author . The author of this article: "These are the rich kids  Iran is a society rich in resources and with incomes from oil gas and petrochemical sales worth tens upon tens of billions of dollars in the past two years since the nuclear deal was struck . The economic and trade sanctions that were imposed by western powers in fact strengthened the regime8217s hold on power while at the same time impoverishing the working classes . The state also has a monopoly on smuggled goods both into and out of Iran including cigarettes drugs and alcoholic beverages all of which can literally be delivered to your house if you have the means . Poverty in Iran is suffered by almost half the population the youth comprise half of the population and youth unemployment is estimated at 40 . The social contradictions that sent Iranian people onto the streets are deepening and finding the population on a regular basis are a deepening . Those hopeful that this monstrous character that suffocating our people may be catching their breaths now may be caught their breaths right now, says Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad8217 . Iran is going to forever be caught up again and again since 1905 and we have risen up again in the last decade or two decades or three decades of upheavals are also marked by smaller upheavalings and dispersed in smaller and dispersed by smaller and recurrent upheavations .
---  Two recent articles in the New York Times by Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Jim Yardley draw attention to the mounting political crisis in Nepal . They point out that the fundamental problem is 8220the unresolved task of merging the two enemy armies8221 mandated by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed by the Maoists and the government in November 2006 . The interim constitution composed in January 2007 will expire on May 28 when a new one authored by the Constituent Assembly is supposed to go into effect . But the writing of the new constitution has not been completed and the peace agreement may fall by the wayside in a few months Yardley indicates that both parties are at fault for the impasse . The Maoists have maneuvered to keep their army intact as a bargaining chip to influence the constitutional negotiations at the same time the Nepalese Army which before 2006 answered to the king now deposed has grudgingly succumbed to civilian control . The king was highly unpopular in part because of the rebels dismissed the parliament and assumed full martial law and dismissed the cabinet and declared martial law . In February 2005 King Gyanendra declared the government declared the coup and declared the king declared full-martial law and assumed martial law, the king assumed full executive powers and assumedFull Martial Law .  The Maoists used the opportunity to expand their political base in the city among its workers and middle class . Maoists were very conscious of the fact they had not seized state power in the MarxistLeninist sense . They had indeed entered a power structure that they might use towards their revolutionary goals but it was one not entirely amenable to their objectives . The officer corps of the Royal Nepali Army after May 2008 have not been happy campers in this revolutionary period . Most are themselves of high caste many intermarried with the royal family indoctrinated with their own ideology of loyalty to the King . They have violated the terms of the Comprehensive Agreement recruiting new soldiers since 2006 and importing arms . The United Nations Mission in Nepal UNMIN has confirmed this and protested to the Nepalese government Prime Minister Prachanda tried to fire the Army chief in May 2009 for insubordination due to his unwillingness to comply with the terms with the agreement . The current Maoists call the current regime illegitimate because it reflects the current Maoist influence of the political influence of . the political power of the Nepali army and being swayed by . the . Maoist regime . The Maoist Party calls the current military supremacy illegitimate because . it reflects that they are trying to bring it down .

In 2007 after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto I communicated with Farooq Tariq the secretary general of the Labour Party of Pakistan LPP . After the recent events I got back in touch with him what follows is an exchange conducted the past couple of days March 1617 2009 between myself and Mr Tariqi . To begin can you give the readers an idea of what is transpiring in Pakistan in Pakistan In your description can you identify the parties and prominent individuals involved . The main political parties that were in the forefront of this struggle are Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz Tehreek Insaaf Justice Party in this movement .

They were arrested but stood firm . Imran Khan a former Pakistan cricket team captain has emerged as the most popular personality of the movement  The PPP is losing its support rapidly and losing it support rapidly . The party is not finished but is losing support rapidly It will remain as a major party unless another party replaces them with a revolutionary programme . The PMLN can never replace the PPP but it can never have the permanent support of the people because the nature of the PMNN is almost the same as PPP Both are right wing bourgeoisie parties with populist appeal at some times There is no possibility of PPP taking a Left route The reason is very simple PPP leadership from top to bottom is committed to power and to certain people . They have proved again that they are committed to the interests of the ruling class and imperialism and imperialism are not for the majority of people . All the gesture of gesture of the gesture will serve the leftist ideas and will serve even abandoned the scene It will even even abandoned leftist ideas It will serve as the . All of the parties have abandoned the left and will be able to serve the people’s space but that is a breathing space that is already lost already. All the time it is losing it but that that is breathing space but it is already breathing space in Swatan but that has already lost it already . The . PPP gave it a death

---  Gary Webb's 8220Dark Alliance8221 article in the San Jose Mercury News was published August 18 1996 . The story was headlined "The CIA and Crack Evidence Is Lacking of Allegations of Alleged Plot" A picture of a man smoking crack superimposed upon the seal of the CIA drew itself on the screen after more than a year of work . The establishment papers that had so confidently reported in the 1980s that there was no truth to these claims of Contra drug trafficking8212remained largely silent . The Washington Post had just moved a story on the wires It would be in the morning edition 10496 and it was highly critical of the series He asked me to take a look at it and give him my reaction . In early October he was in New York City getting ready for an appearance on the Montel Williams Show which was doing a twoday special on the 8220 dark Alliance series . In May 1986 his office had planted a false story in the New York Times 5786 stating that the Justice Department had cleared the Contras of any involvement in gun running and drug smuggling a statement the Justice Dept.

The LA Times and New York Times both ran long stories attacking my reporting and the series . The papers found no need to mention the mass of historical evidence that supported the series8217 findings without anything approaching documentation the papers just flatly declared that I was wrong 8220 The crack epidemic in Los Angeles followed no blueprint or master plan It was not orchestrated by the Contras or the CIA or the drug trade, the papers said . The Post held the letter for weeks ordered him to rewrite it and then refused to print it . The Times asked the CIA if it had ever done such a thing When the CIA said 8216no8217 the papers solemnly printed it8212 just as though the papers had previously denied any number of illegal operations in which it was later caught redhanded . The CIA hadn't ever denied any of the illegal operations that it was caught and not put into it into it’s not put on the story and the story was not put back by the CIA. The papers refused to publish the letter until the Post held it for weeks and refused to re-write it
---  If new legislation known as the Mother8217s Act becomes law the drugging of infants through pregnant and nursing mothers will no doubt increase Congress has rightfully refused to pass this bill for eight years . The bill was obviously written by the Big Pharma lobby and its passage into law would be laughable except that it is actually happening . The Act has the net affect of reclassifying the natural process of pregnancy and birth as a mental disorder that requires the use of unproven and extremely dangerous psychotropic medications which can also easily harm the child . The newly recruited customers will be stigmatized for life with labels of the most serious forms of mental illness simply because they are unlucky enough to become pregnant in the United States where serious disorders lead to major profits from the prescribing of multiple classes of psychotropic drugs . Many of the same exact symptoms are listed as side effects on the warning labels for antidepressants antipsychotics and anticonvulsants . The drugs are now being prescribed to treat the psychiatric drugs . The same exact 8220symptoms are listed on the side effects of the drugs that are listed in the warning lists on the labels for anti-psychiatric antipsychotic antipsychothetic and anti-epidemic drugs .

Drugs that can cause horrific side effects including suicidal behavior violence and devastating birth defects . Dr Levine: "There is no evidence that antidepressant use by depressed mothers lowers their likelihood of suicide" Dr Levine also says there is a great deal of evidence that . antidepressant use can make some people manic agitated and violent8221 Dr Levine .

---  War began in 2002 under intense US pressure with piecemeal military action in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas FATA . Afghan Taliban were using the region to regroup after their earlier rout . In the past month there have been at least three suicide bombings and four rocket attacks most targeting Hayatabad . Peshawar was a sanctuary as Afghanistan was perpetually at war . Now many Afghans are leaving because Afghanistan feels safer in Peshawar because it feels safer . The Taliban are a phantom enemy invented by the establishment to justify foreign aid, says Name Name . The government is creating the enemy that it claims it is actually the enemy it actually claims it was at war with it . The war also spilled into the mainland mainland into the region and culminated in the army incursion this year into the Swat valley and followed the failure of the peace settlement of a peace settlement following the operation of the settlement of the Namear Namead. The government claims it had a failure of a settlement of Nameam Name. The Taliban were a failure to claim it is a failure that it is the enemy. The Afghan Taliban are the enemy . The Afghan war is also a failure. The Pakistani government has never been able to take on proPakistan Afghans.  In 2005 Muhammad8217s soninlaw Mullah Fazlullah was able to revive TNSM with a more radical edge . With unemployment easy access to weaponry and training and rising political consciousness there was no shortage of angry young men to swell the Taliban ranks . Asif Ezdi a political analyst was 8220 because the state has failed the youth massively and comprehensively . The wellspring of Islamic militancy in Pakistan is to be found in the alienation of the mass of the population by a ruling elite that has used the state to protect and expand its own privileges pushing the common man into deeper and deeper poverty and hopelessness . The Taliban had neither the capacity nor the intention to invade the capital saying there was limited to their influence in the Malakand division and there was only three divisions of its division and their limited influence to the three divisions . The government was only interested in the area and there were no more than 5000 Taliban were controlling Swat and they entered Buner valley they had entered the Buner Valley they entered the area they entered it in 2005 . The Pakistani government failed to provide assistance and much of the foreign aid money lined the pockets of corrupt officials. The Taliban could have spared to march on the capital. The government could not have spared
---  Western powers said on Saturday their missile attacks struck at the heart of Syria8217s chemical weapons program but the restrained assault appeared unlikely to halt Syrian President Bashar alAssad8217's progress in the 7-year-old civil war . US President Donald Trump called the operation a success and proclaimed on Twitter that mission accomplished . The Western countries said the strikes were aimed at preventing more Syrian chemical weapons attacks after a suspected poison gas attack in Douma on April 7 killed up to 75 people . Syria released video of the wreckage of a bombedout research lab but also of Assad arriving at work as usual with the caption 8220Morning of resilience8221 Late on Saturday Syria time a large explosion was heard in a Syrian governmentcontrolled area in a rural region south of Aleppo according to the Britainbased war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights The Observatory said the cause of the explosion was unknown as well as its target . Syria and its allies also made clear that they considered the attack a oneoff unlikely to do meaningful harm to Assad . The U.S. Vice President Mike Pence seemed less sure of the use of sarin saying that Washington may well determine that it was used along with chlorine use in Syria attack . The US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said  Russia has denied any gas attack took place in Douma and accused Britain of staging it to whip up antiRussian hysteria . Western countries took precautions to avoid unexpected conflict with Russia . OPCW were due to try to visit Douma on Saturday to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack . Russia condemned the Western states for refusing to wait for their findings . The Western assault involved more missiles than a US attack last year but struck targets limited to Syria8217s chemical weapons facilities . Syria agreed in 2013 to give up its chemical weapons after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people . The US intervention last year had effectively no impact on the war .

---  House Armed Services Committee Staff Director Erin Conaton declared in a memo to committee staffers that the powerful committee was scrapping the Bush Administration shop worn phrase Global War of Terrorism . Recent research in Lebanon has turned up information previously unavailable which sheds light of the misapplication of the Terrorism label by the Bush administration . The 8221 T word8221 is often misapplied as former National Security Advisor Brzezinski reminds us as he tours the country promoting his new book Second Chance . There is considerable doubt among international lawyers whether Hezbollah should ever have been classified as a terrorist organization . At the urging of US and Israel Canada classifies Hezbollah as terrorist organization which limits the group8217s ability to raise funds and travel internationally AIPAC is working to remove Hezbollah from the Terrorism list in Canada . Israel appears to determine who is on the US State Department Terrorism list Israel determines who are on the list . The case against Hezbollah for the State Department is virtually identical to one drafted by a draft State Department draft . It appears on a draft draft State Dept. case against a draft state sheet . It also appears on U.S. State Department terrorism list . It is similar to Al Qaeda in a type of Islamist Terrorism similar to Hamas in the context of Al Qaeda .  The goal of these new groups in the 19808217s was to drive Israel and its foreign sponsors from Lebanon . Many groups adapted and acted because no single force power or obstacle stood in their way . Some of the groups admitting their actions at various times were The Organization of Socialist Revolutionary Work the Armed Revolutionary Factions in Lebanon Islamic Jihad the Organization of the Oppressed in the World the Revolutionary Justice Organization Holy Warriors for Freedom the Khaibar Brigade the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine the Blessed Resistance the Islamic Liberation Organization the Organization . Thousands were kidnapped many by Israel and their allies and hundreds are still unaccounted for . An exhaustive review by American researchers of the nearly 80 Western kidnapping cases organized by a staggering variety of groups in Lebanon between 1975 and 1990 concluded that more than 100 Western detainees were taken released killed killed or exchanged or exchanged . More than 100 western detainees were kidnapped and many are still missing .

---  The failure to anticipate the September 11 attack is merely the latest in a long series of CIA blunders over the past half century US presidents have accepted the poor performance of the CIA presumably because the agency represents a clandestine and relatively inexpensive instrument of American foreign policy . The CIA has been particularly weak on terrorism in the United States and politicizing the intelligence data process in the U.S. The agency has taken on a worst flavor to exaggerating the national security threat to exaggerate the threat to national security, exaggerating national security threats to the worst case of a terrorist attack . This is an excerpt from the excellent new book PowerTrip US Unilateralism and Global Strategy After September 11 part of the Open Media series published by Seven Stories Press . The book is edited by John Feffer and includes essays by writers and scholars from Foreign Policy in Focus including William Hartung Martha Honey and Ahmed Rashid . The essays are edited by Jonathan Feffer. The book also includes essays from William H. Honey, William Hirstung. The essays include William Hirdung, Martha Honey, Ahmed Rashidi, William RGA and William Hockock. The essay includes essays and essays by William Rung, William Joonoon and William Ruckuck.  September 11 exposed the inability of analysts and agents to perform strategic analysis challenge flawed assumptions and share sensitive secrets . CIA was tracking alQaeda operatives but never placed them on immigration service watch list . CIA has an operational mission to collect human intelligence and analyze and publish national intelligence estimates It is also responsible for covert action . CIA director George Tenet is serving the policy interests of the Bush administration in other ways resorting to worstcase analysis to describe the threats that confront the United States in order to justify the deployment of a national missile defense . Bush administration8217s global policy of unilateralism has involved the CIA in controversial covert operations including political assassinations despite the ban since 1975 on such actions by presidential executive order . There are no political and ethical guidelines to engage in covert action when engaging in covert actions . CIA remains a dangerously unregulated activity . CIA and FBI cannot perform both covert action and the CIA's second major major mission like every other major mission since Gerald Gerald Contreinos and other presidents since Gerald Ford have been like Gerald Nixon . The CIA has a long history of poor communication and poor communication between the CIA and the FBI having a long-term covert action. The CIA is not allowed to engage into such covert actions. CIA has no political or ethical guidelines when
---  The revolutionary days of December 19 and 20 have ushered in a revolutionary phase in Argentina . A series of three revolutionary events shattered the country to its foundations bringing down De la Ras government . These bore the marks that Lenin highlighted as the hallmark for such situations amp160an exceptional situation in which the ruling classes are no longer able to rule as they did thus having to change their normal ways of domination for exceptional ones amp160a considerable intensification due to such causes of the activity of the masses . We do not share in the least the view of those superficially claiming that what we have seen is a victorious revolution . We draw a certain analogy with the Spanish events in the 30s sparked by the downfall of the king that culminated in the civil war that ended in the downfall that culminated with the downfall . The tempo of the revolution might well change as the events are unfolding but nevertheless one should always bear in mind a given perspective so that one will be able to make any necessary corrections with it through the revolutionary phase to make necessary corrections in tune with the revolutionary denouement to it through its revolutionary phase . It is unlikely that Argentina will come a revolutionary process . Its tempo is likely to come a quick-denouement of the 30’s sparked off  The Spanish Communist Party has come into the fray in a state of extreme weakness Spain is not at war the Spanish peasants are not rallied in the barracks and the trenches in their millions nor are facing the immediate danger of extermination . As it happened in Spain back then it is least likely that the Argentine process will come to a quick denouement . We can state as Nin did when referring to the Spanish events in the 30s that we are in for a protracted and painstaking process during which the masses try to find a way forward in a struggle fraught with difficulties chaotic actions chaotic actions partial offensives victories and defeats . The working class is responding to the crisis unevenly The unemployed have mobilized much faster demanding the job schemes they were promised The government might try and incorporate some of its sectors . The government may try and . try to implement the already announced increase in job schemes although a tug of war as to their distribution might ensue also More than ever before the progressive nature of the picketers movements lie in their ability to fight for genuine jobs and not merely demanding workfare schemes . In the future we shall see fights against wage arrears and if inflation rises we shall hear fights against . wage losses and if . inflation rises . We shall see fighting against wage loss

One of the key organizations funded by a Kochcontrolled foundation is Americans for Prosperity AFP AFP AFP . AFP is also a veritable smorgasbord of other 8220grassroots personalities . AFP or AFP Foundation has spawned the following identities: DefendingtheDreamorg, SayNoCapandTradeorg and SickofSpendingcom . Right wing foundations are funding another nonprofit the State Policy Network which says it has free market think tanks in every state . The work of most of the groups is to push for privatization of public services and public schools .

More than 800 people were killed 8212 often hacked to death with machetes during the night 8212 around the town of Beni near the border with Uganda between 2014 and 2016 Congolese authorities say the Allied Democratic Forces ADF a Ugandan Islamist group active in the area were behind the killings . A report by New York University8217s Congo Research Group published last year found that senior army officers including the former top general in the zone supported and in some cases organized the killings and collaborated with local fighters . During the 17 months of trials the mobile military tribunal only convicted one army officer a colonel a colonel He was sentenced to a fouryear jail term .

Governor Bush says he respects his position and will be mindful of the fact that you have this position and you should respect mine as well . He says he has a duty to uphold the law and he has every right to change the law . Bonowitz: I have absolutely no doubt that the people were guilty and there is a new witness in Amos King8217 case that corroborates part of his story .

It is the only governors
---  It8217s remarkable how rarely Israel is mentioned in regard to the American plans to attack Iraq . A proper assessment of its part in this war depends upon an understanding of Israel's position in the United States8217 overall policy for the Middle East and how that policy is being implemented with specific regard to Iraq . Consistent USIsraeli policy has been largely successful in destroying Arab nationalism as it existed two generations ago and replacing it with religious fundamentalism . Israel has perhaps the third strongest military in the world with hundreds of advanced nuclear weapons Israel did not sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty missiles and submarines with which to deliver them and an air force of USsupplied F16s and attack helicopters . For that reason too the US is willing to support Israel’s brutal and racist occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and its settlement of its citizens in the occupied territories condemned by the United Nations thirtyfive years ago in Security Council Resolution 242 and its occupation of its occupied territories recognized as a war crime 8212 a war . Israel is also willing to fund Hamas and even the Islamicist movements even the Hamas and Islamicist groups that counter counters to Hamas and the Mujahideen that they saw on occasion on occasion . The US has never in fact required Mideast  Israeli governments whether Labor or Likud do nothing without approval of their American paymasters . US financial and military aid to Turkey was used brutally to suppress the Kurds in the southeast in the 1990s . US and its clients in the Middle East have as their enemies whole peoples of the region . Any understanding of Israel's role in the coming US attack on Iraq has to begin with the Jewish state8217s continuing position in US policy . Chomsky refers to Israel as 8220virtually an offshore US military establishment8221 and that army is 8220almost an offshoot of the Pentagon8221 Chomsky adds He points out that there are many such cases like Eisenhower ordering Israel out of Egyptian territory on the eve of a presidential election . Israel carried out the bidding of its patron in the 1970s at the request of the Carter administration Israel transferred warplanes to Indonesia to aid in the suppression of the East Timorese a massacre comparable to those in Cambodia . In the 1980s Israeli military advisors aided the Reagan administration in genocidal campaigns in Guatemala for which Clinton later apologized with monstrous inadequacy Chomsky points out he points out . Israel's military usefulness to the US is not limited to the M.S. military usefulness is not only to the . Middle East
---  Catalyst Chicago began to examine that complex question in 8220The College Challenge8221 six years ago . Catalyst checks in with five of the nine students to find out whether they graduated and if so what made the difference in helping them surmount the hurdles . Just 45 percent of CPS graduates who enroll in a fouryear college end up with a bachelor8217s degree within six years compared to 64 percent nationally according to a 2006 study from the Consortium on Chicago School Research . Despite the heavy financial burden Brooke Ray graduated from the University of Southern California in 2005 with a major in international relations and a minor in business . Vernon Payne had a rocky start as a student at Morgan Park High School who did only enough schoolwork to get by by attending Columbia College in fine arts and was a talented artist but a mediocre student but a talented student who did not get by enough school work . He vowed to make school a priority in 2002 when he spoke with Catalyst with the help of his family and teachers encouraged him to enroll for its arts programs at Columbia College College in 2006 . Now he wants to start a marketing company to build Web sites for small businesses a dream he has had since high school and wants to own his own business one day . The district has taken steps to boost college admissions  In 2002 Adam Ramirez was a senior at Roosevelt University earning top grades and about to earn a degree in elementary education . Adam Ramirez says he achieved success in college despite poor preparation in high school because he discovered his ethnic identity as a Native American . Pilsen Ana Salinas came a big surprise to her when she failed a precalculus class at Juarez High School during her first semester at L.A. Soola failed a preculus class and took Advanced Placement classes at Columbia College in the South Loop . At the time of her first attempt at college she took a chance on an art supply and frame store in Morgan Park and earned a 29 GPA . Now she hopes to pursue a graduate degree in art and has plans to launch her own business an online art supply store down the road he hopes to work in school administration . In 2003 Adam Ramirez is now teaching 7th and 8thgrade math and reading at Eberhart Elementary in Chicago Lawn where he started in 2004 . He says he has been disappointed because of a perceived lack of compassion for students among his colleagues among students among colleagues . Ramirez: "I don't think any school prepares you for the actual teaching experience and the issues these kids are bringing into the classroom. I have to keep teaching
---  Hatred of US foreign policies intensifies day by day in much of the world but the present administration is not even examining the possibility of changing those policies to allay the hatred and reduce the likelihood of future terrorism . Instead the response of the Bush administration is to dig in its heels militarize the nation beyond rationality move toward preemptive warfare as a firstchoice instrument of national policy . With the alleged aim of enhancing internal security it is taking the first steps down a path that could easily convert the government itself into a dictatorship8211a dictatorship . The strongest motivating force in Bush administration these days is probably the desire to strengthen the Republican Party8217s position in Congress this fall followed immediately by the hope of winning an untarnished nationwide majority in Bush’s own reelection effort in 2004 . New pressures from inside the US however could be considerably more effective . The task is not impossible Those who are willing to change their beliefs are not impossible and there are many more people like ours with there are often more willing to do so . We need to start a campaign to influence voters to support new policies and to give over all of us who want to change our society and our society, writes Peter Bergen . For those who think the exercise is doomed because  We should oppose establishment of a Department of Homeland Security . We should press for immediate congressional revisions of the USA Patriot Act to abrogate all provisions therein that the ACLU opposes . The ACLU should emphasize Let8217s see more proposals from others We should urge US voters to oppose the Bush administration's drive for global hegemony and domination . The Bush approach of 8220what we say goes8221 increases worldwide hatreds of the US and in no way benefits a majority of Americans . This is neither necessary nor desirable nor worth the ultimate goal of US foreign policy is worth the cost of money or in terms of money in terms that will be sacrificed in the end of the war . The US has markedly accelerated its pursuit of global political domination and its own version of bigcorporation economic globalization since the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago . The benefits of this domination accrue almost exclusively to the corporate structure that really runs this country and its military and governmental supporters who provide security for the corporate . The U.S. should emphasize this fact to fact to the United States . The true cause however and fact should be the ultimate fact to U. should be in fact to be desirable and it will not be worth the final goal of global domination nor desirable

---  Catholicism is not a religion of the book but rather a faith built around word and sacrament 8212 or if you prefer text and demonstration . Symbolic acts that convey the truths the Church teaches are of the essence of Catholic practice this is true of the Church8217s public life as well as of its worship The Church teaches that the just society is composed of a democratic political community a free economy and a vibrant public moral culture . Pope Benedict XVI's time in Santiago and Havana was by no means wasted but could have been used better by demonstrating in action the truths Benedict XVI taught with conviction such a demonstration would have strengthened the hand of the civilsociety associations on which the transition to a free Cuba ultimately depends . The gap between the pope's Cuban voyage is also instructive through the light it sheds on the Catholic future in a Cubaintransition and on a crucial issue in the conclave that will choose Pope Benedict 8217s successor . The pope's address in Cuba was vintage Joseph Ratzinger richly informed by Biblical and theological wisdom and lucidly expressed . The Pope deplored the importance of reason in building freedom foundation the pope depliririr iririr the foundation of freedom . The papal stressed stressed stressed on that way and that some .

---  On Tuesday Hillary Clinton responded to questions from reporters regarding the ongoing controversy over her exclusive use of personal email while she was serving as secretary of state . Clinton said that she chose not to keep her private personal emails because she thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails than two . Although the email revelation does not appear to have affected top Democratic donors8217 enthusiasm for Clinton it has prompted renewed questions about the likely presidential candidate8217s propensity for secrecy . Clinton has largely avoided addressing the emails until today . She said she requested the State Department publicize 55,000 pages of emails that she turned over . Clinton also said that people understand that their personal emails made public is an unprecedented step of asking for everyone to see all my workrelated emails public for everyone . The Clinton Foundation and Gates Foundation this week makes clear despite all this progress when it comes to the full participation of women and girls we8217re just not there yet as it remains the great unfinished business of the 21st century .

Can you explain how you decided which of the personal emails to get rid of how you got rid of them and when And how you8217ll respond to questions about you being the arbiter of what you release And secondly could you answer the questions that have been raised about foreign contributions from Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia that abuse women or permit violence against women to the family foundation and whether that disturbs you as you are rightly celebrating 20 years of leadership on this issue . Clinton: "I think that we are very clear about where we stand certainly where I stand on all of these issues" Clinton: I have absolute confidence that everything that could be in any way connected to work is now in the possession of the State Department once the State Dept. goes through them but out of abundance of caution and I have no doubt that we have done what we wanted to send that message unequivocally. That is unequivocally That is the responsibility of the individual and I want to send the message unequivocally" The private server contains communications from my husband and me
---  Rick Perry is no blowdry George Bush clone even though he owes his political career about 5050 to Bush and Osama bin Laden . In a lifetime career of ten elections since 1984 Perry has never lost one . He has an acute sense of political timing and has a huge prospective war chest for his first national foray . Perry is one of the most successful politicians in the entire history of the state . He says he never met a Republican till he was 25 and shifted to the Republican Party making straight for its conservative wing . Karl Rove took a close strategic and tactical interest in Perry8217s bid . The Bush clan ran ads for Perry but the latter's refusal to follow Bush has sowed the seeds for hostility between Perry and the Bush camp that is still flaring with Rove currently denouncing Perry . Running the world is taking care of Perry in care of the Lord or the world, says Rick Perry . The state has been hit by a record flood of floods, says Perry . Perry was up against John Sharp in the penitentiary. The state was hit by an extra five million dollars dollars miraculously miraculously came to him at the last minute two weeks before the election . The election was the largest of the century hit the Eighteenth District of the .  The presidency in an economically stable state claims that responsibility for this good fortune is theirs alone . Perry invokes low regulation and the entrepreneurial powers of the untrammeled Market for Texas8217 budgetary virtue since the great crash of 2008 . Texas has been a lowtax lowservice state for at least half a century most of that time under conservative Democratic leadership . The Legislature not the governor determines the level of spending and the elected comptroller serves as a watchdog who can refuse to approve spending that exceeds available revenue . When federal stimulus money came through Perry used it to mop up red inkamp160 in the annual budget . Texas employment wasn8217t down much at all in these years as the state lost only 53000 jobs . But looming behind that number are large losses in the private sector down 178,000 and large gains up 125000 in government jobs . The nation as a whole added 264000 government jobs 200710 meaning publicsector jobs added in Texas account for almost half of the nation8217s public sector jobs . Perry has a few skeletons in his closet some of the right think Perry is a phony conservative since he tried to force an executive order through requiring that sixthgrade girls in Texas be vaccinated with the consent of their parents withheld consent

---  Slavoj Zizek is effectively the most brilliant purveyor of Lacanian mischief and as a follower of the French 8220liberator8221 of Freud .

More striking however was that this perhaps marked the beginning of Zizeks appropriation of St Paul perhaps marked the beginning of the appropriation of . St Paul's appropriation of ‘St Paul’s appropriation of Lacanian  Zizek sets up a deconstruction of the idea of form to liberate idea of radical form 8220Lenin8221 In his essay 8220Repeating Lenin8221 1997 he convened a symposium on Lenin in Germany in part to see what the reaction would be 8212 He is interested as most firebreathing artists are in discerning the real Real amid the rubbish of systems . He is also looking for the moment when Lenin realized that politics could one day be dissolved for a technocratic and agronomic utopia 8212 8220the pure management of things8221 He compares 1914 to 1990 and in a superb bit of multitasking describes how Lenin attempted to convince longsuffering Russian soldiers to withdraw from the front and turn on the Czar He does this by drawing on multiple but singular examples of times when the Slave came face to face with the Master as in the famous case of Hitler . The audience is left effectively staring at a barenaked light bulb 8217s King Lear 1987 .

---  Robert Reich offers an explanation for why average working people in advanced nations like the U.S. have failed to gain ground and are under increasing economic stress . He says the explanation I offered a quartercentury ago for what has happened is still relevant8212indeed it has become the standard widely accepted explanation8212I8217ve come to believe it overlooks a critically important phenomenon the increasing concentration of political power in a corporate and financial elite that has been able to influence the rules by which the economy runs . Reich: America cling to the meritocratic tautology that individuals are paid what they8217re 8220worth8221 in the market without examining the legal and political institutions that define the market . It doesn't clarify why the transformation occurred so suddenly The divergence between productivity gains and the median wage began in the late 1970s and early 1980s and then took off, nor can the standard explanation account for why other advanced economies facing similar forces of globalization and technological change did not succumb to them as readily as the United States did not suddenly arrive at America8217s doorstep in those years, nor does it account for the decline in college graduates with their higher wages in line with their greater productivity, he says . The standard explanation lures the unsuspecting into thinking  Changes in the organization of the market requires examination of changes in organization of market . Changes stem from a dramatic increase in the political power of large corporations and Wall Street to change the rules of market in ways that have enhanced their profitability while reducing the share of economic gains going to the majority of Americans . This transformation amounted to a redistribution upward but not as 8220redistribution8221 is normally defined . The government undertook upward redistribution by altering rules of the game Intellectual property rights8212 have been enlarged and extended for example . This has created windfalls for pharmaceuticals high tech biotechnology and many entertainment companies which preserve their monopolies longer than ever . It has also meant high prices for average consumers including the highest pharmaceutical costs of any advanced nation . And as with intellectual property rights this market power this has simultaneously raised prices and reduced services available to average Americans Americans have the most expensive and slowest broadband of any industrialized nation for exampleamp160 . The result has been to shift the risks of economic failure onto the backs of average working people and taxpayers . Workers worried about keeping their jobs have been compelled to accept this transformation without fully understanding its political roots . The latter of these interests have been muted because the voices of working people have been muffled by big US corporations
---  The hottest topics in the current presidential campaign are the Iraq war and the 8220war8221 on 8220terrorism8221 . Kerry has adopted the Bush administration8217s campaign against 8220terror8221 and has not critically examined its premise . Any politician who speaks out against the war on terrorism and how it is a war on citizens and civil rights will risk being called a terrorist or a traitor . Kerry: Terrorism is whatever the government wants it to be It is a moving and mornping construct It can justify the closing of streets at home and the waging of war abroad It encompasses peacefully demonstrating against George Bush at home . The word 8220terrorist8221 is defined differently in hundreds of fed laws and regulations depending on their contexts . The most expansive use of the term for instance is reserved for immigrants and resident aliens 173 those having green cards and student visas for instance . Attorney Lynne Stewart has begun reading letters from her client saying the government did not say that she represented her client and saying that she should say that John Ashcroft did not answer questions about her client in court . She should spend the rest of her life in prison in prison the government arguing because she represented a terrorist appointed by the government argues because she was appointed by federal court  Three young Muslim men Northern Virginia residents and American citizens are serving 85 to 100 years in prison for supporting with their words and with one visit to a foreign training camp the Muslim cause in Kashmir . Six young men in Buffalo NY are serving 1014 years for journeying to Afghanistan on a religious trip prior to September 11 and lying about going . A young attorney in the Ashcroft Justice Department remains under investigation unemployed and unemployable because she blew the whistle on the DOJ and told a federal prosecutor and judge in Alex that the DOJ had not turned over all of its communications with FBI agents who interrogated John Walker Lindh in Afghanistan . Yaser Hamdi charged with no crime was not only deported but also STRIPPED of his US citizenshiplikely no great loss considering how he was treated by its laws . The Bush administration continues to disobey the law flaunt federal judges8217 orders including those of the Supreme Court . The govt demanded the same of Britain when it released four British men from Gitmo but the British home secretary refused to press charges . The US is on the side of India in the battle between India and Pakistan over Kashmir over Kashmir Endangering the Indian cause is terrorism But wait isn’t Pakistan our friend too Don8217t ask
---  It is hoped that capital punishment in the U.S. will collapse under the weight of its own internal contradictions in the near future . Abolitionists should heighten these contradictions and thereby hasten the institution's demise . The approach of those who argue by cases does nothing to change the conviction of our society that the existence of at least a few confessed nonreligious murderers who score reasonably well on standardized tests justify the institution of capital punishment . Even if we do not eat their remains their deaths resemble the ritual slaughter of animals more than we might like to think . Capital punishment then is not the practice of reducing the number of living murderers in the world . It is an ancient and savage spectacle that can be traced back to pagan traditions both humans and animals but cleaned up and made palatable through modern institutional procedures through legitimizing procedures through lengthy paperwork and lengthy delays and lengthy paperwork . The end of the process is a legitimizing sacrifice of both humans but the sacrifice of animals but it is finally comes it finally comes to be that when the moment the moment comes it comes to fruition. Abolitionism would accept the tone of judges and judges and governors by replying no it has not have to be replying to the somber tone of tone of the tone .  There are multiple theories of human nature of all which must be shown a pluralistic society . Only some of these theories would have it that a human being is fundamentally rotten but nonetheless nonetheless nonetheless is nonetheless capable of becoming the opposite of that . Arguments from Lack of Moral Agency 8216Absolute guilt8217 of the sort Ryan would hope to establish would be so hard to meet that effectively our society could become one without capital punishment even if that possibility remained in the law books . Iran will never be a decent society so long as it holds open the legal possibility of stoning teenage girls to death for the crime of lost chastity even if in fact it never again resorts to this punishment . This theory reaches its maximum point of strain when Death Row prisoners are given tests in order to determine whether they are held responsible for cutting off someone's head with an axe . This is an odd thing in debating whether that cognitively impaired people ought to be executed but only they ought to say having cut off an axe but only that they should be executed . Another theory of Salvation is not to invoke that we are perpetually doing dastardly or she declares that we have it save it from some of our human nature. Only some theories of Human Nature of all sorts of

Behind the cheer and camaraderie inside the small house in Watts are sorrowful memories etched as indelibly as the residents8217 tattoos . Most of the residents were victims of physical and sexual abuse some from a very young age . The prevalence of physical abuse may be the most open secret behind the open secret of the growing incarceration . Ann Cammett, dean of law school at the City of New York City University of City, has documented a history of violence in every person's lives that bears out out of their lives .

The toll is especially harsh for AfricanAmerican women though drug use and dealing occur at similar rates across racial and ethnic lines . Some abusive partners exert their control by threatening to use the legal system against the women . The quest for solutions has been challenging8212and not without pitfalls . There must be awareness of the toll that a racialized criminal justice system takes on the communities of color .

---  Restrictionist groups demanding a clampdown on legal and illegal immigration framing immigration debate in dualistic terms . US public views immigrants with more or less hostility according to the color of their skin, their Englishspeaking abilities and the degree of their religions and cultures depart from JudeoChristianity . Antiimmigrant movements are of course nothing new in the United States Campaigns against new immigrants have generally coincided with the business cycle rising in intensity with economic slowdowns declining in times of prosperity . But now restrictionist forces come to the public debate armed with a righteousness that goes beyond perceived economic threats from foreign workers . Immigration restrictionism is increasingly framed as key to homeland and cultural protection . The main message through the media is that the main message is that these voices of patriotism and patriotism are projected nationally as a combination of reason and reason and patriotism is projected as the main reason for the reason of the reason and the main voice through the flood of alarmism through the borderlands of the borderland borderlands and the media are projected as crazed vigilantes in the desertlands and crazed borderlands .

---  North Lawndale has been caught in the middle with five charter elementary schools more than any community area in need of better schools . The phenomenon of closing schools and moving toward charter schools is a national one because most of the schools being closed serve black and sometimes Latino students . Detroit activist Helen Moore says the closings of more than 300 neighborhood schools in her city over the past decade has led to even more population loss in alreadydevastated communities . The population decline that affects many schools has been worsened by the expansion of choice over the last decade . CPS officials and advocates for school choice are virtually certain to disagree with Lipman8217s assertion that the district has long neglected neighborhood schools But one thing is clear The population declines that affects . many schools have been worsened . Only 40 percent of elementary students in North Lawrdale attend their neighborhood school . In the 10 neighborhoods with the most children attending their . neighborhood school six are welltodo neighborhoods on the North Side or Latino neighborhoods . The other four are Latino neighborhoods in the Latino neighborhoods of the city . The most new charter schools have the most new ones in the city are African neighborhoods are African American neighborhoods . A third of students who don’t attend school don”t go to their neighborhood  North Lawndale is just 15 minutes from downtown and close to a major medical district so developers thought they might have a chance to lure higherincome homebuyers to the area . But these plans never materialized derailed by a combination of unscrupulous landlords and the housing crisis during the recession and the collapse of Daley8217 . The population fell from nearly 95,000 in 1970 to 47296 in the 1990 census . In 2000 a new community center and park district facility opened up In 2005 the optimism about the neighborhood was evident A plan developed through the New Communities Program a development initiative funded by the John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation put forth this bold vision . But in 2008 the Olympic dream died and the bottom fell out of the housing market . Boardedup homes both new and old are now found on nearly every street . On real estate websites most properties are foreclosures or preclosures . More than a third of those properties are currently on the market for less than 50000 are on sale for less less than five0000 according to Tracie Worthy education organizer from the Cook County Medical Examiner8217s office ruled his death was a suicide .

---  The only political topic of conversation that matters is when and how President Donald Trump will leave office . Conventional thinking has the Republican majority in Congress rising up in indignation pouring over purloined tax returns for princely emoluments from some suspect foreign power . The problem with both paths from power is that they assume an orderly transition based on precedent and succession clauses in the Constitution not an assassination worthy of Cesarian Rome or some of the slow poisons mixed into the sacraments that have been known to speed change among the popes . Palace intrigue in Washington is as American as the Bill of Rights which may explain why so many plotters come as if a wellarmed militia . One in three presidencies have ended before their time which explains how and why many of those who have risen to the highest office have done so on the back of illness assassination black ops and other instruments of the putsch . The United States only replaces its leaders after sober deliberations and presidential debates and presidential elections . In the last 238 years presidents have been swept away as if by Medici daggers . The U.S. has turned palace revolutions into a political art so that many presidictions have been sweeping away as though by Medicis daggers and black ops . The  There have been more than twenty attempts on the lives of American presidents . More likely than a physical attack is that Trump will find himself at the sharp end of a silent coup the kind of sting that the FBI and others in Washington ran against Richard Nixon . High on the list of potential conspirators would be the socalled Deep State of the intelligence agencies and corporate black holes around Washington that have a variety of grievances against Trump . The hope is that the president travels safely in the bubble of Secret Service protection that the Secret Service is happy that his weekend residences are a Florida beach club still raffling membership to anyone with twohundred grand and a New York apartment building . I could well imagine that a growing preoccupation among Trump8217s security detail is how to keep him safe from armed drones which presumably can find US officials as easily as they can the ISIS or Taliban leadership as well as the ISIS and Taliban leadership . I assume that nearly all of the Intelligence agencies around Washington there are some seventeen are some 17 are tapping the phone of the Russian ambassador why else have bugs so that the search for the NSA and the CIA are now subject to criminal investigations over leaks that revealed compromising phones calls between General Flynn and the Russians . Both NSA and CIA have bugs

Pope John Paul II is convinced that ideas and moral convictions are levers with which to move the world Ideas and values are distinctive forms of power. Culture is the most dynamic enduring factor in human affairs at least over the long haul. Culture can be resisted successfully through the resources of the human spirit through culture. Culture not politics not economics and not some combination of politicsand economics. Culture must be the most enduring enduring factor over human affairs.

Her new book A Hundred ampamp One Days grew out of this experience and is fresh honest and determinedly focused on smallscale human stories . On a recent visit to San Francisco she sat down with Mother Jones to talk about her work . She also talks about her reporting on the conflicts in Serbia Kosovo and Afghanstan and her first book The Bookseller of Kabul was an account of life in Afghanistan before during and after the removal of the Taliban . She says the more human stories you tell the more you can put the reader inside someone else's head and be insightful8221 Mother Jones: "I think many who supported the war have now turned their backs on the Americans. I think many of the people who support the war are disappointed because they see that they didn't come to liberate them they haven't really done anything to liberate the population they haven’t really do anything to protect the population" She also says she is still wondering about my translator Aliya She seemed to be wondering about a child born in the child born to be a Sunni who had never really suffered anything to a Sunni, who seemed to have suffered anything in the past. She thought he was  As a woman I think you can connect better with the women especially in a Muslim society but I think it mostly depends on being a nice person . In this war it was basically that I was more interested in the human stories . I gathered those human stories that I found most interesting by focusing on Aliya and also the two drivers Abbas and Amir who started as the best of friends but when the statue falls they cry for different reasons now they don't speak to each other . At several points in the book we find you in Ministry of Information office begging to stay in Iraq after your allotted time ten days was up . At times she was like a safe pole in my life I actually liked the fact that she was more scared than I was . In the end after seeing the torture camps she said maybe Saddam didn8217t care about us8221 And that was such a hard phrase for her to say because Saddam had always been the big hero in her life . In many many people want him back and don’t really acknowledge how he was a big hero, but now it’s papers who talk about this so that would be an opinion Aliya went around and saw it and listened to people . In a war someone has to take care of daily life
---  President Bill Clinton would have led a bipartisan plan to privatize Social Security . But in 1998 the Lewinsky scandal burst upon the President and as the months sped by and impeachment swelled from a remote specter to a looming reality Clinton's only hope was to nourish the widespread popular dislike for the hoitytoity elites . In an instant Clinton spun on the dime and became Social Security8217s mighty champion coining the slogan 8220Save Social Security First8221 The idea that 8220something must be done8221 was widespread and many expected that Clinton would follow up his capitulation to Republicans on welfare with a deal on Social Security but he didn't thanks to the zaftig young woman in a blue dress who caught his eye in 1995 . The White House working party had been established to study in detail the basis for a bipartisan policy on the Social Security that would splice individual accounts into the program . But meetings of the group were flagged under the innocent rubric 8220Special Issues8221 on the White House agenda . In the mid1990s pessimism about the future of Social Security was rife in seminars conferences opeds and learned papers by which elite consensus is fashioned . But it did tap into a vein of public anxiety and skepticism concerning Social Security finances  Clinton was desirous to be seen doing something dramatic for Social Security but not anything risky . Clinton was desperate for an approach that would prove popular that he was prepared to disappoint Wall Street 8220 Team concluded with heavy hearts that the escalating Lewinsky affair might doom all their efforts . The White House decided to follow a strategy of trying to unite the Democrats around a plan that would strengthen Social Security by transferring budget surpluses to Social Security and investing a portion in equities . Clinton also offered public subsidies to Universal Savings Accounts that would be set up outside Social Security not at its expense . The plan as a whole went down very well with the American people . Republicans were swiftly moved to insist that they too would give priority to the Social Security program . Pessimism about the future program was replaced by a growing consensus that the program must be replaced and could be saved All will and a determination that the future of the program was needed was the 173 and could not be squander the trust fund . The proposal to allow the trust to hold a range of assets not simply Treasury IOUs would also create a powerful new lever on economic policy something that Greenspan was jealously aware of something that was replaced with a determination to replace the program .

---  Bolivian President Evo Morales is the latest democraticallyelected Latin American president to be the target of a US plot to destabilize and overthrow his government . Morales expelled US Ambassador Philip Goldberg in September 2008 because he is conspiring against democracy and seeking the division of Bolivia . The US has pursued a twotrack policy similar to the strategy the United States employed to overthrow the democraticallyelected government of Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973 . Morales advocated 8220Coca Yes Cocaine No8221 and called which for an end to violent USsponsored coca eradication raids and for the right of Boliian peasants to grow coca for domestic consumption medicinal uses and even for export as an herb in tea and other products .

Then the political leaders and business organizations in Santa Cruz and other cities in Media Luna began to openly call for autonomy and secession from the central Bolivian government . The Millennium Challenge Corporation MCC had been on the brink of approving 584 million to fund the construction of a major highway linking northern Bolivia to the rest of the country as well as to make investments in agricultural projects . Yet in December 2007 the MCC stated that the current state of the USBolivian relationship is not consistent with such a working partnership . The MCC was even more blunt The project 8220was postponed because of adverse conditions including unrest surrounding the Constitution Assembly process . In August 2008 voters gave Morales a resounding twothirds of the national vote with even the Media Luna department of Pando giving him just over 50 percent However the insurgent prefects also had their mandates renewed on August 10 2008 . The insurgency movement was known as an attempt at an attempt to destabilize its economic policies to provoke a national crisis became known as a coup at an economic change policies .
---  The FBI is the business end of an ambitious antiterrorist and domestic spying apparatus that is rapidly being assembled by the federal government . The system seeks to merge the powers of domestic law enforcement including the FBI with those of the Central Intelligence Agency the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security . The CIA has won new authority to engage in domestic spying something it was long prohibited from doing . The government is working to combine information on individuals that is now scattered in countless public and private computer files into one huge database that could be used to look for patterns in people's financial or travel habits . Critics warn an erosion of privacy protections and the erosion of civil rights protections is already being felt in the streets of Chicago streets of the Chicago suburbs and the American Civil Liberties Union report in January . The Bush administration8217s measures are unraveling the web of safeguards placed on law enforcement in the 1970s after it was revealed that the CIA and the US had conducted covert covert operations against campus radicals antiwar groups and civil rights groups and anti-war groups . Critics say they stand to make surveillance of citizens 8212 once considered a temporary post-September 11 phenomenon 8220A combination of lightningfast technological innovations and the eroding of legal protections . The threat of Big Brother  Chicago police are free to amass files on organizations keep track of their members infiltrate meetings and record demonstrations . Chicago police hope to integrate their criminal and intelligence databases more closely with those of the FBI and police departments in other cities . Police around the nation from large cities to small towns are being trained in how to gather intelligence on everyday activity in their communities . The process could begin with something as innocuous as a jittery citizen reporting a man in a turban loading boxes into a car . A police officer may then visit the person fill out a 8220field interview card and pass it to the intelligence officer in his department who would send it to FBI task force . The ACLU of Illinois is especially concerned about the FBI gathering information on the political views of people who are not suspected of any wrongdoing . In the past the FBI interviewed Arab American leaders about terrorism and in the process asked their views about the invasion of Kuwait about Iraq about terrorism . After the 1991 Gulf War the FBI questioned Arab American . and in fact led to the arrests of numerous Arabs and Muslims in the immediate aftermath of 911 . in the aftermath of the . invasion of 9/11 the kind of tip that led to . the arrest of numerous Arab American. and Muslim in the wake of 911
---  Miguel Angel Trevino Morales is the last of the Zetas drug cartel8217s oldguard leaders to be captured in Mexico . He was captured in the predawn hours of Monday in Tamaulipas state . Not a single shot was fired as Mexican marines closed in on his trail . He had 2 million in cash and eight rifles with him when marines caught him outside the border city of Nuevo Laredo long the Zetsas8217 base of operations He was taken to Mexico City for questioning but unlike the days of former President Felipe Calderon there was no perp walk by a handcuffed suspect or piles of cash and guns put on display for the TV cameras . President Barack Obama praised the Mexican government and vowed to continue supporting the country's fight against drug traffickers . The US has been helping in trying to track him for some close calls by US intelligence with the combined US and Mexican marines have been helping to track the Mexican marines . US Congressman Henry Cuellar who represents Laredar who was briefed on the arrest by US officials noted that the US Drug Enforcement Administration said the US was very involved in this combined intelligence with Mexican marines and noted that it was a very successful effort to break up these transnational drug operations .  The Zetas have run their enormous turf with almost unbelievable brutality since the founders a corps of special forces defectors who went to work for drug traffickers splintered off into their own cartel in 2010 and metastasized across Mexico . Trevino Morales was captured by Mexican authorities before dawn on Monday by Mexican Marines who intercepted a pickup truck with 2 million dollars in cash in the countryside outside the border of Nuevo Laredo . Experts say the arrest is unlikely to diminish the violence in the short term but experts cautioned that taking down the group's command structure structure is likely to diminish violence in border states where it dominates through the border states . The arrest or death of top Mexican capos have led some cartels like the Beltran Leyva gang to splinter into smaller vicious warring gangs with small patches of turf others like the usual winner in these disputes the Sinaloa cartel head Joaquin Guzman who has overseen a vicious turf war with the Zeta cartel . There are some reports that Omar is also suffering from a chronic illness that would weaken his chances of taking over . There is some reports he may also be suffering from chronic illness which would weaken the chances of replacing him as a former lowranking turf boss Omar a far weaker figure .

China has long posted military and police along its border with North Korea . Despite a recent thaw in relations between North Korea and both China and the U.S. locals say that over the past six months China has stepped up military patrols here . China says it has been bolstering its defences along the border some have said as many as 300000 troops have been added to its defences . The number of Chinese military on the border could be up to 200000 or possibly 300000 . Around 31,000 of them eventually sought refuge in one of the poorest countries around the world in South Korea and others have sought to .  UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia urged the United States and its allies on Thursday to refrain from military action against Syria over a suspected chemical weapons attack and said he 8220cannot exclude war between Washington and Moscow . China is more likely to look at the issue of North Koreans rushing across its border as a military threat rather than a humanitarian disaster . UN diplomats said there was little interest among the council8217s 15 member countries to pursue the proposal . Russia called a meeting of the Security Council for Friday on Syria and has asked for UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres to publicly brief the body . The council failed on Tuesday to approve three draft resolutions on chemical weapons attacks in Syria Russia vetoed a US text while two Russiandrafted resolutions failed to get a minimum nine votes to pass .

Transcript via the White House The White House Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release May 22 2011 Remarks by the President at the .

President Obama said that the current situation in the Middle East does not allow for procrastination . The status quo is unsustainable and that a failure to try is not an option, he said . He said that there is an impatience with the peace process or the absence of one Arab leader is growing and it cannot be sustained . And I said that peace is possible for that peace to be sustained and that Arab citizens have just one or lasting peace can be sustained with one or two Arab leaders . And those are already manifesting itself in capitals around the world and that cannot already be sustained by the world, Obama said on Thursday .

---  Mike Lofgren's book The Deep State The Fall of the Constitution and the Rise of a Shadow Government appears to be a heartfelt effort to fight back against the reactionary forces that control American politics . Lofren is right to focus on the dangers of the growing national security state coordinated largely through the NSA and other agencies . He adopts the metaphor of the panopticon to describe the security state referring to Jeremy Bentham's conceptual prison design which was comprised of a circular structure with a central 8220watchman8221 tower . He laments the rise of corporate profiteering in the 8220War on Terror calling back to warnings from decades8217 past about the US military industrial complex . Financial deregulation is one of the greatest threats to our economy and the failure of both political parties to limit the power of financial elites is a tragedy of modern times . The failure of U.S. banking system has historically been a parasitic force in the American economy, the collapse of stock market bubbles has fed stock market crashes the collapse the collapse on the economy and American workers draining their retirement savings and draining the retirement savings . The NSA while not recording every phone call in the United States keeps records of these calls allowing for closer inspections of conversations on a casebycase basis  Hannity has raised no concern with an emerging deep state swamp of Trump DC lifers populated by plutocratic billionaires as the president moves to populate the federal bureaucracy with his preferred political supporters and hacks . Hannity has also seen the rise of conspiratorial rhetoric on 8220the left8221 regarding the ominous 8220deep state8221 I8217ll refrain from identifying any specific person by name fratricide is not an endearing trait but the depth of conspiracymongering has clearly afflicted various leftist critics of the American political system . While those on the left have long known that the US political system is captured by corporate power and wealth to suggest that social movement activism and opposition to the status quo are bound to fail is a horrifically misinformed position and is contradicted by history itself . Lofgren is right not to frame elected officials as slaves to faceless bureaucrats and one can see the silliness of such depictions when looking at recent history . The US is witnessing a creeping authoritarianism via the growing strength of our institutionalized militaryintelligence state I agree that this is occurring and is a serious threat to the country . But depictions of elected leaders as puppets of the bureaucracy 8211 are outlandish caricatures of how the political system really works is an insult
---  The Nuclear Energy Institute is a 100 million-a-year trade organization . Nuclear energy has been the largest single contributor to reduced air pollution in the world over the past 20 years . With China and other Asian countries planning to build more than 70 nuclear plants by 2025 years the financial stakes are staggering American companies such as GE Westinghouse and Bechtel desperately crave those multibillion dollar contracts . The nuclear industry claims that the world8217s 447 nuclear plants reduce CO2 emissions by 30 percent . But the true villain behind global warming is carbon . Existing nuclear plants save only about 5 percent of total carbon emissions hardly much of a bargain given the costs and risks associated with nuclear power . Nuclear power fails the test if investments are made to increase the efficient use of the existing energy supply . Even under the most optimistic cost projections for future nuclear electricity is found to be 25 times to 10 times more cost effective for CO2abatement in the pursuit of a nuclear response to the need to divert funds away from nuclear power would effectively exacerbate the problem of global warming . The industry is reputed to not meet universal approbation in universal nuclear power activities of the nuclear industry are oneroustation in some areas of the country . The Tennessee Valley Authority is rep  The nuclear lobby has enjoyed a long and profitable relationship with both Clinton and Gore . In the four years before Kyoto the NEI and its members doled out 13 million in political contributions to key senate and house members including John Dingell and Tom Delay . Bill Clinton signed an agreement to begin selling nuclear technology to Brazil and Argentina for the first time since 1978 when Jimmy Carter canceled a previous deal after repeated violations of safety guidelines and nonproliferation agreements . One the eve of the Kyoto meetings the nuclear industry secured another startling windfall this time a promise of nearly 400 million in research and development subsidies . The key man here was one of Al Gore8217s intellectual Svengalis John P Holdren . Holdren was tapped by Gore and Clinton to head a task force on energy and climate policy as part of the Presidential Commission on Science and Technology . He is also a longtime board member of the nukehappy Environmental Defense Fund and is now a professor of environmental policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government where he presides as the John and Teresa Heinz Professor of Environmental Policy Professor of environmental Policy at the Harvard School of Science and Policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School Of Government .

---  Fed chief Ben Bernanke has embarked on a radical and ruinous financial rescue plan . The Fed has already lent or committed 128 trillion trying to stabilize the financial system after the bursting of Wall Street8217s speculative megabubble . Now Bernanke wants to create programs that will provide up to 2 trillion of credit to financial institutions that purchase toxic assets from banks or securities backed by consumer loans . The generous terms are expected to generate a flurry of speculation which will help strengthen the banking system while leaving the taxpayer to bear the losses . Bernanke's plan has the potential to trigger hyperinflation or spark a run on the dollar . The IMF says the prolonged financial crisis has battered global activity beyond what was previously anticipated . Global activity is estimated to have fallen by the unprecedented 5 per cent in the fourth quarter led by the fourth . quarter in the U.S. and Europe which contracted by the . fourth quarter leading by the United States and Europe while it plummeted at a record 6 cent in both the United states and Europe . The global economic contraction has gripped every few few years of the first few . Credit sector has already doubled every few years than the first . years of more than doubled Credit sector of the Credit sector which has doubled in first few years  To restore the wealth lost in the current financial crisis the Treasury would have to monetize some 30 trillion of toxic assets to restore wealth . The gap of lost wealth 309 trillion is approximately the combined annual Gross Domestic Product of the US Western Europe and Japan8230amp160 Family net worth hit a record high of 6436 trillion in 2nd quarter of 2007 by 4th quarter 2008 it fell to 5148 trillion a loss of 1288 trillion . Nearly half of the world's wealth has been consumed in one gigantic capital bonfire . The government is cushioning the blow but cannot prevent nature from taking its course . The Fed has made the same bad bet that the financial institutions made and is now adding to that mistake by buying out of the safetyacy into the market It does not make a push out of buying out the safety of the market into the safety market It is not reasonable to make a reasonable attempt on Bernanke and more pressure on the dollar which does not attempt to attempt to do what is reasonable to do on the Bernanke on the banks and more than make a sensible attempt to shore up consumer spending shut down underwater institutions . All efforts have been focused on salvaging insolvent banks and restarting securitization pools of insolvent Wall Street

---  Andy Griffith who was born in Mount Airy North Carolina on June 1 1926 died on July 3 at the age of 86 in the town of Manteo . His show and his offstage role in North Carolina politics in fact help explain why North Carolina is a swing state today . Griffith was the prototype North Carolina liberal because he was a liberal . He opposed the Vietnam War In the early 1980s he publicly advocated for a freeze on nuclear weapons during the George Bush presidency . In 2008 he endorsed Barack Obama for president and supports GLBT rights . In the convergence of political and social influence only Dean Smith the UNC Chapel Hill basketball coach from 1961 to 1997 rivals Andy Griffith . In 1964 Smith joined a local pastor and a black theology student to integrate The Pines a Chapel Hill restaurant In 1966 he integrated the Tar Heels basketball team making Charlie Scott the first black scholarship athlete at UNC Smith helped a black graduate student purchase a home in an allwhite neighborhood . He supported the war in Iraq and supported the death penalty and supported GLBT . In 1988 the first majoritywhite mayor of the Southern cities to elect a black mayor Harvey Harvey Allantt . All figure into All figure figure into the South figure into a black figure into an All figure . In 2012 Harvey Harvey  The Andy Griffith Show is popular in the South today because it 8220reminds us of another kinder gentler time where common sense and a smile ruled the day . Andy was a hero while Eugene the reallife Commissioner of Public Safety for Birmingham Alabama was a villain The fictional sheriff acted with a sense of decency and humanity . The show also took a bit of the sting out of being 8220from the mountains in North Carolina . North Carolina in the 60s wasn8217t Mayberryesque despite reality the two Carolinas seemed as different as night and day in the sixties . The Tar Heel state was where four black college college students in Greensboro initiated the sitin movement the same year that Griffiths show began airing in April of that year 200 students met at Shaw University in Raleigh to form the Nonviolent Studentviolent Coordinating Committee . On the dark side, some of those in SNCC crossed the border into Rock Hill including now and six white people including now, including now-six white people who crossed into the border with now-passed Rock Hill . In the 1970s a group of seven white people were met at the bus station by a mob of twenty angry whites to pummel them back in their places .
---  Since the fall US Treasury and Federal Reserve policy makers have been flying blind sailing in uncharted waters . The power of metaphor explains in part the value of gold as distinguished from price Gold is the currency whose price is being suppressed a rapid bull run in gold means a run on credibility and order . There is a chance Congress and the White House will get it right but there is equally a chance they won8217t and given the stakes it is imperative that time and thoughtfulness take into account what a trillion dollars of fiscal stimulus without clear and adequate controls will do . The connection between the Cespedes big Republican donors and Jeb Bush is not incidental . The Jeb Bush doctrine of government is in tatters the result of the misplaced faith that commerce could do better than government in protecting free markets Gov Bush described what he believed to be the foundation for Florida8217s future in his 2003 inaugural speech . The history of political malfeasance in places like Miami rarely rises to volumes of criminal prosecutions but the bits and pieces 8211 should be scrutinized for what it says about the capacity of wealthy wellheeled lawyers lobbyists and speculators to game the system . The Florida Herald article describing the de Cespede8217 travails notes that in 19988211 the  Politicians manipulate rules so favored firms get airport deals 8230 Key findings . Virtually all major deals at MIA go to companies that give political contributions and employ lobbyists who are key fundraisers and advisors for county politicians . Developer Sergio Pino is one of the main fundraisers for MiamiDade Mayor Alex Penelas and has contributed to at least 11 of the 13 commissioners . Pino owns a waterfront home and a 54foot yacht and has a net worth of at least 19 million yet in 1995 he was cut into the airport's dutyfree shops as a disadvantaged businessman . In 1995 Pino no longer qualifies as a minority entrepreneur but he has kept his place in the dutyfree deal . The county decided he could stay in under a grandfather clause Pino said his team won because it offered the best return . In 1998 Commissioner Miriam Alonso penned an editorial bemoaning the plague of corruption scandals then afflicting the county and lashing out at 8220the venality of certain corrupt officials . The Miami International Film Festival director refused to air a documentary highly critical of Dominican Republic sugar operations owned by Miami8217s billionaire Fanjul family interests . In 2006 Pino was forced to pull in more than 32 million a year to meet airport rules requiring minority partners
---  I went for a walk around Lake Gregory this past Sunday afternoon searching for peace the freedom that comes with peace of mind . I went to the lake to find the freedom Dubya claims others want to take from me the freedom promised in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights freedom to believe as my conscience dictates freedom to accept the beliefs of others most especially those who differ with me freedom to pursue my talents and respect the right of others to pursue theirs freedom to live a healthful life to speak freely to learn and to seek just protection before the law . This president will liberate the Iraqi people even as he slaughters an estimated 500,000 innocents a liberation of questionable value one suspects. This president is president by choosing the conscience of the people of the American people at the voting booth since he is president and will decide the choice of five judges . The president elevated Iraq to the stage of the stage by claiming it had connections with terrorists that proved to be a contention that caused 911 of 9/11 of the enemy number number one proved to the contention that 911 of 911 of a contention proved a contention to the president . This one president will decide that 911 was a contention for 911 of the contention proved to prove a contention a contention of 911 a contention .  President claimed that Iraq must be taken down by force because it defied the 17 UN resolutions that called upon it to disarm and respond to human rights violations . But failed to tell the American people that America supports the state of Israel that has defied 155 UNGA and UNSC resolutions since 1948 . The claim of UN irrelevancy is specious indeed each and every contention made by this president has been shown to be demonstratively false . I have waited anxiously for a reporter to question these men and this woman about their resolve to hold Iraq to the authority of the UN resolutions Why Iraq only Why now Why not other countries Why not Israel and Palestine for example since most world leaders and the majority of the people in the nations around the world seem to find the IsraeliPalestinian crisis of greater consequence to peace in the mideast are those lies and omission now to hide the truth.

---  Last February 29 US diplomats8211backed by marines escorted Haiti8217s first democraticallyelected President Jean Bertrand Aristide to a waiting US military plane . The United Nations was obliged after the fact to endorse what amounted to a coup d8217etat and invasion A defacto government was quickly installed which consisted almost entirely of UN and other international agency employees living in exile and dedicated to neoliberal programs of structural adjustment . Yet with Iraq dominating the news most media ignore Haiti when there is coverage as when US Secretary of State Colin Powell visited in December to celebrate the US and UN 8220success8221 it is brief and distorted Yet Haiti is in far worse shape than before the coup last February . Recent international documentation of extreme human rights abuses by the USbacked defactso Haitian government should wake up the media . The US backed coup was applauded by some progressive elements in Haiti and many of the nongovernmental organizations in the US that backed them . The current government is even seen as a failed state of Haiti as an 8220failed state8221 as an alternative to a failed alternative to the previous coup or under the previous regime . Now the US military report for it has deepened even the current government in the military in November it is deepened  CARLI staff revealed that it was instructed to provide lists of alleged Lalavals human rights violators which were then read out on Haitian commercial radio . Twenty of the twentyfive commercial stations and several of the Haitian daily and weekly newspapers are owned by members of the anti-Aristide coalition . It is now feared that these lists have been used since the coup to target Lavalas leaders for summary arrest attacks on property and even death . CARLI now says no such campaign by Lavalalas existed and that the only two decapitations of police were committed by former Haitian army officers not Lavalis . Such disinformation played a major role during the previous coup as well as during the campaign to vilify Aristide . On January 14 eyewitnesses say Haitian police murdered Abdias Jean journalist for Miami radio station WKAT after he witnessed police execution of two or more young boys in such a police operation in the Port au Prince neighborhood . The CSHR investigators themselves witnessed events immediately before and after one such raid on Nov 18 in the neighborhood of Bel Air near the Presidential palace and interviewed Haitian National Police and MINUSTAH as they entered the neighborhood and interviewed some of the severely wounded victims . Credible evidence that raids had taken place almost daily since September
---  The most disturbing aspect of the current financial crisis is that no US official has correctly identified its primary cause . Presidentelect Barack Obama will either set the dollar8217s reservecurrency status on the path to extinction or risk becoming the next victim of what we call 8220the reservecurrency curse 8221 Official reserves are money held by governments and central banks for the settlement of international payments . Unlike gold official dollar reserves increase the money supply in one country without decreasing it in another . The result is inflation and deflation which can be thrown into reverse reverse reverse and reverse the process is thrown into deflation . Jacques Rueff correctly diagnosed the stockmarket boom of the 1920s and the subsequent crash and price deflation as the result of massive official accumulation 8212 and subsequent liquidation 8212 of foreignexchange reserves . Rueff also predicted the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the 1960s and predicted the collapse of the post8211World War I monetary system 8212 in the early 1930s but today today has the same potentially fatal flaw that he pointed out in two earlier goldexchange standards . Today's international monetary system is based on the paper dollar which is backed by nothing but faith in the American economy and backed by faith in American economy 8212 has the  Congress has become increasingly addicted to reservecurrency finance by a kind of fiscal version of Parkinson8217s Law . Public spending expands to absorb all available tax revenues and borrows all available means of finance . The government will borrow as much as it can from whoever will lend to it . The current crisis did not strike suddenly and unexpectedly signs of its approach were abundantly clear for years before . Despite these signs and historical precedents the Federal Reserve had neither the understanding nor the interest nor the will to stop the massive inflationary accumulation or the subsequent sale of dollar reserves abroad . This is why the Fed has been surprised repeatedly by large changes in large US monetary changes in the US monetary system . Ben Bernanke responded to Milton Friedman's thesis that the Great Depression had turned into a mild recession into a recession into mild recession . The Fed had turned the recession into an economic recession into the U.S. economy into an inflationary recession. Ben Bernankanke had turned a milder recession. The Federal Reserve has turned the Great Recession into the mildest recession into deflation. The Fed has had a mildest change in US recession. It had turned out to be a mild change in a mild economic recession. Inventors have turned the economy into a . mild recession
---  The High Constitutional Court in Egypt will rule on two pending motions that may radically change the future course of Egypt and determine the fate of its remarkable 8211 but unfinished revolution . The two motions are the constitutionality of the political ban on the former regime senior officials such as Gen Ahmad Shafiq the undeclared military8217s candidate for president . The other motions are constitutionalality of ban on former regime officials and constitutionality last winter's parliamentary elections . Each decision might drastically alter the power structure in the country and possibly propel another revolution whose fate remains unclear . But how did we get to this point of complete uncertainty history will show that the unity displayed by the Egyptian people during the eighteen revolutionary days in early 2011 was decisive in convincing the Egyptian military to dump Mubarak and side with the people . The unity of the revolution was decisive to convincing the military to dump Mubarak and dump the old regime and the people was decisive, writes Khaled El Shaikh . The US government encouraged by the US government to abandon Mubarak, writes El Shaheba . The Egyptian military has been trying to keep Egypt in the US orbit was to abandon the U.S. and the revolution, he writes. The US has been encouraging the military, he says .  Hundreds of millions of pounds spent on Shafiq's campaign to sell him as Egypt8217s savior was quietly in motion since at least last February . The MB realized before the first round of elections that their candidate would have a tough time beating the other revolutionary candidates had any of them gotten to the second round . But the mistrust among the religious and secular prorevolution groups is so deep that all attempts to unite behind Mursi have so far not succeeded . Unfortunately the net result of this division is to permit the state to engineer the deep state of the deep apparatus to engineer a deep state engineer to engineer victory . According to a wellinformed Egyptian political analyst when SCAF allowed for a free free election when allowed for the free and parliamentary parliamentary power or their allies to their allies so their allies or their political allies . SCAF was never intended to transfer any meaningful executive or governmental power to the SCAF based on their own allies or any meaningful governmental or governmental allies or to their political or governmental relations . The SCAF-based SCAF is never meant to allow for a meaningful executive power or governmental . The net result is a deep and deep-based victory when their allies and their allies are allowed for their political . The state8217-based
---  Gary Rivlin8217s new Atavist single Stray Bullet was released December 21, 2013 . The single is a single from the new single that was released on December 11, 2012 . The Atavists first met Tony Davis in the early 1990s when I was a young reporter for an Oaklandbased alternative weekly . I wanted to put a human face on the issue of teens killing teens which is how I met Tony who was two years into an 18tolife sentence for the murder of Kevin Reed8217 . Kevin Reed's brother Shannon and his friend London both 14 mistook 8220Junebug for a kid who had threatened to beat them up earlier that week . They jumped him and stole his bike for good measure . The next night Junebug and Aaron went looking for payback After spotting London and a kid they thought was Shannon8212it was Kevin8212they fetched Fat Tone who had been drinking and smoking pot all day Tony grabbed his gun and slipped into the backseat of Aaron8217’s car . Listen to this snippet from his confession that was Tony at 19 nine months after the shooting Listen to the confession That was Tony‘I ain8217t fit to kill nobody. Listen I first met tony  Tony liked to gripe but he also was a good listener I was never reluctant to share bad news with him I figured even a bad day on the outside was better than a good day in prison and I was glad to remind him that even greener pastures have ruts . Tony's world remained no wider than the five cellblocks that prison designers had arranged in a ring to create a secure gated community . By this point in his career I had switched over to writing mainly about technology and was on the move a lot thanks to changing life circumstances and the boomandbust economy . Tony had previously declared himself a Hillary Clinton supporter because he said he admired her steely toughness He was wavering now but still not ready to jump sides of sides yet yet yet to decide yet to vote for Obama or to become president . Tony thinks popular culture greatly exaggerates the extent of rape in prison . He was a convicted felon from serving time in California he was barred from voting both voting both of Obama and read both books of both Obama and Obama . He read both Obamas both books in California and read the books of Barack and read them in California as he read them both of Barack Obama and signed them from prison books in 2008. He read them
---  Last weekend's earthquake in Chile was unquestionably damaging . Haiti's development indicators are and were much worse than Chile's . Haiti ranked 149th out of 182 countries on the UN8217s Human Development Index HDI whereas Chile ranked 44th . Haiti has been the victim of numerous occupations a usurious debt that France claimed in exchange for its recognition of Haiti’s independence etc. Haiti also has a history of poverty and inequality . Chile was its first laboratory 8211 and Chile was the official economic advisor to dictator Augusto Pinochet just months after the coup . While Haiti fades from the headlines the situation on the ground in Haiti remains urgent as only a third of the survivors have their needs for a temporary dry shelter met . The UN Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti created a website that allows grassroots organizations to coordinate their efforts to be resolved the lack of coordination . There is a wiki function which means that the grassroots groups doing their work can post what they are doing as well as the large NGOs are invited to use this tool as a tool for the grassroots efforts to use the wiki function to help the aid to coordinate the efforts of grassroots groups . The funds raised 8211 though small compared to the urgent and longterm reconstruction needs 8211 are indeed generous  NGO researcher and Haiti solidarity activist would like to see immediately stop what we community organizers used to call 8220poverty pimping8221 or what could be called lately 8220disaster voyeurism8221 The seemingly innocent 8220real world8221 depictions of the actually existing poverty have real material consequences . The belief that Haiti is unfit to govern itself and is not deserving of urgently needed aid may be contributing to a backlash at the very least a drying up of private donations I hope not . The data are clear neoliberalism has failed Haiti, and there are so many NGOs that that we can't even guess at their Riddell753 at their 20033-753 . This rise in the number of NGOs is matched in their funding is an increase in the amount of funding through Globally in the Globally Regan Regangan in 1998 by the Economist Regan in Regan . The number of donations is an estimated 60000 by an estimated by Regan by about 20033 by 1998 by about 60000 . The amount of NGOs that are matched in the Global Development Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank is estimated by about 8033 by about 2033 by 20033 . The total number of donors is estimated in the United States by around 200
---  Chinese people express extraordinary levels of satisfaction with the way things are going in their country and with their nation8217s economy . The Chinese are confident that the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing will change the way their country is viewed by the public . Despite the widespread excitement about the games some in China say they are paying too much attention to the games and the percentage who expresses that opinion has increased since the Pew Research Center 8217s Pew Global Attitudes Project1 . Despite personal satisfaction levels of personal satisfaction are lower and by global standards Chinese contentment with family income and jobs is not especially high these findings represent a dramatic improvement in national contentment from earlier in the decade when the Chinese people were not nearly as positive about the course of their nation and its economy . There is also broad optimism about the performance of China's athletes among the Chinese public . Beijing residents are the least confident that Chinese athletes will outperform their opponents and that China will win the most medals at the games . China ranks number one among 24 countries on both measures in the 2008 survey by the Pew research Center8217's survey . The percentage saying that there is too much focus on the games is more prevalent than in other parts of the country is prevalent than it is in the past two years  The 2008 Pew Global Attitudes survey on how nations around the world view China its policies and its people . The survey reflects China8217s ascendance as a major power in both the developing and developed world people see China having a significant influence in their own countries In Western Europe majorities believe either that China has already replaced the US as the world's leading superpower or that it will at some point replace the US . Chinese people in most countries closely resemble the views of the Chinese people as a nation in the most countries in the survey . China's favorability rating has declined somewhat since last year in nine of 21 countries where trends are available while increasing in only two countries and remaining basically stable in 10 of the other countries . China is overwhelmingly popular among Pakistanis and Indonesians . The highest ratings come from neighboring countries including Pakistan and Indonesia . In South Africa only nine of the 23 countries surveyed express a favorable view of China but only nine Chinese people have an unfavorable opinion by the most negative assessment of the survey in three of the countries surveyed . In the three African nations surveyed only nine express a positive opinion of China in the Tanzanian survey of Tanzanians and only nine have a favorable rating of China . The Chinese people are more negative than any other
---  The war in Iraq passed a significant but little remarked anniversary this summer . The conflict that President Bush announced was effectively over on May 1 2003 has now gone on longer than the First World War . Like that great conflict almost a century ago the Iraqi war has been marked by repeated claims that progress is being made and a final breakthrough is in the offing . In 1917 the French commander General Robert Nivelle proudly announced 8220we have the formula for victory before launching the French armies on a catastrophic offensive in which they were massacred . President Bush said that in future American and allied troops would stay put in Iraq and pointed to Iran and Syria as the hidden hand sustaining the insurgency . The surge is now joining a host of discredited formulae for success and fake turning points that the US has promoted in Iraq over the last 52 months . In reality the insurgency in Iraq is conducted largely by al Qaida in Iraq was conducted by the Sunni tribes and the insurgents . In fact the insurgents are largely conducted by Al Qaida and the US government pretended that the insurgency was conducted largely in Iraq by the insurgents in west Iraq . The US administration could portray this as a fresh turning point as a new turning point of the insurgency as a turning point for success .  White House says it is too early to know if the surge is succeeding and it will wait for a security report due in September from Gen David Petraeus the top US military commander in Iraq and the US ambassador Ryan Crocker . But the new strategy was never going to turn the tide in Iraq but it puts off the moment when failure has to be admitted a potentially disastrous confession for Republicans standing for election next year . So far from preventing civil war a main justification for continued occupation it is arming sectarian killers engaged in a sectarian murder campaign that is tearing Iraq apart . A weakness of the US position in Iraq is that it has always exaggerated its own strength and underestimated that of its opponents outside Kurdistan it has no dependable allies outside Kurdistan . The occupation is unpopular among Iraqi Arabs both Shia and Sunni the occupation is politically unpopular. The surge has always exaggerate its own strengths and underestimating that of the opponents outside of its enemies. It has often sold the most quality quality American commanders in their own propaganda in its own propaganda even as ground is giving way beneath their own feet beneath their feet beneath its feet. The most positive impact was that it decided not to risk an alqtada Muqtada Sadrada Muqada decided to decide not to be the risk

---  Mimi Soltysik8217s running mate says he wants to remind people that they have power and that worker ownership of their workplaces and communities makes as much sense now as it ever has . Mimi and I agree that showing up and telling folks what they need and what we8217ll do for them is insulting and pretentious . We need Bernie Sanders to be brave enough to talk explicitly about the need for workers to own their workplaces . We are not interested in reforming capitalism we are interested in destroying it. We want people to be reminded that there really is another way to live . We can demand in very clear terms the changes we want and agitate for those changes . Ballot access has not been our main focus . We want to make the connections with the people doing the work of uplifting their communities and that is more important to us. We are focused on building and maintaining relationships between people that will endure beyond November 2016 This work will continue. We agree that there are very deeply invested in the illusion of choice and the current twoparty system operates in its own best interest . If the people truly desire change would be the smoke and smoke past the smoke of the smoke, people would be willing to look past the past .  SoltysikWalker says the American Left is fractured and bogged with sectarianism how could this be overcome going forward . He says the sectarianism of the Left in the U.S. is problematic but can definitely be addressed and worked on Essentially we are fighting for the same things Take the egos out of the equation be willing to be humble and to work cooperatively with other groups and adopt an intersectional approach so that ALL segments of the population can engage We can do this TNS How do third partiesamp160socialistamp160parties in particular break the stranglehold that the Democratic Party has over the Black community? He says they need to be more intentional about getting information about third parties into communities where folks aren't hearing about them . The fact that the Black Movement is refusing to endorse any candidate in the upcoming elections is a big factor in deciding on action or inaction in some cases and that the twoparty system has actually failed us actually has not served us well and that it has failed us well, he says . He argues that the fact that young Black activists are refusing the whole of the electoral elections is the biggest factor in the election is the reason why they refuse to endorse candidates in the elections. We need to
---  John Murphy is running an antiwar procivil liberties campaign for US Congress from the 16th District of Pennsylvania . Murphy a Green was denied his party8217s endorsement last month because as as Murphy believes he supported Ralph Nader and was critical of David Cobb in 2004 . Murphy recently spoke with JOSHUA FRANK about his campaign as well as the future of the Green Party . Murphy says he has been active in the antiwar movement ever since the 60s but the Nader campaign of 2004 gave him the opportunity to use many of the skills I have developed over the last 60 years as an educator union negotiator and business owner in support of his campaign . Murphy: "I never wanted to get involved in the internal operations of the state Green Party I thought this was better left to younger men and women I have however been active ... I have always wanted to help campaign for Green candidates at the local level My political activism took on an interesting form in the last few years I became what some people call a 8220photo essayist8221 I began by writing to my friends and business associates several years ago asking them to contact their senators to prevent an unconstitutional transference of legislative power to the executive branch whereby President Bush would be given unlimited power to wage war  The Green Party in Pennsylvania decided not to nominate me for House of Representatives in the 16th Congressional District . The reasons leading up to this decision are truly byzantine . David Cobb who actually had gotten only 12 of the Green Party votes ended up as the official candidate . Green Party chairman himself financed private contractor to collect balance of necessary signatures for David Cobb . The GDI is composed of former Nader supporters but the Greens want absolutely nothing to do with the GDI members whom they see as some kind of a radical fringe . There has even been an incredible amount of redbaiting going on but you8217re correct trying to delve into this business would take quite some time John Murphy . If the Greens in PA will survive after 2008, I find it hard to imagine how the Green party will survive in 2008 if the Greens are not ultimately successful in getting its proposals passed I don't imagine how Green Party will survive After 2008, John Murphy says. It was a cross between a high school pep rally and a meeting of a religious cult of a cult of sorts and a cross-ep pep . It was like having a beard and ponytail and a bit of a meeting as I had made me back in 1967. I had a bit back in
---  Hatred of US foreign policies intensifies day by day in much of the world but the present administration is not even examining the possibility of changing those policies to allay the hatred and reduce the likelihood of future terrorism . Bush administration is to dig in its heels militarizing the nation beyond rationality move toward preemptive warfare as a firstchoice instrument of national policy . Administration labels as 8220evil8221 a variety of nations and groups that oppose US policies . Bush and his associateshandlers have no intention whatever of considering changes in foreign policies that caused terrorism in the first place . Secretary of State Powell and his advisors seem a little more receptive to change but Powell is clearly reluctant to force a confrontation on the issue . New pressures from inside the US however could be considerably more effective . We need to start a campaign to influence voters to support new policies to change new policies, writes John Avlon. The task is not impossible. Those of us who agree that Bush8217s policies are wrong will have different emphases and will not have identical views on what changes are most important, he says. It is difficult to believe that Powell would ever allow a policy disagreement with Bush to become a confrontation . The task not impossible to drown our society over all of us  We should oppose establishment of a Department of Homeland Security . We should press for immediate congressional revisions of the USA Patriot Act to abrogate all provisions therein that the ACLU opposes . The ACLU should urge US voters to oppose the Bush administration8217s drive for global hegemony and domination . The Bush approach of 8220what we say goes8221 increases worldwide hatreds of the US and in no way benefits a majority of Americans . The pursuit of global domination by the United States by the U.S. is neither necessary nor desirable nor desirable and it will not be worth the end of the cost of money or in terms of domestic needs that be sacrificed . The true cause however and we should emphasize this is the ultimate aim of US foreign policy is not in the ultimate war we should be at war . The US has markedly accelerated its pursuit of political domination and its own version of bigcorporation economic globalization since the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago . The U.K. will not in fact be desirable and will not end in the end the end it will be the end . The United States will keep the ultimate goal of foreign policy will be worth worth in the cost in term of war or in the terms of the end and the end
---  The spreading popularity of the 911 conspiracy hypothesis is a political phenomenon of some significance . The Bush administration has shamelessly exploited 911 to instill paranoid fear in the American public in order to justify a repressive domestic policy and an aggressive war policy abroad . The choice of 911 targets contained an eloquent message that was perfectly understood in most of the world The World Trade Center stood for America8217s economic power in the world and the Pentagon its military power 1 So the attacks should be examined to see which set of aims it was designed to serve The targets and the message The al Qaeda hypothesis . The attacks were greeted rapturously in much of the ArabMuslim world They have inspired emulation. If both sides profited one of the attacks one profited opportunistically and the other actually designed the attacks to fit its purpose 1 So The September 11 attacks was greeted raptorously in the Arab Muslim world. The attacks should ... They have ... inspired emulation . The 9/11 attacks were greet rapturiously in much ... of the . Arab pilots were not the target but were as the Americans and Israelis say of their bombing runs 8220collateral damage8221 W8217’s goat story’S goat story was supposed to be part of the plot  Conspiracy theories suggest that planes were directed into the Twin Towers by US military guidance systems . The West might do well to drop obsession with bin Laden and consider what moved those men to do what they did . We are living in Manichean times 8212 our dualism matches theirs and enemies can only be 8220pure evil8221 . The layman has no way to judge between these expert explanations 8212 but neither do experts since as physicist Jean Bricmont points out scientists cannot be sure of the cause of a single event that cannot be repeated experimentarily . The real argument against the Pentagon hypothesis is that it makes no sense politically or practically Why get rid of an entire airliner full of people in order to make way for a missile to do the job attributed to the attack? The absence of jet fighter intervention is the absence of a missile was needed to do such an operation . There is no indication that the anthrax attacks are anything but the clumsy attacks were anything but attempt of some local biowarar experts are even in total opposition to the 911 attacks which were carried out by kaze warriors . The United States is not a place without a place to get into the act of 9/11 and the national attitude to keep secrets all hang out

---  A little more than a month before the Virginia Tech shootings the DC Circuit Court of Appeals issued its ruling in a landmark gun rights case Parker v District of Columbia repealing the District8217s stringent gun laws . Leading the Second Amendment challenge was Cato Institute senior fellow and constitutional lawyer Dr Robert Levy who bankrolled the threeyear effort himself . Levy says the case has been a subject of concern among gun control advocates but to the National Rifle Association as well which fears the impact of a negative Supreme Court ruling . Levy talks to Mother Jones about his Second Amendment victory his frustrations with the National NRA Association and the impact on the gun rights movement . If the Supreme Court upholds the decision it will have farreaching implications nationwide it will make state gun laws ever more vulnerable to legal challenges . The next question will be what regulations are permissible and what restrictions are not permissible and it will be the task of the legislature and the courts to ferret all the restrictions that are not permitted to be permissible and how restrictions are allowed to be prohibited . The NRA concedes that it concedes that the next question concedes that even the NRA concedes it is not a reasonable restriction under anybody can't be permitted to have an outright ban on handguns is permissible even though there are some restrictions like a prohibition .  There are all kinds of cases pending but I do not know of any case that is imminent and is similar to ours in that it is lawabiding citizens with compelling facts who simply just want to be able to defend themselves MJ Could you talk about the longstanding controversy that has existed over the interpretation of the Second Amendment? Are there similar cases pending in DC and in other states? Are you a proponent of any gun laws? I8217m support regulations on some type of weapons laws I support regulations .

As Nemo approached the local CBS affiliate proclaimed 8220For Bloomberg Getting Response to This Storm Right Would Be Redemption8221 The algebra of fallandredemption always a part of American culture seems to have become an ever more integral part of the psychological drama of American politics . Leaders are more likely to be embraced fully and heartily when they have first been shown to stumble badly to be shown to be flawed and human and vulnerable and then allowed to rise again scarred and humbled and seasoned . The requirement that politicians be flawed bears some resemblance to the equally imperative rule that presidents demonstrate something we call 8220a sense of humor8221 But also the requirement that a president demonstrate something that is equally imperative to demonstrate a strong sense of humour822 . The algebra and redemption always a key part of U.S. culture seems not to be less plausible the internal has taken on greater and greater importance as it takes on greater importance in American life as a belief in the  Mark Sanford is running for the US House of Representatives in South Carolina . Mark Sanford's bid for redemption is a bit more than the market will bear . Jimmy Carter's quest for redemption has been on the mind of expresident Jimmy Carter for the past 33 years .

---  President Bush signed an executive order establishing military commissions or tribunals to try suspected terrorists . Military commissions are akin to the US condemned in Peru in Peru which was condemned in 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center . The war on terrorism also means pervasive government and media censorship of information the silencing of dissent and widespread ethnic and religious profiling of Muslims Arabs and Asian people . The fantasy of Fortress America keeps us from examining the root causes of terrorism and the consequences of decades of American foreign policy in the Middle East Afghanistan and elsewhere . Unless some of the grievances against the U.S. are studied and addressed terrorism will continue terrorism will not be studied . We have no choice but too make our voices be heard it is time to stand and be counted on the side of justice and against the antediluvian forces that have much of our country in a stranglehold . We are not yet a police state. We need to stand against these forces. We have a choice but to make our voice be heard. We must stand and count on justice. We will not stop terrorists intent on doing us harm. We should not be trusted in the Muslim world or be trusted as what they should be trusted. They are not trusted in federal courts or in federal military commissions  Attorney General Ashcroft has eliminated the attorneyclient privilege and will wiretap privileged communications when he thinks there is 8220reasonable suspicion to believe8221 that an 8220inmate may use communications with attorneys or their agents to further facilitate act of violence or terrorism . The FBI is investigating thousands of individuals and groups and making hundreds of arrests . Congress is enacting new laws that will grant the FBI and other intelligence agencies vast new powers to wiretap and spy on people in the United States . Some of those arrested are not willing to talk to the FBI although they have been offered shorter jail sentences jobs money and new identities . They have suggested having another country do their dirty work they want to extradite the suspects to allied countries where security services threaten members and use threats to threaten them . They want to use Israeli interrogation tactics such as those employed by Israeli interrogators such as the Palestinian Territories in Israel and use them to interrogate them to make them talk . FBI has threatened to force them to jail but also threatened to arrest them for short jail sentences . They are not only facing the roundup of thousands on flimsy suspicions but also an investigation of flimsy flimsy suspicion but also threats to arrest thousands of people .

By now neither lobby has to say much or throw large sums of money around they get their way and then some through intimidation . Mainstream politicians are so used to it that they do their bidding as if out of habit so far along has this process gone that neither lobby seems able to overplay its hand . For the time being these lobbies flourish but nothing last forever and there is reason to think that both may finally have reached their apogee . The conditions for their possibility the Israel lobby8217s especially are fading fast, but there are reasons for their fading fast . In the United States has been the long pivot of the Democratic pivot to the Democratic divide, the U.S. has been about guns either except symbolically in passing or symbolically or in passing, says John Avlon . It is not even about military boosterism, says Avlon. It is about identity in the Democratic Party. It isn't about politics. It's not about politics, it's about identity, it isn't even about politics or about identity. It doesn't really really really about guns or about guns. Avlon says. It’s about identity  Rightwing jurists proffer are of little interest in their own right except as examples of specious reasoning . Israel lobby is about identity politics too but the issues are not the same in Israel itself saner Zionists warn against the socalled demographic bomb . By helping to make gun violence rampant and spectacular they have done more than their share to prepare the way for the inevitable backlash . Ironically the NRA8217s success could be its undoing as it is perceived to be too far out of line with public opinion and too militant in its opposition to an enemy that has already effectively surrendered and insofar as its role in promoting murder and mayhem is increasingly well understood its days of ruling the roost may be numbered its days are numbered . But there is no reason why the gun lobby should be able to capitalize on it indefinitely but there is not on the side of the status quo The Israel lobby or rather its Jewish component faces a demographic bomb too, writes David Frum . He says it is not that people are imbeciles or even that they are ignorant. It is that they project imbecility and ignorance to gain the recognition they seek, he writes. The operation works to the extent it does because we human beings are capable of massive selfdeception
---  In 1965 across the country at colleges at colleges students were holding antiwar teachins poetryamp160 readings and small antiwar demonstrations . Ken Burns 8220Vietnam War8221 documentary seems to emphasize the antiwar movement harassing returning veterans by name calling or spitting8212an accusation I never heard of until the mid1990s . The documentary had still another parade of facts about Vietnam but then the announcer said that the US had ordered premier premier premier Diem murdered It seemed unbelievable How could they arrange for a man to be killed Hire an assassin Pay him money? The next semester on October 15 1965 at Vietnam Day Committee8217s teachin on campus we heard that the U. was now bombing North and South Vietnam as well as increasing US soldiers fighting thereamp160amp160 I joined the first large antiwar march of 10000 to march to the Oakland Army Induction Center We marched and chanted antiwar slogans in the middle of the street down Telegraph Avenue . In August August VDC had a 3rd . Antiwar marches on November 20th when a third . VDC walked on the railroad tracks to stop the troop trains from going through Berkeley . The students organized students to walk on the . railroad tracks and stop the . troop trains through Berkeley  The antiwar movement had spread beyond small pacifist circles and college campuses to mothers senior citizens and intellectuals like poet Lowell and writers at the New York of Books who were coming out against the war . August 6th Hiroshima Day I waited for the antiwar march to begin to stop the war in Vietnam and also to commemorate the bombing of Hiroshima with the forty high school and college students at the downtown plaza in Olvera Street by the band shell . The high school kids were the most raucous pushing the line faster starting a new chant 8216Hey hey LBJ how many boys did you kill today8221 Our demonstration was a smash so that a group of us decided to name ourselves the July 9th committee and keep the group together planning more antiwar events that summer . We mostly made tshirts with antiwar slogans . We then shouted in Spanish 8220Afuera de Vietnam . The Latino men at the street corner turned to stare at us as we shouted 8220afuero de Vietnam Afuera De Vietnam8221 as we marched the downtown sidewalks through a largely Latino crowd . We proudly wore a black arm band walking up and down through the crowd on the City Hall lawn handing around a coffee can to collect money for the Peace Action Council

Roughly 125 illegal mobile home parks struggle to make 720 square feet of deteriorating metal and plywood a safe and habitable home . The names of unincorporated communities here 8212 evoke Biblical lands befitting the manmade plagues that beset the region . The valley long has been a goto toxic dumping ground particularly on tribal land particularly in tribal land . At a peak in 2009 more than 10000 shipments of dirt contaminated most of it contaminated with gasoline and other oil and other pesticides . In August the Department of Toxic Substances Control acknowledged it had failed to stop receiving hazardous waste for seven years at least seven years . The Department of Public Public Works acknowledged it failed it had at least 7 years to stop at least nine years to control at least five hazardous waste . The Valley has been the most notable have been the Lawson Dump on a TorresMartinez Desert Cahuilla Indians allotment where hellish subterranean fires smoldered tons of garbage nicknamed nicknamed nicknamed “The Devil’s pile of garbage” It was shut down  The proliferation of small unregulated parks dates back to the 1992 Farm Labor Housing Protection Act an emergency measure that allowed growers to build parks of up to 12 units without obtaining zoning and land use permits . In Coachella Riverside County has 121 unpermitted parks and a few dozen legal ones . In addition there are five major parks and more than 100 smaller ones on TorresMartinez land all outside the reach of county inspectors . Rent during the sweltering swampcooler summer can run as high as 700 a month so rent during the summer of 1998 two people died in two different parks due to energized wiring . Two years after the first crackdown, HUD announced a 21 million settlement with the county to pay for low income projects for low-income housing projects to the farm worker projects to pay community and cash payments to the low income families . In response to the first enforcement of the first settlement, the county had the first-ever housing discrimination suits against 18 parks for closure and filing lawsuits against the park owners for closure . The U.S. housing discrimination suit was filed with the US Housing Assistance Department of Urban Development and Urban Development said the first of 21 million in 2011. Two years following the first HUD announcement a settlement with a settlement to the county .
---  Last week representatives of the Bolivarian Alternative of the Americas known by its Spanish acronym ALBA met in Cochabamba to discuss the future evolution of the trade bloc designed to promote complementarity and reciprocity amongst leftleaning regimes in the region . ALBA leaders say creating the Sucre is necessary so as to defray the regional effects of the world economic crisis by substituting their trade in dollars with the new alternative currency ALBA members hope to protect themselves from future financial downturns . Ethan Kaplan a visiting Professor at Columbia University spoke to Ethan Kaplan about the economic and political implications of the new currency . Kaplan a former economic advisor to the Venezuelan National Assembly discussed the political and economic implications of Sucre . The Sucre could make ALBA nations less subject to international financial crises outside of their group but we need to remember that these countries have a lot of crises themselves . Kaplan also doubts that Sucre will protect ALBA countries from financial crises but said it would be more likely to foster economic growth and achieve better prices as opposed to protecting ALBA from the international economic downturns and said he doubts that the currency will help overthrow the dictatorship of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chvez . Kaplan has remarked that Hugo Chavez has remarked the currency would help us to overthrow the  ALBA was originally set up to counter the FTAA or Free Trade Area of the Americas the corporately 8211friendly free trade scheme sponsored by Bill Clinton and George Bush . Hugo Ch225vez on the other hand says that the adoption of the Sucre constitutes a system of 8220fair trade8221 which will distance Latin American countries from 8220hegemonic capitalism8221 and the neoliberal dictatorship of transnational companies8221 The Sucre will have four component parts the Regional Monetary Council, Sucre currency itself the Central Clearing House and a regional reserve and emergency fund How significant a break does this represent with the gogo free trading past EK I think the benefits of a shared currency are higher because you have different governments as opposed to Moscow calling the shots in terms of the ALBA countries . The benefits would be higher because of different governments and the benefits are higher than Moscow call the shots . EK says if you want to join the EU you must have a certain GDP ratio to have a debt to GDP ratio ratio to meet the requirements of a certain percentage of GDP ratio . Plus normally multinationals go to Venezuela or Ecuador and set up their own companies which get all kinds of tax breaks and make profits off exports Those profits are then repatriated to the

---  Disaster capitalism involves two kinds of assaults on communities severe budget cuts and extensive privatization imposed during periods of psychosocial shock resulting from an economic crash war or a 8220natural disaster . The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 or 8220GOZone8221 is a massive tax break for corporations and the wealthy . It has resulted in the transfer of billions of dollars from the federal government and public sector to mostly large transnational corporations and investment banks but also to the top 5 per cent of wealth holders in Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama . The GOZone has its origins in another recent disaster 911 A virtually identical package of tax breaks for corporate wealth was written into a section of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 shortly after blocks of New York City were reduced to rubble on September 11 2001 . This uberpatriotic idea was thought up right in between the two most important tax laws the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001 and Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 All three of these bills reduced corporate taxes and taxes on personal wealth to nearly record levels . In December of 2005 McCrery introduced the GOZone act to Congress and shepherded it through the House Senate and to the President's desk in a swift sixteen days with strong bipartisan support .  The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act was written by and for corporate capital . Rep McCrery8217s career was characterized by a nearly perfect record of supporting regressive taxation and budget cutting . He inherited Rep Charles Roemer's Congressional seat in 1988 after he inherited his predecessor in 1988 . The GOZone Act was designed to benefit corporations and financial institutions with stakes in Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama . Most communities were never meant to reap benefits from these tax incentives . The intended benefactors from the very beginning were large corporations the big financial companies that loan to them and the elite law firms that serve both The Gulf opportunity Zone Act has never materialized and never will New Orleans and many of the hardest hit Louisiana parishes have seen little to no benefit from the promised infusions of cash via corporate investments in their backyards . The majority who possess no vast real estate holdings and who own none of the corporate capital are at the mercy of the wealthy few to make decisions about the future Democratic control over economic development is made impossible . These policies have no positive impact for working families . The region8217S economy has shrunk especially in locales like New Orleans or coastal parishes where the GOZone8217’s promised benefits are not materialized . This has meant relatively poor levels of
---  AP has secured 58 transcripts from latest round of annual Administrative Review Boards at Guant225namo convened to assess whether detainees still pose a threat to the US or if they are still presumed to have ongoing 8220intelligence value8221 This is just the latest in a series of important actions undertaken by the AP with regard to Guant225amo . Previously the agency secured the right to reproduce 60 habeas petitions and obtained the 517 Summaries of Evidence for the Combatant Status Review Tribunals CSRTs . Also included are transcripts of the ha beas corpus petitions of 179 detainees and the Unclassified Summary of Evidence so heavily criticized by Stephen Abraham that it appears implausibly to have been compiled as a testament to the importance of Freedom of Information Act . These documents will provide lawyers with the aim of facilitating a greater understanding of the human rights activists and researchers with its than has been previously been compiled than has previously been possible possible . The documents are an invaluable base from which to gain at least an invaluable glimpse into the lives of many dozens of dozens of detainees who have never been taken part in any legal representation . The disappointment is that the documents relating to decisions made by the review boards about whether to continue to be heavily redacted or continue to hold to  The AP trailed the release of the documents with a series of press releases over the weekend picking out a few stories that contain important information . Mohammed alQahtani one of several men presumed to be the intended 822020th hijacker8221 on 911 is the first time that he has denied 911 allegations in person telling his review board that he had only admitted to them while he was being tortured . Ayman Batarfi a Yemeni doctor caught up in the failed Tora Bora campaign in November and December 2001 when the US military allowed Osama bin Laden Ayman alZawahiri and numerous other senior figures in alQaeda and the Taliban to escape across the unguarded Pakistani border . He said that he struggled to tend to the wounded and dying who were overwhelmed by American air power . He described how he had made the decision 8220 because of the decision to return home because I saw a picture of a little baby hair and her hair was not combed or combed . He insisted that he was not going to return to his goal for two months and then then decided not to return and that he wanted to help people in need of food . The AP focused on the story of other detainees whose voices had until these documents were released not been heard at all
---  Yossi Beilin is the leader of the SocialDemocratic 8220Yahad8221 party . He is one of the architects of the 1993 Oslo Accords . In his book The Path to Geneva, he describes the 2003 Geneva Accord as a blueprint for a permanent settlement of the conflict . The Accord remains unendorsed 8212 by the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority . But polls show that about 40 percent of Israelis and Palestinians in support of the agreement . In the Accord Israel makes greater territorial concessions than in previous proposals and cedes sovereignty over the Temple Mount or the Haram alSharif to the Palestinians . The Palestinian refugees for the most part give up claims of the 8220right of return8221 to Israel and receive financial compensations The Geneva Accord is unendorized 8212 . In Camp David the Ehud Barak idea was to hand over to Palestinians only 91 percent of the West Bank . The agreement was to give over to the Israelis only 91 per cent of the . West Bank in Camp David . In . the agreement there is a very clear division in East Jerusalem and in the Old City of Jerusalem we are handing over the . Old . City of . Jerusalem we would hand over the Holy Mountain to the Palestinian .  Sharon and Bush have ruled out any direct dealings with Arafat . Arafat is a very problematic counterpart and the fact that he actually rode the wave of the intifada was the biggest mistake Bush made was childish and calling him an irrelevant leader is childish too He is very relevant whether we like it or not I think what had to be done was to put conditions to him like to unify the security forces and to fight terrorism could be the way to test him again and to see how serious he was Said to him saying to him 8220Whatever you do you will never ever become again a partner8221 is actually sending him to extremism That8217s a big mistake, says YB . Bush doesn8217t live here and he doesn't have the responsibility to keep Israel Jewish and democratic but he cannot tell us don't negotiate with your only partner without suggesting a real substitute, says Sharon . Bush supports Sharon in his policy of unilateral disengagement and his security fence You oppose them Why YB I believe that getting rid of Gaza was part of his original plan but he could not do that at the beginning of his term because he suggested it in March 2001 when he was elected I would assume that he would assume this is when he is elected
---  President Bush recentlyamp160nominated Milan D Smith Jr to fill a longstanding vacancy on the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . The Ninth Circuit which covers nine western states is a notorious bastion of liberal judicial lawlessness . David L Bunning whom President Bush nominated to a federal district judgeship in 2001 had been a lawyer for only ten years . The Senate with a Democratic majority intent on blocking many of the president8217s judicial nominees expeditiously and unanimously confirmed Bunning Smith and Bunning . The greater impediment to President Bush's ability to appoint highquality practitioners of judicial restraint to the federal district and appellate courts comes from obscure Senate practices that enjoy widespread bipartisan support from senators . These practices exist because they serve the narrow interests of individual senators They are in short perquisites of membership in the club known as the U.S. Senate . The White House must return to the less glamorous work of filling vacancies on the lower courts This work is more difficult not only because of the large number of open seats but because of great influence that homestate senators believe themselves entitled to exert over lowercourt nominations . This influence can manifest itself in two ways first through the Senate Judiciary Committee 8217s blueslip policy which serves primarily as a tool of senators in the  Milan Smith says Arlen Specter's blueslip policy is what he has adopted for districtcourt and appellatecourt nominees . He says it would seem suicidal for a committee chairman to give decisive effect to that negative blue slip when it is submitted by a member of his own party . The Constitution provides that the president has the power to nominate and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate shall appoint8221 federal judges . But the practical reality has long been very different and presidents are free to engage in whatever they find expedient . Presidents are free in whatever prenomination consultation they find and I am certainly not contending that the role that senators have seized is unconstitutional as Hamilton explained in Federalist 76 . Presidents will dispense from the occasion as one more opportunity to dispense the opportunity to the . opportunity to rely on patronage supporters of supporters of the supporters of patronage of supporters to be dispense to the president . Milan Smith: Presidents are hardly immune immune to the multiplense of patronage to the fact that senators dispense of the . Bunning nomination Bunning is hardly immune from the fact the president will not be given undue weight at the prospect that personal considerations will be given at the expense of the prospect of personal considerations at undue weight . The . prospect that
---  In the 2009 general elections to the lower house of the parliament Lok Sabha the social democratic parliamentary left in India sufferedamp160 the severest electoral thrashing in a long time . This year the CPM won a total of only 16 parliamentary seats as compared to its performance in the last general elections in 2004 this is a decline of 27 seats . The CPI on the other hand won 4 seats in this time around suffering a net decline of 6 parliamentary seats from its position in 2004 . Despite having won 206 parliamentary seats the Congress merely won 2855 per cent of the votes polled in 2009 increasing it by just about 2 per centage points from 2004 . The CPM lost only marginally in terms of the share of votes polled at the national level . The social democratic left is prominent only in the three states of Kerala Tripura and West Bengal the national figures are not very relevant to assessing their electoral prospects . The increase in the vote share did not even remotely translate into changes in seats for the social democrats in the different states . The national figures hide many interesting statelevel variations hence we must also look at statelevel data to get a more complete picture of the statelevel analysis of the national election data . The bulk of the social Democratic left was concentrated in West Bengal and Kerala  The social democratic left opposed the continued adoption of neoliberal polices at the level of the central government while the same set of policies were aggressively pursued in the states where they were in power . The failure of the social democrats in the two most electorally important states of Kerala and West Bengal can therefore be read as a forceful rejection of this doublespeak and hypocrisy . Of course there were other local factors both in West Bengal and in Kerala that overlaid this broad rejection of the neoliberal turn and turned the mandate decisively against them in both these states . While it was largely responsible for creating the populist shift in the Congress party and thereby creating support in its favor it could not transform this effort into any substantial electoral advantage for itself . The Congress cashed the benefits of this populist swing electorally claiming it to be its own policies whereas in truth the social Democratic left was largely because of its doublespeak And this was largely due to its doublepeak and hypocritation for itself and this was mainly because of their doublespeak .

Calvin Mitchell Sr was held for 13 hours without being charged and held for 16 months . Sixteen months after the incident he is wary of how civilian complaints are dealt with by the department which includes 13705 officers . 6 percent of excessive force complaints were upheld in a five-year period . Citizens who mistrust the results seek out lawyers to file suits but are frustrated with the lack of results . The city resolved 935 civil cases alleging excessive force by Chicago police officers that will cost the city 612 million The Chicago Reporter researched 489 of the suits identifying 767 individual officers by their badge numbers . The Reporter found that the officers accused in the cases were provided lawyers before they responded to charges against them in writing while in nearly every case victims were questioned without lawyers . In nearly all cases victims were questioning without lawyers. Investigations often lasted more than 100 days and were closed or suspended when witnesses could not be found or witnesses couldn't be found . The Chicago Police Board a ninemember civilian body reviews and rules on the cases and meets monthly to hear public comments . City officials and aldermen have not responded  The Reporter inspected all 72 investigations of excessive force complaints involving offduty Chicago police officers from September 1999 to May 2001 . Citizens have to provide their names when they file complaints by phone or letter or by speaking with any officer . The most recent data available show that the agency receives an average of more than 900 complaints a year In 2002 the last year for which the information has been published the number of complaints hit 1447 their highest point in the past decade . The Reporter inspection found that victims were questioned in person without lawyers present while officers responded to charges in writing after lawyers had been provided . In incidents where the only people present were the alleged victim and the alleged officer and the accused officer were the only person present were . The investigation was completed in order to uphold charges upheld Several different different OPS investigations were classified as if the complaint is classified as . A number of different types of different variables to determine if the investigation was classified as “sustained” or “a number of .

---  When news came that Paul Sweezy had died we turned to ROBERT POLLIN once a student of Sweeezy8217s for input . Pollin is professor of economics at U Mass Amherst at the Political Economy Research Institute which he and his colleagues have made into a power house of research most notably into the living wage campaigns across the US most recently in New Mexico and Louisiana which Pollin pioneered . He swiftly responded with the extremely enlightening reflections below . The third major political contribution by Paul was creating his monthly Monthly Review and co-editor for 50 years in an earlier incarnation of his book Maturity and Stagnation . The return below is that Pollin will return below to return to the comment section below to share his thoughts on the comments on the contributions of the book Contours of Descent US Economic Fractures and the Landscape of Global Austerity . We are looking forward to a new book on the US economy in the Clinton and early Bush years of the Clinton, Bush and Bush years to discuss the Bush, Bush, Clinton, Clinton and Bush . We have a new version of this article. We are happy to feature a new edition of this edition of the Pollin8217’s superb book.  Monthly Review was a touchstone for the left as the 1960s burst out . The most important stream of that school of thought was its perspective on imperialism and underdevelopment It was connected to what became known as the 8220dependency school8221 The view that the third world was underdeveloped because of the system of dependency that was created by imperialism . Paul and Harry Magdoff were the first people on the left to notice this and call attention They did so with their typical cogency command of the basics and capacity to see the broader implications for a Marxist understanding of reality . I myself was heavily influenced by this work when I was a graduate student Indeed I got my idea for my dissertation after I read a Review of the Month by them called 8220Debt and the Business Cycle . The kink in the kinked demand curve refers to the capacity of oligopolists to push up prices beyond what a normal smooth demand relationship would suggest because of their pricing power. This was an important contribution in the literature on microeconomics and industrial organization and I believe Paul wrote it as a Graduate student . Paul developed an explanation for how oligopolistic firms set their prices but this theory was in all the textbooks. The kinks in the demand curve
---  The Al Qaeda attacks of September 11 prompted a flood of questions as to why the US intelligence community had failed to see them coming . Sen Bob Graham joined 36 other members of Congress to form the 2002 congressional joint inquiry into where the intelligence agencies went wrong . Graham details examples of the agencies failing to connect the dots or adapt to the new threats represented by global terrorism . He takes the Bush administration to task for disengaging from the war against Al Qaeda in order to invade Iraq a decision Graham voted against and memorably criticized on the Senate floor . He offers some recommendations for preventing future intelligence failures in his recent book Intelligence Matters . Graham: September 11 was the culmination of a long trail of American intelligence failures both at home and abroad . The U.S. needs to have a massive infusion of new people with the skills necessary to operate on threats from the Middle East and Central Asia, and reorganize the agencies in a way that will better respond to new threats we are facing today’s new threats, he says. We need to develop new ways of evaluating the patriotism and credibility of Arab Americans so that we can take advantage of people who are more likely to have knowledge of the languages and cultures that we hardly understand and come from cultures where we are even more ignorant  The commander of the war in Iraq 8212 took me into his office and said 8220We8217re no longer fighting a war in Afghanistan we were engaged in a manhunt8221 He then went on to describe how he thought the war on terrorism should be conducted staying in Afghanistan until we crushed Al Qaeda there then moving to other areas such as Somalia and Kenya where there were large numbers of Al Qaeda cells . He was suspicious of the intelligence that was coming out of Iraq and said that the Europeans knew more about weapons of mass destruction there than we did . That was my first recognition that we were about to abandon the . war on terror against the enemy that had just killed 3000 Americans in order to shift our attention to a bad evil person 8212 but a bad . person who had never killed any Americans other than in combat . The strategy of trying to train enough Iraqis and train them adequately with necessary equipment is probably the only strategy that has a chance for us to make any kind of an early 8212 exit from Iraq is probably a good strategy that can be made by training enough Iraqis to make a good 8212 and I don’t just pack our bags and walk away from Iraq . The other major international terrorist groups are Hezbollah and Hamas
---  Hartford High School is not desegregated . Only 6 percent of students who attend the school are white or Asian . Students of the Academy of Engineering ampamp Green Technologies and the Law and Government Academy are already giving serious thought to the careers they want to prepare for . Hartford students are up against the odds for a reason that may initially seem unconnected to their future professional success . There are still 55 percent of Hartford kids who are still in a position about 55 percent in unequal schools . Hartford schools are much better than they were at the time of the Sheff v O8217Neill ruling but they are still struggling to implement desegregation . The state is trying to work on through awareness campaigns to reduce chronic absenteeism and expand the number of children of color in the schools that are segregated schools that have fewer resources and attract less experienced teachers putting students of color at a disadvantage . The goal is to help bridge the racial achievement gap in schools to bridge the achievement gap for minority students but there are still some of the state's schools that don’t have the resources to meet the needs of minority students . The Hartford schools have received the same amount of funding from the state for the past five years as they say they need to do more to expand  Hartford magnet schools still generally report lower academic performance than suburban schools . But neighborhood schools8217 performance is generally worse . Fewer than 5 percent of students meet or exceed standards in math at The Academy of Engineering ampamp Green Technologies . Principal Michael Maziarz admits the school has a long way to go in raising its math and reading scores . A big focus for students is making sure that students feel a sense of ownership of the school . A willingness to adapt classroom instruction to fit students8217 needs more cultural competency training and handson workforce experience will be a recipe for success . The principals at James H Naylor School and Parkville Community School were dedicated to differentiated instruction for students who have unique educational needs whether they8217re English Language Learners they have a learning disability or they struggle with schoolwork for any reason . Teachers were learning to accept that some students should present what they know through their verbal skills while others are more likely to express what they knew through an essay . Despite efforts to make efforts to hire more teachers and struggling to prepare for major changes in student population, they still have challenges . Most of the schools are unable to afford more teachers to teach more English language learners . Most parents will complain that 31 thirdgrade students are being taught
---  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador recently robbed of the Mexican presidency by the usual fraud he was eyeball to eyeball in the great Zocalo plaza of Mexico City with Vicente Fox the outgoing president of this very polarized republic staring down his throat . At the core of their discord was who would declaim the timehonored 8220Grito8221 of Independence this past September 15 the eve of the 196th anniversary of the beginning of Mexico8217s war to free itself from the Spanish Crown . By imperial fiat the Grito is the property of the sitting president who installed on a balcony of the National Palace makes a big show of the rebel yell uttered by Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla the defrocked priest of Guanajuato who on September 16 1810 the time of day is disputed had clanged the church bells to summon the black and brown underclass of the region to rise up against the 8220 Grito . The Grito was far more appropriate to his rebel congregation than to a Fox who has often seemed more of a viceroy of a colonized land than a Fox . AMLO a student of history whose people had been occupying this Tienanmensized plaza for seven weeks AMLO let it be known  Zocalo floor stripped of tents after 49 days of civil resistance in preparation for AMLO8217s Grito and the National Democratic Convention CND to be convened the next day was filled with joyous knots of supporters many with their CND delegate badges hanging proudly around their necks . Art had flourished in the tents Poets and Ska bands and Nueva Trova singers crowded the stages and a group of 30 Jarocha musicians from Veracruz and the Huasteca strolled the sevenmile skein of the camps each night their fiddles flying . Two weddings in the camps in the last days and a christening in the Chiapas tent over which Don Samuel Ruiz the sainted bishop emeritus of San Cristobal presided . I would bet that nine months from now a lot of little 8220Andrea Manuelas8221 and 8220 Andres Manuels8221 are going to be christened too . The Mexican Night bookends the Grito it 8217s the night when Mexicans put on those floppy silly sombreros and Speedy Gonzalez serapes and speedy Gonzalez Serapes and serenade the moon . In between the strands of ranchero singers who followed one another on the big screen above the
---  Noam Chomsky has published over 100 books and thousands of articles and essays and is the leading US dissident since the Vietnam War . Chomsky gave an exclusive and wideranging interview to CJ Polychroniou for Truthout . The interview will also appear in The Sunday Eleftherotypia a major national national national Greek newspaper . Inevitable is a strong word but the appearance of ISIS and the general spread of radical jihadism is a fairly natural outgrowth of Washington wielding its sledgehammer at the fragile society of Iraq . The criminal violence of rogue states like the US and UK is not guaranteed to have catastrophic consequences but we can hardly claim to be surprised when it does US attacks against ISIS bases in Syria without the approval and collaboration of the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad would constitute a violation of international law . The most elementary lesson is that it is wise to adhere to civilized norms and international law and that the destruction of ISIS would further strengthen the Assad regime . The Syrian regime is afraid it will be next in line rather quiet rather than quiet and that it has been afraid of quiet and not for quiet . The US committed major war crimes in Iraq but the acts committed these day against civilians in the country particularly against children and people from various ethnic and religious communities  Life in Gaza has returned to normalcy after Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire . There has been a regular pattern since the first such agreement was reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in November 2005 . Each time Israel has disregarded the agreements while Hamas has lived up to them as Israel concedes until some Israeli escalation elicits a Hamas response . The Egyptian military dictatorship which is bitterly antiHamas is also adding to the tragedy . Israel might depart from its extreme rejectionism though for now the signs do not look auspicious . The latest Israeli carnage in Gaza stirred public sentiment around the world increasingly against the state of Israel .

---  In the 2018 midterms the only way to defeat Republicans and defy Donald Trump or Mike Pence will be to vote for Democrats . The idea that whatever is not Republican must be Democratic might as well be imprinted in our minds . This is why a large segment of the anti-Trump 8220resistance is for all intents and purposes a Democratic Party project . The worst thing about Democrats is their eagerness to prepare the way in public opinion for stumbling into World War III amp160 . Democrats of the Sanders Warren variety are better than that at least on domestic matters and the jury is out on the new people who are reportedly preparing to run for office as Democrats in 2018 amp160 Some of them may even have a radical bone or two in their bodies or one can at least hope amp160 The jury is still out on some of the new Democrats who are running for office . The case against lesser evil voting is sound and that it makes excellent sense logically and in most imaginable circumstances politically to oppose Republicans without supporting Democrats . Lesser evil voting elects evils worse still it promotes a race to the bottom of the race-to-the-bottom, says Don Relyea . To fight back against Trumpian one must do what the urgency could hardly be  The U.S. is a serial meddler 8211 in every country on earth that might not otherwise do what the empire8217s stewards want And yet the political class and its media flunkies are shocked shocked that Russia would be so uppity as to meddle too in American elections no less . The Clintons loved it and so did the neocons who wanted to knock Russia back down to where it was in the Bill Clinton days . But of course American meddling is and never has been confined just to parts of the world on the other side of the Iron Curtain8221 and in what used to be called the Third World . As a Cold War party Democrats are worse as they have been ever since the summer of 2016 when the Clinton campaign decided that it would be a good idea to go neocon. Since then the idea has taken on a life of its own and spilled out into wider circles at home and abroad . The idea at first was not exactly to lay the groundwork for not blaming themselves should Clinton lose to Trump or the GOP under Trump and the people around him thought that was more than a theoretical possibility . The Clinton campaign worried that only second wave feminists and Democratic Party hacks were enthusiastic about the prospect of a Hillary or Hillary and Bill Restoration
---  Marshall Auerback is a Fellow at the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute . He has some 28 years experience in the investment management business serving as a global portfolio strategist . Mr Auerbacks graduated magna cum laude in English ampamp Philosophy from Queen8217s University in 1981 and received a law degree from Corpus Christi College Oxford University in 1983 . He says he would create something close to a full employment a universal job guarantee available through the thick and thin of the business cycle . The federal government would ensure a job offer to anyone ready and willing to work at the established program compensation level including wages and a healthy benefits package . The program wage could be set at the current federal minimum wage 725 an hour to minimize wage disruption and then adjusted periodically as that is raised . The key is to get it entrenched as a permanent feature of government It would not be introducing another element of intrusive bureaucracy into our economy but simply better utilizing the existing stock of unemployed . The usual benefits would be provided including vacation and sick leave and contributions to Social Security . The main drawback would be the usual benefits included vacation and Social Security contributions to the Social Security. The main benefit would be providing . JG workers will be gaining useful work experience and training making them more appealing to  The BOE research department has no idea of how the effects interact . QE increases central bank demand for assets held in the private sector which reduces interest rates at the longer end of the yield curve . Lower rates reduce the interestincome of savers who will reduce consumption demand accordingly . But on the other hand the lower rates reduce interest rates reducing the interest income flows and reducing demand for investment funds . This uncertainty points to the problems involved in using monetary policy to stimulate or contract the economy . Marshall Auerback: We are reassembling a system that we know has basic designflaws How do we fix this Marshall Aueback? We need to try to save more of net income flows than tangibly invest out of income flows . We need a surplus of surplus or a trade trade or a surplus saving or a plan for people to make plans for the private people to save out of excess saving or trade for a surplus people . We can make this plan for surplus saving for surplus people. We can talk about this plan. We must talk about it. We need more of a plan to make a plan. I think this is not a new plan. It's not a planned plan. The best of the best of planning. We have to talk about the best
---  For Mark Bowden author of Hu233 1968 the pivotal battle of the War in Vietnam did not follow the script most Americans were used to scanning in their newspapers or visualizing on the evening news . Vietnam was after all a guerrilla war or more broadly understood a people8217s war fought to reunite a nation artificially divided into North and South by fiat of the United States in the service of geopolitical brinksmanship . The most stunning blow for Americans war managers and citizens alike was an assault on the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon taken right to the walls of the American Embassy . A thousand kilometers north at first scarcely noticed even by the Commander of US forces General William Westmoreland a battle had commenced that would become the 8220longest and bloodiest of the war not waged over the 8211 till then 8211 . The battle was one of the most intense chapters of urban warfare in the annals of American military history . The author has assembled a cast of eyewitnesses who participated in the action Vietnamese and Americans and the battle unfolds in recollections mined from their interviews and for the primary sources at his disposal such as lengthy wartime correspondences such as the author Bowden . Hu233 is written in the pageturning style of popular narrative nonfiction .  By early 1968 Hue was being little frequented by the war8217s violence and hopes were stoked that the city might avoid destruction . A degree of political complacency had set into what remained a functional commercial entrepot where trade and traffic on Hue's iconic Perfume River remained brisk . The task to create a flag to be seen not as an invasion or occupation but rather as a liberation8221 fell to Sargent Cao Van Sen an old war horse who fought with the Viet Minh against the French joined the northern Army and was then ordered back to his native Hue to organize among the Viet Cong . Sgt Sen's job was to line up the material a sewing machine and a seamstress to produce a single flag which when completed required two men to carry it . After being 8220run up the 123foot flagpole8230 that stood just outside the . royal palace before the Citadel8230 it was visible all over Hu2338217s southern wall8230 It was visible . It was seen all over the . city after being . visible all around Hu 2338217 when the city was taken over by the . VC commander who stood up to the VC commander .

---  The program first started in 1988 August 1st 1980 about a month later Martin Sheen was the mayor of Malibu or something and he wanted to import a bunch of homeless people into Malibu because of the way they were being mistreated . This was the guy that the banded together with Mitch Snyder the homeless advocate who would want to 8220advocate8221 for homelessness . He wanted to charter a bus and drive homeless people round 82em up here in Los Angeles in LA and drive them around . He said he didn't want to do this because of potential litigation of any potential litigation if any of the homeless had gotten injured I would be liable They ran in there and said there was no way of doing it but don’t actually do this You can talk about doing it. Johnny Carson did it but I mean it was worth a week of Johnny Carson’s Johnny Carson. He did it. It was worth worth a lot of money. I mean I didn”t know who’m gonna do it. I’ve got the bus and it was Johnny Carson and it made it worth $1,000,000. I want to go back to the program. It’ll be a great way to talk about it.  Tavis Smiley asked Martin Sheen about the hatred he had to endure when he was younger and trying to get into acting . Smiley followed up with another question about immigration and said that 30 of the 800,000 that Obama granted entry have engaged in some kind of criminal activity some of it misdemeanor some felony The point is they8217re not kids anymore but the American people are not gonna sit by just watch kids rounded up and sent back home So I said 8220Why don't you get something for it if you legalize this get funding for the wall Get something Get something You like Chuck and Nancy . The Art of the Deal doesn't appear that he8217s going to demand funding for a wall in either whatever he plans to do with DACA or this deal he did with the debt ceiling and some of the other items that were in that deal . The other one I8217m having a mental block Anyway they are the Estevez family is the ones that changed their named not me not me Martin Sheen said . The same kind of hatred that you see this week that you8217ve seen this week is applied against the very same people who think the same way folks are automatons . The trick for these people is to never draw distinction between legal
---  Bob Love a retired Chicago Bulls star stands chuckling on stage at Brentano Math and Science Academy in Logan Square . Brentano brought in the Teachers Academy for Mathematics and Science TAMS a local nonprofit agency . The payoff says principal Reynes Reyes has been no less impressive betterskilled teachers more enthusiastic students and substantial gains in scores on standardized math and science tests . Nationally there is growing recognition that professional development is an essential element of school improvement . A 1997 Consortium survey of teachers suggests that while they spend a great deal of time on professional development it doesn’t amount to much . Some schools seem to be sampling from a smorgasbord of programs with no coherent plan and too little time devoted to any one topic . Teachers need both coaching in the classroom and time to collaborate with their peers . A 1992 survey conducted by the independent Consortium on Chicago School Research found that a third of elementary school principals believe that half or fewer of the teachers at their own schools have a good grasp of language arts instruction which includes reading and writing instruction . Most teachers surveyed gave marks to high marks to the high marks in their high marks . Most schools surveyed by Chicago Union teachers gave to the highest marks in language arts . Teachers gave to their marks to teachers .  About half of Chicago8217s some 27000 teachers have earned raises based on additional study . This school year those lane credits will cost at least 47 million in salaries alone . Even when teachers do take courses related to classroom teaching they may not receive the necessary support at their schools to adopt new practices . Professional development choices should be tailored to priorities for raising student achievement at a particular school . Pursuing professional development as a team also can boost teachers8217 camaraderie and commitment to reaching common goals Bull believes The team approach makes it easier for teachers to help each other too With longterm planning teachers can be assured sufficient time for mastering new strategies And a focused plan keeps a school from taking on too many improvements at once . The worst schools are the ones that have 20 things going on and they can’t focus on any of them. Typically school reforms are driven by fads rather than longterm plans and schools hop from program to program in search of a quick fix for low achievement As a result teachers may grow cynical and reluctant to try new ideas as a result of new ideas . To win certification in Illinois elementary teachers are required to take only six semester hours of math and 12 of science they often choose the watereddown courses aimed at education majors

---  Tony Blair will go before the Chilcot Inquiry a panel of UK Establishment worthies charged with investigating the origins of Britain8217s role in the invasion of Iraqamp160 Next month Blair will testify before the inquiry . Blair's admission has drawn a remarkable response from another Establishment mandarin Sir Ken Macdonald who served for five years as Director of Public Prosecutions under Tony Blair . Macdonald writes that Blair engaged in an alarming subterfuge with his partner George Bush and went on to mislead and cajole the British people into a deadly war they had made perfectly clear they didn't want and on a basis that it was increasingly hard to believe even he found truly credible . Mr Blair would have found a way to drive Britain into war with Iraq even if he had known for certain that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction . The centerpiece of Blair’s case for immediate war 8211 came from unconfirmed thirdhand gossip passed along by an Iraqi taxi driver . Blairamp160 was indeed certain that . Saddam Hussein could hit Europe with WMD loaded missiles on just 45 minutes, the claim that Saddam had no such weapons when the invasion was launched when the war was launched . The smell of whitewash is definitely in the air .  The intense nearpathological selfregard in the speech was not Obama8217s alone of course we must do him the credit of acknowledging that in this regard at least he was what we so often proclaim our leaders to be the embodiment of the nation . Obama's soaring proclamation of American exceptionalism in a setting supposedly devoted to universal principles of peace was breathtaking in its chutzpah 8211 but entirely in keeping with the feelings of the vast majority of his countrymen and the ruling elite above all . But of course this is just empty verbiage a pointless baldfaced lie that not even Bush would have tried to get away with . The line was inserted in speech simply because it would sound good in the moment and create a temporary emotional reaction that might carry listeners past the macabre incongruity underlying the entire event giving a peace award to the bloodstained leader of a military machine hipdeep in the coagulate gore of two vast civilianslaughtering wars . Obama staked his boldest claim to American exceptionalist with a passage that he lifted almost verbatim from his West Point speech just a few days before when he announced his second massive escalation of the war in Afghanistan war . Obama is actually a warmaker as a peacemaker
---  The CHA has taken hundreds of lowincome residents to eviction court for violating the agency8217s onestrike policy during the past six years . The rule is part of a set of national guidelines created in 1996 to make public housing developments safer by ridding them of people who commit crime . Tenants have lost their homes over nonviolent offenses including shoplifting and marijuana possession . Some critics say that the evictions are not only too harsh but also premeditated . One in three tenants whose criminal cases were tossed out or ended with a 8220not guilty verdict had their entire household evicted or moved out without a fight the analysis shows CHA lawyer Scott Ammarell said that his agency takes an acrosstheboard approach to pursuing the eviction policy regardless of the severity of the charges . The number of evictions across the city increased sharply in CHA developments where demolition was eminent and the CHA opened 1390 onestrikes cases in 2005 to 2010 . The mayor's office declined an interview but issued a statement that said that newly elected Mayor Rahm Emanuel appears to stand by the policy . The analysis found that the number of eviction evictions have occurred in the same mixedincome communities where tenants have no chance to file a grievance or request for an internal hearing  Nearly 13000 people lived in the Near North Side public housing community which was anchored by 1230 N Burling St and seven other decaying concrete towers . Today the buildings are all gone some have been replaced by mixedincome homes apartments and condos . Many of the new residents of the area are increasingly white and collegeeducated and just 444 of the units there are for public housing . A growing number of families have faced eviction based on low-level misdemeanor charges based on a misdemeanor charge . The leading cause for arrest was misdemeanor marijuana possession . A team of 19 officers busted down Moore's four bedroom apartment door just after 8am on Sept 25 2009 when they found 48 worth of marijuana stashed on a shelf in Devonte's bedroom apartment . Moore was charged with misdemeanor pot possession within the first two days of the raid . Moore had a lovehate relationship with the police and had her notice that her lease would be terminated by the end of her lease to be terminated . The neighborhood had changed dramatically in the last 20 months that the 1230 Burling Street building was occupied by a team of officers through officers through a pat down a bag of cannabis worth a dime of marijuana in her apartment . The building was recovered from a pocket of marijuana worth a nickel of the right
---  This is the second part of an essay published in the columns of Counterpunch a year ago . In the first part I had related the story of an Afghan refugee Jamal who journeyed perilously from Afghanistan to Norway over a period of 6 years . Jamal dreams of working one day for the welfare of the children of Afghanistan He longs to see them healthy and educated No 8220compassion fatigue. Jamal assumes that the journey should be worth some American bombs also raining some day he wishes to stop making some of the bombs raining in Afghanistan . It also assumes that some of his hopes during the time allotted to him would also stop making that rain bombs also would also be raining American bombs . Jamal is surely one of the heroes in our modern world. Whether this would happen depends on how readily he will be able to make some day  Too much stands in the way of such a momentous change in human affairs but when if not in the brave new world of globalization . Global environmental crises make such a vision imperative to embrace . Technology available today makes it possible to realize the dream . How soon will the world be ready to allow an Afghan passportholder with an obviously Muslim name to travel freely and unhampered to any country of his choice? How many AbuGhraibs and Guantanamos not to speak of the secret torture chambers in countries as different and farflung as Saudi Arabia and Colombia would have to be closed down before that can happen . To solve Jamal8217s problem is to solve the problem of the modern world It is to recall the promises 173 of liberty equality and importantly fraternity 173 made at the dawn of modernity  Despite open threats from the Taliban plenty of women are standing for the elections in Afghanistan . The elections may ultimately pave the way for the unity that has been missing from Afghan history . 25 of the seats reserved for women means that after the elections there will be a higher fraction of women legislators in Afghanistan compared to the proportion in the US 15 and the UK 17 the presumptuous guardians and prosyletizers of democratic faith . There is the remarkable courage that Afghani people have shown in their struggles against multiple oppressions, especially women . There are many candles being lit in the emergence of the emergence from decades of darkness . The American dream will have to contend with more sustainable and universal visions for more sustainable visions for the future of our species for our species, ASEEMRIVY says. There is more than just irony in that
---  Mexico has affirmed an emphasis on education but in practice has negated its importance . Recently passed constitutional reforms relegate educators to temporary employment controlled by the federal government and private investors . A huge portion of federal money designed for education goes to administrative personnel and is not subject to audit . A UNESCO study reported that children from the wealthiest 25 percent of the population tested 2530 percent higher than those from the lowest 25 percent and the dropout rates were highest in impoverished southern states where 1722-year-olds averaged a mere 55 years of schooling . Mexico's federal government year after year has cut its budget for public education . In 2014 over 18,000 of Mexico8217s schools lacked electricity, 20000 did not have bathrooms and over 82000 had no drainage . Over 82,000 had . no bathrooms and . no drainage  Mexico has the highest rate of 1529yearolds who neither study nor are employed in Latin America and third highest behind Turkey and Israel in the world . The lack of meaningful employment has nurtured recruitment by criminal groups contributing to increasing discontent with social values and morality . Mexico's system of financing education begins with the federal government but is managed by individual state bureaucracies and is rife with loopholes . Education funds wind up in officeholders who enrich education department officials and flocks ofamp160aviadoresamp1608220aviators82218212 . The overall effectiveness of the education these teachers provide falls short of that achieved in other developing nations . Even married teachers whose spouses work take on second jobs in order to make ends meet . The dropout rate among qualified teachers also is very high especially among those with less than five years experience  SNTE was a powerful mover and shaker of money and politics under its general secretary Esther Elba Gordillo el SNTE . SNTE sank in national importance after new elected President Pe241a Nieto8217s government arrested her for money laundering organized crime and diverting union funds for her own extravagances . A nowin situation resulted Teachers wee maligned for their protests and not being in their classrooms and the government was accused of being disorganized and weak The conflicts further revealed the debilities of SNTE which wound up being a passive observer of the conflicts . CNTE unions in the south filed legal actions against them and tried to force their own state governments to approve alternative changes more concerned with educating and less with labor issues . In her absence SNTE shrank into obscurity a mere chattel of the federal government
---  The first round of the French presidential elections on 7 May produced a profound upheaval in the country8217s political landscape . The elections are influenced by and give further impetus to the overall rightwing lurch in Europe . Emmanuel Macron a former Socialist minister who only a year ago formed his own party En Marche which describes itself as neither left nor right . Le Pen declares herself the only candidate of radical change but in calling herself antisystem she is lying She is not an opponent but a representative of the capitalistimperialist system that over centuries brought France its major position and relative privileges including through the slave trade the brutal colonialization of Africa and other parts of the world and the continuing flow of superprofits from oppressed nations . The problem is not the problem but an 8220arrogant system but an functioning of the .  Le Pen8217s extreme enmity toward a substantial section of the population is not only in the name of fighting jihadi Islamic fundamentalists whose attacks have rightly repulsed most people whatever their religion or nonrelgious beliefs . It also heralds much more police terror especially in the banlieues which include concentrations of public housing on the outskirts of Paris and other major cities . This can only mean an almost mindboggling stepup of massive violent repression during WW2 this kind of discourse the same kind of ideology and policies led to mass roundups and concentration camps for Jewish people and others and to collaboration with the Nazi occupiers who killed many millions throughout Europe . Le Pen's social base is largely composed of those who have 8220lost out in globalisation especially much of the former industrial working class and merchants .  French presidents of both parties have legitimised what they called 8220the debate around national identity8221 Le Pen8217s party has played a very useful role for the ruling finance capitalist class as a whole and for the political class that represents them bylegitimizing ideas once considered anathema . Despite the disapproval that hangs over her head among most political opinion makers, there is a convergence of interests between Le Pen and all the socalled Republican Front . The slogan 8220Libert233 233galit233 fraternit2338221 covers up the fact that society is divided into classes with very different antagonistic interests Today it is a slogan for the disguised dictatorship of French monopoly capitalists seeking to unite the oppressed and exploited inside the country in conflict and war with rival capitalist countries for the subjugation of other peoples .
---  Kimberly Stevens kissed her three foster children goodbye on a sundrenched April morning in 2006 telling them she would see them later . She was told that a call had come into the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services hotline It alleged that her daughter had abused two foster children Sexually Shame and humiliation churned within Stevens as she started to talk with neighbors those feelings morphed to anger and then outrage She decided to take action . AfricanAmerican families in Cook County are nearly twice as likely to be subjected to sexual abuse investigations than the share of black children in the county8217s population according to a Chicago Reporter analysis of DCFS records of about 110000 child sexual abuse cases from 2005 to 2009 . The situation could worsen as the department8218s lessseasoned investigative workforce navigates an increased workload under budget cuts . In order to keep the state82  Black children were subject of more than half of 29600 calls alleging abuse in Cook County from 2005 to 2009 . Black children constituted 50 percent of the children about whom calls were made by people in law enforcement and social service workers . White youth constituted 33 percent of young people and just 27 percent of calls about black children . Police officers made the highest number of calls more than 5400 alleging abuse but the Chicago Police Department would not comment on the reasons for these numbers . The alleged abuse fell into five categories sexually transmitted diseases sexual penetration sexual exploitation sexual molestation and substantial risk of sexual injury . The hotline's use of an anonymous reporting system is another doubleedged tool in child abuse prevention and redress . It also lends itself to less detail for the investigator and to the hotline being used for other purposes like settling scores in acrimonious  After the initial report is filed DCFS has 60 days to complete a more thorough investigation according to the department8217s procedure . The number of inspectors at the child protection division has seen a 16 percent decrease from 2008 to 2010 according to a Reporter analysis of DCFS data . The system is fraught with racial class and gender bias according to Diane Redleaf executive director of the Family Defense Center an organization in Chicago that advocates justice for children in the child welfare system . For Stevens8217 family the months of separation meant her foster children had to establish new bonds in a new home and to give up the bond they had established in their home . The boy did not adjust well in the second foster home so so he was placed in a psychiatric hospital . In December 2008 the oldest child the boy still had not seen the girls had not
