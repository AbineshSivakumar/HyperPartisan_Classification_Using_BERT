We are also joined by the family members of Jaime Richardson his cousin and the first of the two officers involved in the death of Tyrone. We are happy to be able to talk to the family. We want to know why these two rogue cops were involved in this case. We need to find out why these rogue cops and why they were involved. We have to go on the streets without a death certificate.

---  Carter Page the Trump campaign8217s onetime volunteer adviser on Russia views with amazement how much a Democratic opposition research dossier has been embraced by the liberal power structure in Washington . He told The Washington Times that he is stunned because the dossier is 8220completely false8221 and 8220full of lies8221 about his supposed conduct visavis Russia last summer . Not one of the sensational allegations in the Democratfinanced memos from former British spy Christopher Steele has been verified independently at least publicly . The paper financed by Democrats via the opposition research firm Fusion GPS has been denounced as inaccurate by some former Obama administration officials . Mr Page runs investment firm Global Energy Capital LLC in New York City before that he was an investment banker for Merrill Lynch and spent three years in Moscow last decade making deals with Russian businesses . He has been doing exactly what thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton urged American entrepreneurs to do in 2012 as she stood next to thenPrime Minister Vladimir Putin in 2012 . In The Times interview Mr Page specifically rebutted all of the accusations concerning Mr Page . He said no one ever made such an offer to Mr Page or Mr Steele . Mr Steele also said he has never met Mr Sechin or Igor Divyekin a Russian official in Moscow .  Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence read portions of the Steele dossier into the record as certified facts on March 20 . Republicans are pressing the FBI for answers on what role the dossier played as the bureau made decisions to investigate and surveil Trump aides . The dossier appears to have made its way into intelligence briefings to Congress and then into news stories . Yet Mr Page watched with amazement as Democrats read parts of the dossier into record . Democrats offered no independent verification of Mr Steele's version of Mr Page's visit to Moscow with Igor Sechin and Igor Divyek . Mr Page told the Washington Times that he had never met with those two Russians and that he did not name the dossier in August . The Obama administration obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court warrant to surveil Mr Page as a foreign agent beginning in July This was about the same time the FBI obtained the dossier starting in July . Mr Steele wrote the dossier months before the Obama administration had announced the Russian government had announced that they were investigating Mr Page . The FBI had not identified the dossier as evidence to obtain a FISA court warrant for a wiretap on Mr Page in August. Mr Page said that he was not part of the Trump team’s team. The dossier appeared to be unproven
---  Tom Engelhardt: We owe Donald Trump a small bow of thanks and a genuine debt of gratitude . He says he's teaching us just how deeply disturbed our American world actually is or he wouldn8217t be where he is . Trump is a messenger from the gods the deities of empire gone astray, writes Engelhardt . He's a mess of contradictory beliefs and groups at each other's throats, he says . He is symptomatic of the nation he now leads, says Engelhardt, of the quagmire country he now represents . The United States is destined to go on killing ever more people producing ever more refugees and spreading ever more terror movements until the end of time . The U.S. is not the Romans not the British or the Romans had ever done anything in history in no way in a way in history, he writes. He says. We are destined to remain a great superpower for its remaining remaining for its own sake. It is not a great country for its future. It's not the future. We will never be able to dominate everything else in history. It will be the next great superpower. It was not the Roman Empire of the past. It has never been the Romans or its successors. It’s the Romans  Little Big Man was a man without shape and lacking all fixed ideas except about himself . His victory was in a sense a revelation that both political parties had been hollowed out as every Republican presidential candidate except him was swept unceremoniously off stage and out of contention in a hail of insults . American politics was visibly faltering and in the whirlwind a far wider range of Americans seemed in danger of going down too including Medicaid users Obamacare enrollees mealsonwheels seniors and food stamp recipients in what could become a slowmotion collapse of livable lives amid a proliferation of billionaires . Donald Trump has yet to appoint his horse or perhaps his golf cart as a senator or as far as we know commit acts of incest in the tradition of Caligula the first mad Roman emperor . Fortunately unlike every psychiatrist you haven't been examined I have no expertise in whether every psychiatrist has a diagnosis of a public figure you haven’t personally examined I’m not bound by the 8220narcistic personality disorder . I see no reason not a reason not to say the obvious reason not by the Goldwater Rule not by a public reason not for reason not reason not that he’s not bound to say ‘narcissistic personality’
---  India is in the grip of an extreme heatwave that has killed more than 1100 people in the past week . Anjali Appadurai is a member of the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice an international coalition of peoples movements around the world taking action on energy . D Raghunandan Rhagu is an expert on climate change and is trained as an Engineer Aviation and Social Scientist in India . He is also cofounder of the very recentlylaunched online political platform Tipping Point Collective. She has been organizing within and writing about international climate politics and the youth climate movement for several years. She says the majority of people of thisthe majority of this 1100 casualties of this heatwave were homeless people And the people who are affected first are people of lower incomes laborers who are expected to be working outside in the sunlight. The majority of those who are most affected by this heat wave were homeless People who are suffering from these extreme weather events were people of low-income laborers who were expected to work in the sun. The most of the casualties were those lower on the socioeconomic ladder affected first. Those affected first were low-on-the-struggling laborers who had to be expected to live in the heatwave. Those who are low on the   75 percent of the emissions in the atmosphere right now are the result of emissions from the industrialization of the West . Industrialization has gotten the socalled developed countries this is UN language the developed industrialized countries versus the developing countries the developed countries to the level of wealth and human development that theyre at right now . The world is still very much operating on a Western economic model DESVARIEUX Rhagu asks Rhagu about the Green Climate Fund and how underfunded it is . India needs to invest in which Western funding with Western funding could help with the transition to a lowcarbon economy . Rhagu says India is standing in the same queue as Burkina Faso asking for funds for funds . But there are fairly fairly large large ticket items of expenditure which India would take the lion share on a per capita basis but I think the dilemma does not stand in front of the African nations or allow the least the least African nations to allow some of the least of the developed nations or the least island states to allow it to allow for the least to stand in the front of front of line of the line or allow for some developed nations to stand on some developed countries . The most expensive proposition is a very expensive proposition which could do with Green Climate funding .

Gregory is the founder of Venezuelanalysiscom and the author of the book Changing Venezuela by Taking Power The History and Policies of the Chavez Government Verso Books He moved back to the US in 2008 because his wife was named Consul General of Venezuela in New York and he taught political science at Brooklyn College . He will soon be heading up the English website for TeleSUR which is a television network funded by Venezuela Bolivia Ecuador Argentina Nicaragua and Cuba . He has been working as a producer for The Real News since early 2016 he has been living in Quito Ecuador where he headed up the launch of teleSUR English and his wife took the position of Venezuelan Ambassador to Ecuador . He says he still tries to be as objective as possible because he has no hesitation to say the things that I think need to be said in the interests of Venezuela and the region the most and therefore I have no hesitation about what he thinks need to say about the recent events in the past year of the past month of the last year of this week . In Venezuela protests new protests are planned on Saturday The situation continues to be tense there Across the United States proopposition groups have called for  Eight Ch225vez supporters were killed in the process of those protests . inflation in the past year was 56amp160percent and crime was consistently high as well and there were more and more shortages in basic goods . Despite these problems poverty actually declined in 2013 . The United States has been accused of having their hand in this The Venezuelan government threw outwhat is it itthree consuls in the American Embassy in Caracas Kerry came out . President Obama came out and called for releasing some of the protesters that had been arrested . L243pez and Mar237a Corina Machado recognized this as an opportunity to basically organize a coup not necessarily against Maduro but actually a coup against Henrique Capriles I think one has been successful in elevating their own profile within the opposition at the expense of ruining the unity of the opposition . The students are essentially the students who actually follow the conservative or moderate student movements from private universities from the private universities in Venezuela . The Venezuelan student movement is divided between a left wing and a right wing and its certainly trying to lead the moderate student movement that is trying to follow the moderate or moderate moderate student lead of L243pererere . The student movement actually follows the liberal or moderate conservative or conservative student movement . The
---  Edward Snowden did not take all the NSA8217s classified documents with him when he headed for Hong Kong last June . Edward Snowden only downloaded a portion of the classified documents he took with him . The NSA is only one of 17 intelligence outfits in what is called the US Intelligence Community . The urge to envelop the national security state in a blanket of secrecy has proven essentially boundless as have the secret ambitions of those running that state . In the face of such boundlessness perhaps the words 8220whistleblower8221 and 8220leaker82218212 are no longer useful though we may yet have a word to describe what Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden have done we should stop calling them the creations of an overween national security State summoned by us to speak to them from its id . Imagine the unconscious societal societal societal unconsciousness in the way we can we speak to us, says TomDispatch' John Avlon . TomDispatch: "Imagine the feeling that thanks to Snowden and Snowden now we must grasp the depths of that state and Snowden are now the dark and the depths that we now grasp the depth of its secret appropriations are inconceivable without a state of its own document appropriations are in the process of documenting its own darkness and its own  The mania for secrecy has grown tremendously in the Obama years . Obama proclaimed a sunshine administration dedicated to 8220openness8221 and 8220transparency8221 That announcement drips with irony . The CIA takes 4 billion more out of the intelligence 8220 black budget than the NSA runs its own private wars and has organized its own privatized corps of spies as part of the general expansion of US intelligence and espionage abroad . In the Johnson and Nixon years we now know a staggering range of misdeeds committed in that era . Unfortunately there is no reason to believe that post-Watergate reforms of the pasts have made a thing of the nature of that era such as that 8217s. Unfortunately there8217s no reason that there is a reason to think that the reforms are a thing to believe the reforms that have been made in that way of that pasts. In the fact that postWatergate reform is no longer necessary to believe in that type of reforms that haven't been made such acts of the previous era of misreforms. In that era the accompanying technology could do so less In the current era of that8217’s ‘reforms’. In fact, there are no reasons to believe there

The question is: Are most Americans still in a country that would barely recognize a living in my parents living in a living country that has barely recognized my parents . I don't want you to think for a second that this represents some kind of elevated moral position on violence or horror it's a visceral reaction I actually wanted to see the baby monster in Alien burst out of that human stomach I just knew I couldn8217t take it In all my years of viewing and avoidance only once did I find a solution to the problem In the early 90s a . solution was to let my kids go first then take them back with me That way my . son could lean over and whisper 8220Dad in maybe 30 seconds the Velociraptor is going to leap out of the grass8221 My heart would already be pounding my eyes half shut but somehow cued that way I became a Crichten vet of the film I had been a Crchton vet of sorts .

The real power center in Washington has increasingly come to be located in the national security state and the allied corporate 8220 complexes8221 linked to it by that famed 8220 revolving door8221 somewhere in the nation8217s capital . The security state has embedded eyes and ears almost everywhere online and off here and around the world The NSA the CIA and other agencies are scooping up just about every imaginable form of human communication no matter where or in what form it takes place . Domestically the US has grown more militarized as police forces across the land heavily invested in highly militarized SWAT teams have donned more militarystyle uniforms and acquired armored cars tanks MRAPS drones and other militarystyle weaponry often surplus equipment donated by the Pentagon . There are now reportedly three to four million AR15 militarystyle assault rifles of all sorts estimated to be floating around the US there are now reports to be around the country . With all of this has gone a certain unhinged quality both for those SWAT teams that seem to have a nasty habit of breaking into homes armed to the teeth and wounding
---  Republicans have been publicly floating ways to chop social health care programs such as Medicare and Social Security under the guise that these programs account for much of the nations debt and even claim these programs will go bankrupt in the coming decades . A recently released report by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare examined the impact of raising Medicare eligibility age with and without the Affordable Care Act and the result is a huge increase in the number of uninsured persons . Dr Peter Arno is an economist and Senior Fellow and Director of Health Policy Research at the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a Senior Fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance . We talk about the difference with these costs with these as well as the difference between these costs and those of hospital emergency rooms and even the cost of providing care and not being reimbursed . We are joined by one of the studys authors Dr Arno at The Real News Network in Baltimore to discuss the impact on Medicare and the effect of raising the age of Medicare eligibility and the impact it would have on the elderly population . We also discuss the effect on the role of raising this age of eligibility for Medicare and other social security programs and the role it would impact older Americans directly because many of the .  Peter says Medicare for All is the only rational sane public policy solution to the future of health care in America . Republicans repeatedly make this claim that these programs are taking up a large chunk of our national debt socalled entitlement programs and also that they will go bankrupt the coming decades are a misnomeromer . Peter: We do have an assault on all these programs Medicare Medicaid and I believe soon Social Security as well . Peter says the Republican plan is to voucherize Medicare giving everybody a fixed amount of money to then purchase health insurance on the private market . The study that we did was focused specifically on raising the age in Medicare per se but I think its worth pointing out that even with the ACA in place the numbers the increase goes up 17fold with the Obamacare in place between what we have today and what would happen if their age is raised . Peter also questions questions about the cost of Medicare and Medicaid as well as the current cost of Social Security and the other programs as well. Peter: I really have to ask in terms of the cost the current Cost of Medicare. Peter. and Social Security at all at all Its worthwhile putting out a call out this statement that Jared Bernstein made a call for a call to call to reporters to call for policymakers to call
---  Our latest update shows corporations and stockholders still prospering under Barack Obama8217s presidency while the economy steadily adds more jobs and millions sign up for health insurance under Obamacare . But wages remain stagnant for those who have jobs and there are still 37 million who have been jobless for six months or more . US oil production is booming and dependence on oil imports is plunging but the national debt has now almost exactly doubled under this president and historically large deficits continue . This report follows our January 2014 update and previous quarterly reports dating back to our first 8220Obama 8217s Numbers8221 article in October 2012 . All figures here reflect the most recent available as of April 10 Affordable Care Act and the official enrollment period for obtaining private health insurance through the new exchanges has ended some more or less solid numbers are starting to come in . The exact total of people who have gained new coverage because of Obamacare isn8217t known but there is still no way to know that the exact number is between 58 million and 128 million and 58 million or 58 million people are expected to grow in coming months and that number is expected to rise . The unemployment rate stood at 67 percent which was 11 points lower than it was at its worst point during October 2009 and the unemployment rate  Theamp160total debt has gone up 998 percent since Obama took office rising to 126 trillion . The debt owed to the public has risen to 176 trillion an increase of 65 percent . Such large and growing federal debt could have serious negative consequences . The continuing deficits and high interest payments could slow down economic growth and even increase the risk of another economic crisis CBO said . The number of people in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program formerly known as food stamps has been declining as the economy improves and Congress enacts spending cuts . Gasoline prices have remained in check for the recent portion of Obama8217s tenure as president . Wind and solar power have more than tripled during Obama's tenure . US exports of goods and services have increased just 36 percent comparing the last three months of 2008 with the last quarter of 2013 with the final full quarter of 2008 just before Obama entered the White House . The US military has suffered a total of 155 fatalities in Afghanistan since Operation Enduring Operation Operation Freedom in Afghanistan . The Pentagon prefers to call 8220detainees 8220 Detainees and 8220Detainees, 8220 detainees. The US has suffered 155 fatalities since Operation Freedom of the Year in Afghanistan. The Pentagon preferred to call the US Freedom of Afghanistan 8220
---  Mother Jones obtained more than 450 requests for armored tactical vehicles from the Pentagon for what may be the most iconic piece of equipment in the debate over militarizing local police the mine resistant ambush protected vehicle or MRAP . In justifying their requests very few sheriffs and police chiefs cite active shooters hostage situations or terrorism as police advocates do in public . The single most common reason agencies requested a mineresistant vehicle was to combat drugs . A quarter of the 465 requests projected using the vehicles for drug enforcement and more than half indicated they were willing to deploy armored vehicles in a broad range of Special Weapons and Tactics SWAT raids . The requests flowed to a massive Pentagon program8212 known as the 1033 program that has given communities across the country a total of 56 billion in combat equipment left over from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan including a spokeswoman for the Pentagon said 625 MRAPsamp160A 2014 NPR analysis found that the Pentagon has also doled out 80000 assault rifles 200 grenade launchers and 12000 bayonets . The focus on drugs may owe partly to the fact the Pentagon originally launched the program to help local agencies fight the domestic war on drugs but the focus on the fact that the program was partly to help the domestic drug enforcement primarily for local agencies . The  Only a few dozen of the departments represented here have received an MRAP in response to their requests according to Pentagon data obtained by the New York Times and the Marshall Project . The documents Mother Jones obtained show that nearly all of these departments were placed on the Pentagon8217s national priority list of agencies in line to receive MRAPs as they return from overseas . Some of the agencies waiting in line however have a history of questionable SWAT operations Take the Kenosha County Sheriff's office which requested an armored tactical vehicle to use as part of a multijurisdictional SWAT team Two years after making its request several Kenosham County sheriffs joined the Department of Natural Resources in a SWATlike raid on a nokill animal shelter that was raising a baby deer . The DNR seized and euthanized Giggles . Some requests were simply odd In 2013 Police Chief Samuel Mackert of Dewey Beach Delaware asked for a Lenco BearCat According to a press release on Lenco's website, “It8217’s almost like driving a tank8221” In 2013 police Chief David Uhl from Dundee Michigan asked for an armored vehicle in part to secure the local Cabela 8217s a big box hunting
---  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to Congress on Tuesday . Ali Abunimah is cofounder of the awardwinning online publication the Electronic Intifada . Ali is author of One Country A Bold Proposal to End the IsraeliPalestinian Impasse . He says Netanyahu tried to present Israel as the modern rational democratic state and Iran as being a dark medieval violent ancient state He referred to the Persian bazaar as well as the Bible But of course the irony is that Netanyahu presented these Bible myths to Congress as if theyre real history . Ali says Netanyahu is appealing to the fear and hatred of Islam and Muslims that has been cultivated in the U.S. by many of the same members of Congress who are listening to Netanyahu to say its all this big morass and if we make a deal with Iran then were in effect supporting socalled militant Islam . The Beirut Star has apparently denounced that quote it is far as we can tell Hezbollah denied that Nasrallah said that . The editor of the Beirut Star apparently has not a correct translation and that the record is not a fact that he said that quote is not correct and that there is no fact that the editor of that said that he has ever said it is so far as to check into that quote that quote .  Paul says there are some fissures in the American approach to Israel that maybe we havent seen before . Paul says Netanyahu came to Congress to sabotage to sabotage the Obama administrations diplomacy with Iran It was very clear that the response from the White House was swift and harsh . The blame for that lies entirely with the American political establishment that has indulged Israel all along, Paul says . The Obama administration has sent time and again is Israel you can do whatever you want not just to the Palestinians but even undermine US plans and interests in the region and we will have your back. There will be no consequences. The money will continue The weapons will continue. The brandnew F35 fighter jets will be coming your way. So in that context why shouldnt Netanyahu behave this way? The responsibility comes back to Obama JAY And does it not also come back to the very basic approach of the United States to the Middle East? Paul says the U.S. policy assumes it must be the hegemon of the Mideast. Israel is something of an obstacle to its own imperial project in the US has decided for its own reasons that a rapprochement with Iran would be beneficial to its indususim . The US sees it effectively as a threat to its
---  Major General Charles Swannack Jr commander of the 82nd Airborne Division mentioned that corner in January 2004 . The phrase was used by Americans to describe the glide path to victory in that conflict and would long be associated with the commander of US forces General William Westmoreland . But despite President George W Bush's unforgettable May 1 2003 8220 mission accomplished mission accomplished, the American war in Iraq somehow never actually stopped . American troops found insurgents armed with rocketpropelled grenades RPGs and other weaponry sometimes even Americanproduced arms . The streets around that corner turned out to be pitted with halfburied improvised explosive devices or IEDs those same insurgents could build from instructions on the Internet and that could destroy the most wellarmored Humvee for the price of a pizza . The infamous 8220light at the end of the tunnel8221 was also occupied by a range of top US officials from President Lyndon Johnson to National Security Advisor Walt Rostow to find a dark tunnel where just the light at its end it was easy enough to imagine a train bearing down on you . For all those in the antiwar movement of that losing war those who weren't just heading for you weren’t heading for the corner were always heading for just the dark inside a dark  Is it possible that some 14 years late America8217s missionaccomplished moment is finally arriving in Iraq? Some of the good news in full view . US troops are actually being drawn down in Iraq and a mere 14 years after that missionacomplished moment some of them are evidently being sent to the place where that cornertobeturned still evidently stands . For America's warfighting generals and other key officials there have always been corners to turn beyond compare in the years leading to Washington 8217s 8220victory . Here 8220We8217ve won in Iraq8221 he said without hesitation or qualification. about that walk to the corner just not in Iraqamp160 I8217m just talking about glimmers and8230 oh wait I should mention one more thing in neighboring Syria all aglimmer itself these days the US is now seemingly on the brink of involvement in a whole new war between NATO ally Turkey and the Kurdish forces it8217t war between Turkey and Iran also seems to be lurking just around the next turn of the Trumpian corner . Here is a partial list of officials since at least 2010: US Afghan commander General Stanley McChrystal in February 2010 the US had 8220turned the corner8221
---  Maya Ludtke was an abandoned baby girl in eastern China when the one child policy and a traditional preference for boys landed her in an orphanage . Maya was part of a huge wave of Chinese adoptions 8212 some 80000 into the U.S. and 40000 elsewhere . Some 50 million Chinese girls who were given away killed in infancy aborted or abandoned or abandoned . Maya's adoption agency put Melissa in touch with an adoption agency that brought her to China and put ninemonthold Chang Yulu in her care Chang became Maya and Maya grew up as an American girl in Cambridge Massachusetts . Maya is now a 19-year-old college freshman teaming up with her adopted mom journalist journalist Melissa Ludkke to tell the story of her search for identity in China . Melissa and Maya return to the village of her birth to see what her life might have been like had she stayed in the village where she had been born . The one-child policy and attitudes toward women and girls drove a wave of some 120000 international adoptions in the United States and Maya is a Chinese fandancer and a Chinese fan of the Chinese part of the American part of her identity . Maya and Melissa are now a college freshman she8217s teaming  The stories photos and videos from that threeweek trip became the backbone of the multimedia project 8220 Touching Home in China8221 which Melissa has been developing both as an ebook and as a curriculum for schools and community colleges . Melissa says this story can be a powerful tool to help immigrants all over America into society and into higher education . Mei Fong a former Wall Street Journal correspondent in China and author of the book 8220One Child China8217s most radical experiment8221 says she can relate to the unwanted girls in China . Me Fong author of One Child Chinas Most Radical Experiment says attitudes about women and girls have been changing fast as China modernizes modernizing modernizes its modernized modernizing its rural villages . She says the positive side of this challenge is facing this challenge and challenges the challenge of gender balance in China's gender balance . The story is a challenge to the future of the one-child policy in the onechild generation of boys and young men to find wives and young women in the rural areas of the country . The stories are part of the project and the one child policy that led to some 50 million missing girls under the 30-year-old policy that has led to more girls being aborted or abandoned .
---  Vijay Prashad is the Executive Director of the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research and is also chief editor of LeftWord Books Vija He is the author of over 18 books among them The Death of a Nation and the Future of the Arab Revolution University of California Press 2016 Vijay joins us from Northampton Massachusetts . Vijay is the George and Martha Kellner Chair in South Asian History and professor of international studies at Trinity College His most recent book is The Poorer Nations A Possible History of the Global South . We take a close look at the presidents speech and what he did and did not say Wednesday morning is our guest Vijay . We also take a look to what the president mapped out of what he said about his strategy for defeating ISIS in the U.N. President Obama addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday morning . We hear the president say we need to be more forcefulforceful but also at the same time hes saying that the international community has failed to enforce international norms . We heard the president talk about no ground troops on the ground were going to be on the air strikes in Syria . We will also hear how the president said that he wants the world to join the international coalition to degrade and destroy ISIS .  UN Ambassador Samantha Power made comments about the administrations strategy of arming moderate rebel opposition . Samantha Power said that the U.S. has failed to produce a substantial armed opposition group that they would consider to be moderate . Vijay says the credibility of the strategy strikes me as not very well worked out if you look at it from the ground upwards Vijay does you think this strategy is a good one at the end of the day Vijay also says that the president is talking about ending the hypocrisy of those who accumulate wealth through the global economy and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear down the wealth . The president also talks about cutting off the funding for those that that fuels this violent ideology . The Obama administration hasnt really laid out what they mean by moderate opposition You know who are the principal partners on the ground Who is going to among the groups that are there now be recognized as moderate? Vijay. Well I mean how there is socalled private funding for al Qaeda in Iraq was an early point in the career of the Islamic State of alQaeda in the early point of its early career in Iraq and how it was at an early stage in its career of al Qaeda. The president reads The Wall Street Journal. This is how it is
---  Three gunmen barricaded themselves inside a San Diego bank in a suburb of San Diego on June 12 2012 . The police requested air support from the Pentagon and an F15 dropped two GBU38 bombs on the bank leaving the building a pile of rubble All three gunmen died . The events that followed 8212 now known to everyone thanks to 247 news coverage 8212 shocked the nation . Just over a week ago an analogous 8220incident8221 did happen in Afghanistan and it passed largely unnoticed here . American and Afghan forces surrounded a house in a village in Logar Province south of Kabul where a wedding ceremony either was or would be in progress . In late December 2001 according to reports a B52 and two B1 bombers using precision bombers wiped out 110 wedding revelers in a small Afghan village using precision weapons piloted out of 112 wedding reveliers in a . small Afghan Afghan village . The American drone has been wiping out a small number of people out of their homes sometimes in similar fashion sometimes in Pakistanis and until relatively recent numbers . For more than a decade they always always always struck . Cumulatively indicate they indicate one thing for the value of the life of the Afghan Afghan life was out of the future . For example they indicate that they indicate they are striking  The Logar bombing in Logar Province has even noted that this is not the first time part of an Afghan wedding party has been taken out by the US Air Force . Afghan President Hamid Karzai has bitterly complained about similar air strikes that kill and wound civilians in or near their homes and repeatedly demanded that they be stopped . The Afghan War has given a different meaning to the ceremonial phrase 8220till death do us part8221 The Country Crasher . In this case however however the Afghan president who lacks much real power hence his old nickname 8220the mayor of Kabul8221 seems to have the wind at his back . The Obama administration is on edge about its disintegrating relations with Pakistan thanks in part to its unwillingness to offer an apology for crossborder US air strike that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers last November . Perhaps because the list of recent US blunders and disasters in Afghanistan has grown long and painful 8212 the killing of civilians in Afghanistan is growing long, painful and painful . The list of US blundered and painful has grown to include urinating on bodies of dead enemies and the burning of Korans by one American soldier the slaughter of 16 innocent villagers by one U.S. soldier . The rise of greenonblue violence that is Afghan army
---  It was 14 years ago that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs government was overthrown by General Pervez Musharraf in a military coup . Prime Minister was arrested and later exiled to Saudi Arabia after being overthrown . Now he is back in government and is likely to negotiate with Taliban groups operating inside Pakistan to bring an end to the regular bomb attacks and violence that have plagued the country for years . The military is immensely powerful in Pakistan with vast economic interests and huge political influence . But the military is expected to be more receptive this time round tempered by his previous experiences and the military will be more tactful this time round . Nawaz has pledged to bring end to US drone strikes in Pakistan . The wheels are already rolling in the process because they wouldnt have to deal with it because they do not have to make sure that they would be the beneficiaries of this peace process because of the wheels are rolling on the right direction . Pakistanis are also likely to be under pressure from the international community and the U.S. will also need to leave Afghanistan by the end of the drone strikes . The Taliban have clearly asserted that they see democracy as antiIslam and they are not a very popular issue that not a popular issue over that issue .  Talat Hussain believes Nawaz Sharif certainly has options but whether he takes them or not is a different matter . The 63-year-old veteran politician is also one of Pakistans wealthiest industrialists . He likes grandiose projects which are eyecatching but ultimately benefit relatively few like his plans to build a bullet train service across the country and the motorway he built during his previous administration . Hussain says Nawaz will also have to fine tune quite a lot of how he conducted the foreign policy because the imperative of public pressure and delivering services to the people is too much gone are the days when you would look at foreign governments saying do this or dont do that . Hussain believes the new government will have a fierce political competition like Imran Khan now in the opposition like the new administration . The dichotomy will have to take to the economy seriously reviving reviving the economy and reviving it . Both the national economy which are very important for the present leadership of the present Pakistan is very important to be the very important national economic competition for both the present Naz and the present leader of the Muslim League League . The Muslim League is a very important part of the national leadership of Naz Sharif is very very important in the present government of Pakistan .
---  On Friday the interAmerican committee on human rights announced it was going to take up a case of a prisoner at Guantanamo . This is the first time an international body which analyzes human rights has accepted a case on a Guantanamo detainee . Djamel Ameziane a citizen from Algeria who has been detained in Guantanamo for ten years without charge or trial This is a case about right to a fair trial and the prohibition of torture And also through this case we are looking for accountability for those people responsible of committing this acts . Now joining us to talk about this is Francisco Quintana Hes deputy program director for the Andean Caribbean and Americas region for the Center for Justice and International Law . The case was presented four years ago and after extensive review of all the information that we presented last Friday this international body decided to admit the case . And now we are going to move into the second stage of these proceedings. The commission is going to review all our arguments regarding unfair trial torture and also the mistreatment that he has received and how this has affected him psychologically and also his family how his family has been crosstalked . And the United States has a legal obligation to comply with the decision of the commission. And the decision is not completely revealed and that is  Djamel Ameziane is only one of the cases that the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights has knowledge about Guantanamo . He is from Algeria and he fears repercussions if he returns to Algeria . He fears persecution because of the226128148when he first fled from Algeria in the year 2000 there was political turmoil that was also related to his religious beliefs in Algeria . Paul Paul says the decision will be a landmark that we can use to talk to other governments or talk to the United States Congress in order to do the necessary modifications through cases decided at the commission or can ask also for reparations for society . Paul says it will create an international precedent that can be used in the judicial system within the U.S. Can it be used to overturn laws and overturn laws that were created by the Argentinian Supreme Court in Peru to overturn the laws and these precedents on some cases that were litigated against some of some of the laws that dealt with some of Peruvian laws and were overturned in some cases in Peru . Paul: We just give you just an example of a couple of years ago in an Argentinian court to overturninian laws that was used in a case that was litigated by the Supreme Court to overturning some of these laws .

Up to 5000 European jihadists went to Syria to fight in Western Europe . President Barack Obama discusses unfolding events from a baseball game in Havana Cuba with ESPN allies . Leftwing racial agitator Sunny Hostin said I am so tired of seeing this senseless death I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today because we need to be forceful we cant have these muted responses to terror I thought Hillary Clinton came out with what seemed to be a very muted response . Hostin continued in crediting Trump with speaking about Islamic enclaves deemed as nogo zones in the Belgian capital . Hillary Clinton claimed to have assisted in guiding President Barack Obamas gutsy call to liquidate Osama Bin Laden . Senator Bernie Sanders called for international unity to combat ISIS in a short statement about the attacks in Belgium 8217s capital city . The city has now shut down subway transportation . The airport has been shut down and the airport has now been closed down . A third bomb was found at the airport  The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg defends his leaders honor in the face of criticism from a somewhat hawkish national security intellectual . SITE intelligence group head Rita Katz says ISIS will claim responsibility for the Islamic terrorist attacks in Brussels . The split screen now running on CNN tells you everything you need to know about Obamas foreign policy according to Goldberg . CNN reports that French authorities need about 25 agents per Islamic terrorist for the purposes of monitoring and surveillance . Former DHS head Michael Chertoff claimed that lack of assimilation of Muslims was a driving force behind Islamic terrorism . The idea that you can identify people who are at risk for becoming Islamic terrorists based upon their religion or the way they look is completely fallacious . Karl Rove asserts that American authorities are effective at screening persons who enter the country lawfully He then claims that the Islamic attacks in NATO are evidence of the essentialness of NATO . The Islamic terrorist attack in Brussels is proof that the attacks in Belgium are proof that NATO is capable of preventing Islamic terrorists returning to France after assisting Jihadist movements like ISIS . The Huffington Post says that this amounts to thousands of agents across Europe for this purpose knowing that thousands of Islamic terrorists return to France for this reason . CNN's Peter Bergen a terrorism analyst with leftwing CNN says that

---  It was 14 years ago that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs government was overthrown by General Pervez Musharraf in a military coup . Prime Minister was arrested and later exiled to Saudi Arabia after being overthrown . Now he is back in government and is likely to negotiate with Taliban groups operating inside Pakistan to bring an end to the regular bomb attacks and violence that have plagued the country for years . The military is immensely powerful in Pakistan with vast economic interests and huge political influence . But the military is expected to be more receptive this time round tempered by his previous experiences and the military will be more tactful this time round . Nawaz has pledged to bring end to US drone strikes in Pakistan . The wheels are already rolling in the process because they wouldnt have to deal with it because they do not have to make sure that they would be the beneficiaries of this peace process because of the wheels are rolling on the right direction . Pakistanis are also likely to be under pressure from the international community and the U.S. will also need to leave Afghanistan by the end of the drone strikes . The Taliban have clearly asserted that they see democracy as antiIslam and they are not a very popular issue that not a popular issue over that issue .  Talat Hussain believes Nawaz Sharif certainly has options but whether he takes them or not is a different matter . The 63-year-old veteran politician is also one of Pakistans wealthiest industrialists . He likes grandiose projects which are eyecatching but ultimately benefit relatively few like his plans to build a bullet train service across the country and the motorway he built during his previous administration . Hussain says Nawaz will also have to fine tune quite a lot of how he conducted the foreign policy because the imperative of public pressure and delivering services to the people is too much gone are the days when you would look at foreign governments saying do this or dont do that . Hussain believes the new government will have a fierce political competition like Imran Khan now in the opposition like the new administration . The dichotomy will have to take to the economy seriously reviving reviving the economy and reviving it . Both the national economy which are very important for the present leadership of the present Pakistan is very important to be the very important national economic competition for both the present Naz and the present leader of the Muslim League League . The Muslim League is a very important part of the national leadership of Naz Sharif is very very important in the present government of Pakistan .
---  For almost 50 years the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have been in one level of warfare or another with the government of Colombia . Now there is again talk of a peace process in Colombia . Forrest Hylton Forrest is an associate professor of history at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogot195161 . He was recently awarded a postdoctorial fellowship at New York University . Forrest is the author of several books including Evil Hour in Colombia Vanishing Acts A Tragedy and coauthor of Revolutionary Horizons Past and Present in Bolivian Politics . He says the FARC at the highest levels is in favor of advancing some kind of peace negotiations with the current government Its not clear how far the process is going to get before an election although if Santos were able to make any kind of progress towards peace before the elections in 2014 that would certainly guarantee his reelection . The FARC has made it clear at least in his public statements that he thinks the time has come to begin negotiating, but he has made a decision on how much political capital he would be willing to risk it if he wants to risk risk of risking his political capital to make a deal with the peace process before the election in 2014 . For more information please contact The Real News Network on iReport.  The FARC was linked at the hip with the Colombian Communist Party for a very very long time which is to say for most of its existence . They were considered for better or for worse to be a component of the Colombian left in the decades when such a thing existed . But theres really almost nothing of a Colombian left to speak of and the FARC certainly are not part of it In fact they are one of the reasons why the nonarmed left is so weak in Colombia because the paramilitary right is armed to the teeth and linked to military intelligence as well as other instances of the military and police . Santos is however quite different than Uribe in terms of being willing to negotiate with the guerrilla guerrilla guerrilla guerrillas under certain conditions as it was very difficult to imagine under conditions under which conditions under . Uribe would have negotiated other than surrender JAY . Santos broke with the US on the issue of Cuba at the Summit Meeting of the Americas Meeting of Latin America at the U.S. of that left and also stayed in solidarity with the rest of the . of that . of Cuba . of the United States at the summit of the Summit of . the . Americas Meeting Meeting of Americas . of Americas meeting with the United Nations of the South America .
---  Former State Dept. diplomat spent 12 months in Iraq in 20092010 as part of the American occupation . Iraq had already been tacitly divided into feuding statelets controlled by Sunnis Shias and Kurds . Baghdad government had turned into a typical thirdworld thirdworld democracy fueled by American money but with a particularly nasty twist they were dedicated to persecuting marginalizing marginalizing the minority minority group group . Iraq's Shia government in Baghdad was hellbent on ensuring that there would be no Sunni in its Iraq . The staggering costs of all this8217 was 32 billion to train the Iraqi Army for the reconstruction for 32 billion more than 32 billion dollars . The overall war for reconstruction was almost 4500 Americans ampn8217 for the overall war and more than 4,500 Americans dead and more more than 2,500 for the total dead Americans . The Grandsons of Evil in the Axis of Evil, the most powerful foreign power in the world had been built in the moment of imperial hubris of the empire of Imperial hubris and the most influential foreign power was the Iran-backed regime of Saddam Hussein . The US government had once been determined to take down alongside Saddam Hussein as one of the Bush administration had once be determined to topple Saddam Hussein and the  The truth on the ground these days is tragically familiar an Iraq even more divided into feuding statelets a Baghdad government kleptocracy about to be reinvigorated by freeflowing American money . Brett McGurk who served in key Iraq policy positions throughout the Bush and Obama administrations is again the point man as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iraq and Iran . Obama hardly can be blamed for all of this but he8217s done his part to make it worse and worse it will surely get as his administration once again assumes ownership of the SunniShia fight The 8220new8221 unity plan that will fail follows the pattern of the one that did fail in 2007 use American military force to create a political space for 8220reconciliation8221 between onceburned Sunnis and a compromise Shia government that American money tries to nudge into an agreement against Iran 8217s wishes . The State Department still stays hidden behind the walls of that billiondollar embassy, the U.S. is still hidden behind that billion dollar embassy and the mercenary security contractors are all familiar names mostly leftovers from the glory days of the 2003 invasion of 2003 invasion . The Iranians have the same military commander on the Iraq War . The Iranian forces are already there
---  When men first made war in the air the imagery that accompanied them was of knights jousting in the sky . These days we need a new set of terms to explain what US air power actually does . American 8220air superiority8221 in any war the US now fights is total In fact the last time American jets met enemy planes of any sort in any skies was in the First Gulf War in 1991 and since Saddam Hussein's once powerful air force didn't offer much opposition . The last time US pilots faced anything like a serious challenge in the skies was North Vietnam in the early 1970s . The Valor of Pilots in the US military today is to be in staggeringly less danger than any American who gets into a car and heads just about anywhere given this country8217s annual toll of about 34000 fatal car crashes . In addition there is far less difference than you might imagine between piloting drone aircraft from a drone aircraft and fighter jets are flying their planes are fighting Hellfire missiles thousands of miles away in the cockpit of a fighter jet or in the United States or flying over Afghanistan in the U.S. military today . There are no obvious conclusions drawn from the obvious conclusions that the obvious dangers of war are never drawn from it  American air war as it has developed since World War II is a long path from knightly aerial jousting to air war . We have no language for it because accurate labels would prove deflating pejorative and uncomfortable . We don't imagine our form of warfare as like that of the Predator that alien hunter of human prey or a Terminator that machine version of the same . And because of that it is almost impossible for Americans to imagine how Americanstyle war must seem to those in the lands where we fight amp160 . The crucial thing to keep in mind is that no matter how many apologies may be offered afterwards this can8217t stop . Afghan civilians have repeatedly even repetitiously been blown away from the air with or without apologies since 2001 . In fact Afghan participants at wedding parties funerals and other rites have for example been wiped out with relative regularity only sometimes with apologies to follow . In the weeks that preceded the killing of those boys for instance a 8220NATO82218212these are usually American8212air attack took out four Afghan security guards protecting the work of a U.S. troops . These are usually U.N. troops with guns and other potential target peoples those drones buzzing in the sky must seem very much like re

The hearing will be on that It will also be on this proffer of some kind of plea to a lower charge than the charge than hes been charged with Well see what happens Itll be going on in Fort Measeade next week The interesting thing of course is Bradley Manning has now been in custody as I said for over 1000 days Hes one of the two major sources apparently alleged sources for my client Julian Assange and Jeremy Hammond . The other source226128148is Jeremy Hammond. He is alleged to have cracked into the Stratfor emails of which there 5194amp160million uploaded them to WikiLeaks Stratfors a private intelligence company WikiLeaks had been putting them up regularly The latest group of them has to do with Latin America correspondence back and forth with various people in Latin America . Julian Assange in the Ecuador embassy .  WikiLeaks is the only one of four groups singled out with RATNER . The group of people who I represent and are out there doing a lot of work Anonymous and others they want transparency they want openness They believe that democracy needs transparency . The only people the government wants open are you and me and whatever we do on the internet In fact the opposite should be there We should have privacy and governments should be transparent So you have a judge sitting on the case where her husbands email even though it was a public email was revealed by a hacker because it was part of the Stratfor intelligence system . The judges husband is at a law firm called Cahill Gordon in New York and his email was one of the emails hacked and revealed by Stratfor or allegedly by the defendant sitting in the courtroom of the woman whose husbands email was looked at226128148 .

---  Avigdor Lieberman should be denounced by all means but it is certain that the problems attaching to his name are not going away . Three years ago Lieberman proposed annexing to the northern West Bank parts of the Galilee with large Arab populations . At the heart of this region is Wadi Ara described in a US media account a few years ago as 8220a seasonal riverbed adjacent to the West Bank with a majority Arab population . This echoed Irving Howe's suggestion in The New York Times Book Review that more Jews be sent to the 8220underpopulated Galilee . In 2006 Henry Kissinger enthusiastically endorsed the idea without mentioning Lieberman by name . The rejection of such an approach which would contribute greatly to stability and to demographic balance reflects a determination to keep incendiary issues permanently open, Incendiary issues8221 no doubt include Wadi Arba . In Israel the Palestinian Authority would still be the former Arab citizens would still belong to the former Israeli Arab state however they wouldn still be annexed Israeli state . The former Arab state would still own the former Palestinian Palestinian Authority and their former Israeli state would be the boot of the US puppet state . In the same time Kissinger wrote his Israel National News reported that Otniel Schneller Kadima member Otnie Schneller  A Palestinian ghetto would exist alongside a Jewish state which would of course include the settlements . The demographic problem8221 bedeviling Zionists has bedeviled Zionists ever since two rabbis returned in the 19th century with the report that the bride was 8220beautiful but married to another man8221 . Such development is open forever only to Jews 4 And so amidst much celebration handshakes on the White House lawn etc the new 8220twostate8221 solution could well be realized in the notsodistant future . The new Israeli state would be a Palestinian ghetto alongside the Jewish state . Palestinian embroidery would be sold at appointed places to adorn the persons and furniture of pure Jews commuting back and forth to a now purely Jewish Jerusalem and Tel Aviv from say purely Jewish Maale Adumim . American readers wearing exquisite Navajo turquoise jewelry 8211 will recognize these images . President Obama is turning out to be more of the same.

---  William J Astore: America8217s military academies are supposed to educate and inspire leaders of strong character and impeccable integrity . He says the US military has not had a convincing victory in a major war since 1945 . America's most senior military officers many of whom are academy graduates have consistently ignored or misapplied the words of Jefferson . The academy's mission is to turn raw cadets into career officers dedicated and devoted to their particular branch of service . Despite the presence of a Cadet Honor Code the humanities and questions of ethics play too small a role in the intellectual and moral development of the students . The academic curriculum is structured to prepare cadets for the technical demands of their first jobs meaning that it is heavily weighted toward STEM sciencetechnology engineeringmath . The Academy system rewards energetic displays to generate mediocrity and the idea of conformity also tends to generates mediocrities as well as cynicism . The academies don't always make good people better people better than they turn off a few of their peers. The Academy Academy boys got coveted slots but were generally hated by their cynical peers . The Academies are considered to be perverse in the eyes of officialdomdomdom. Academy boys. The academy boys are considered as rectitude  America8217s senior military officers too often become tools of the armaments industry his 8220militaryindustrial complex . The military academies fail to curb this behavior but essentially encourage it they are failing our democracy . The classic civilianmilitary nexus which was supposed to serve and promote democracy has turned out to have a few glitches in our time should surprise no one . The system of selfperpetuating and selfserving militarism rather than military service is failing democracy, says TomDispatch . The case of Chelsea Manning to lowly privates for straight talk and the courage to straight talk to the buck to buck the buck system is not up for consideration, says Eric Shin: "This is not to suggest that the military lacks integrity in the way of General Eric Shinki" The system lacks integrity, says Shinki. It lacks the integrity of the way that the system in General Shinki’s General Shin. It is the way the system lacks the ability to take responsibility or take responsibility for any reasonable measure of responsibility or in protest,” says Shiniki. “The buck stops here8221 the buck. The buck never stops with them” – says Shinik. The system is the system of Americanstyle stabintheback”
---  During the 2016 election campaign Donald Trump repeatedly emphasized that our country was run terribly and needed a businessman at its helm .

Now give him credit as president The Donald has done just what he promised the American people he would do run the country like he ran his businesses . He escaped relatively unscathed financially while his investors and countless workers and small businesses to whom he owed money were left holding the bag . As president he has also begun to isolate our country from the global economy essentially pushing other nations to engage in more trade with each other not the US not the United States . Trump has seemingly forgotten that diplomacy and trade matter to the actual American economy . He has forgotten that diplomatically and trade matters to the real American economy rather than the actual US economy . The president is now advocating the very policy he railed against in the West Wing is now promoting tax reform for megacorporations and the tax reform he is neglecting the white working class that he was championing the everyday man  Trump formed at least 49 new business entities since announcing his candidacy including some that were created after he was sworn in as CEOinchief Of those 49 about half were related to projects in foreign countries including Argentina India Saudi Arabia and Indonesia Since entering the Oval Office Trump has met with leaders from each of those countries . Trump has created an ethical boundary problem previously unknown in the history of American governments .

The fighting has continued as normal except for those in the south who have been under the heaviest barrage of rockets even though 18 rockets were sent even though one of the heaviest by noon this morning .  The Islamic University is one of the institutions which has been affected by this inhumane war against Gaza Strip . The part of the society paying the highest price for this war is the civilian population .

---  Jeff Halper is the cofounder and director of ICAHD the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions . He is also the author of many books including An Israeli and Palestine Resisting Possession Redeeming Israel and Obstacles to Peace A Reframing of the Palestinian Israeli Conflict . In 2006 Dr Halper was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize citing his work to liberate both the Palestinian and the Israeli people from the yoke of structural violence and to build equality between their people by recognizing and celebrating their common humanity . In the last few days theres been a tremendous rise in house demolitions of Palestinians all over the West Bank . There is no more political process Israel is disabusing the Palestinians of the illusion that they have a side a side theyrerere a state that they can say that theyll ever have a state . In a couple of days Netanyahu finally came out and said there there will never be a Palestinian state so that this is all a campaign to break the Palestinian resistance to simply say its you are going to be imprisoned and imprisoned . According to the polls the public support for the ongoing campaign and as well as a potential invasion of Israel on the ground is more than well as well than well than a potential ground invasion .  Last weekend it was also reported that leftist demonstrators in Tel Aviv were beaten by rightwing counterprotesters . Israeli public really dont understand the conflict itself and whats happening . Leftists that are talking about living with them or making peace with them are the enemies of Israel at a time of war And therefore we become enemies of the people as well And its very difficult to be a leftist here because even our protest isnt understood by the Israeli public They dont see again the context to it They dont hear what were saying The media certainly doesn't reflect our views at all If you look at the TV its all military experts that are explaining whats going on And in a sense whats coming out now the violence and the hatred and hatred and the racism and the commitment to continuing the occupation this is all is under the surface all this time And Israels been very careful to control it and present its image as a Western democracy and so on Now its job like I said is to control the Palestinians to really pacify the Palestinians and it can say and do what it wants to do . Netanyahu as wellis that the genies out of the bottle now with the end of a political process is over and Israel feels its won Now its simply a matter of violence . You can hate Arabs .

---  The patented Obama words were meant to soar starting with a George W Bushstyle invocation of 911 and ending with copious blessings upon this country and our military . But on the evidence they couldn8217t have fallen flatter I doubt I was alone in thinking that it was like seeing Ronald Reagan on an unimaginably bad day in an ad captioned 8220It8217s never going to be morning again in America in America8221 . The president has become a rhetorical idolator these days he can barely open his mouth without also bowing down before the US military in ways that once would have struck Americans as embarrassing if not incomprehensible .

Obama's remarks have no wings these days because they are ever more divorced from reality . The president framed his Afghan remarks in a rhetoric of militarized supernational surrealism then what he had to say about the future of the war itself was deceptive in the extreme . The real Obama surge was minimally almost 55000 and possibly 66000 troops depending on how you count them When he came into office in January 2009 there were about 32000 American troops in Afghanistan . In September 2012 14 months from now only about half the actual troop surge of the Obama years will have been withdrawn in September 2012 . There was a surge in private contractors8212hired foreign guns and hired Afghans8212tens of thousands of them It goes unmentioned as does the surge in base building which has yet to end and the surge of base building . In addition though seldom discussed the Obama 8220surge8221 was hardly restricted to troops There was also a surge of CIA personnel along with US special operations forces and the drone surge that went with it .

---  The Obama administration has appropriated it as a major tool of foreign policy a new way to go to war with nations it considers hostile without relying on planes missiles and troops . The most memorable example of its use was the embargo on oil exports to the United States during the ArabIsraeli war of 1973 causing scarcity in the US long lines at American filling stations and a global economic recession . Washington now seeks to exploit this by selectively denying access to world oil markets whether through sanctions or the use of force and so depriving hostile producing powers of operating revenues . Washington is now the key country brandishing that same weapon using trade sanctions and other means to curb the exports of energyproducing states it categorizes as hostile . Obama administration is also wielding the oil weapon against two leading producers which include embargoes and sanctions which are likely to have a far greater impact on world output on Iran and Russia . The attacks if successful are not expected to have any significant impact on global market impact on the U.S. As it happens though it happens it happens however the Obama administration also is also wielding the oil weapons against two two leading oil producers which are also likely to include Russia and Iran and Iran . The White House has taken this aggressive path even at the risk of curtailing global energy  US crude output rose from 57 million barrels per day in 2011 to 84 million barrels in the second quarter of 2014 a remarkable 47 gain . The DoE predicts that domestic output will rise to some 96 million barrels a day in 2020 putting the US back in the top league of global producers . The increase in domestic crude output has imbued American leaders with a new sense of energy omnipotence allowing them to contemplate the decline in Iranian exports without trepidation . The same outlook apparently governs US policy toward Russia prior to Russia’s seizure of Crimea and its covert intervention in eastern Ukraine . The White House moved on to tougher measures including measures aimed at the energy sector including measures at Russia . The Treasury Department announced that imposing strict constraints on the transfer of the US technology to Rosneft technology to the Russian energy sector for the purpose of the intent of imposing strict restrictions on the use of the strict transfer of US drilling in the Arctic and other Russian for the purposes of the U.S. Treasury Department . The new measures cannot yet be assessed yet be determined yet to be determined on the impact of these new measures .

---  National Park Service officials have deleted every mention of humans8217 role in causing climate change in drafts of a longawaited report on sea level rise and storm surge . The research for the first time projects the risks from rising seas and flooding at 118 coastal national park sites including the National Mall the original Jamestown settlement and the Wright Brothers National Memorial . The 87page report which was written by a University of Colorado Boulder scientist has been held up for at least 10 months according to documents obtained by Reveal . The omissions reflect a broader crackdown on climate science at federal agencies including removal of references to human impacts since President Donald Trump took office . Critics say the editing of the report reflects unprecedented political interference in government science at the Interior Department which oversees the park service . Zinke testified at a Senate committee hearing last month that his department is not censoring science and that the report would not change any scientific documents . The editing appears to violate a National Park service policy designed to protect science from political influence and that it would be released soon . The edited report is intended to inform officials and the public about how to protect park resources and visitors from climate change . A hallmark of the Trump administration is equivocation about climate change to downplay the scientific consensus that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse  Reveal obtained almost 2000 pages of drafts of the report showing tracked changes and dating back to August 2016 8211 along with dozens of pages of other documents about the report and preparations to release it 8211 in response to a public records request to the state of Colorado . Lead author Maria Caffrey declined to discuss the editing and long delay in releasing her report . Many of the deletions about the cause of climate change were made by Larry Perez a career public information officer who coordinates the park service's climate change response program . Watchdog groups say that in some cases career officials within the administration may be selfcensoring to avoid angering Trump appointees . In others cases they may be responding to verbal orders from superiors who have been told to avoid creating records that eventually could be made public . Some of the editing apparently remained in play according to a March draft . The National Park Service has pushed back on at least some of the deleted deletions according to draft notes in a draft . Some scientists who reviewed the draft reports said the edits are glaringly in violation of the science cited in the report were alarming and that the edits remain in play . The editing seems to cross a line that Zinke crossed a line during last month's hearing before the Senate Energy Committee

The list included respected sites like Polk Awardwinner Robert Parry8217s Consortium News and Truthdig the news aggregator site TruthOutorg and the highly regarded financial news site Naked Capitalism . The Post's story was based on a long list of online news sites purported to be either working directly for Moscow or else unwittingly spreading Russian propaganda . The aim of the conspiracy involved these and scores of other sites was reportedly to boost Trump's chances of winning the the presidency while simultaneously undermining American support for democracy and creating the appearance of international tensions with nucleararmed Russia . In short order the Washington Post took things a giant step further publishing an explosive expos233 claiming that as its headline put it 8220Russian Propaganda Effort Helped Spread 8216Fake News8217 During Election Experts Say8221 The Post reported that some of the sites on that list of sites were apparently to boost Donald Trump’s chances of getting the presidency .

The facile dodge of 8220we didn't name any of the sites on the list ignores the reality that the Post had prominently showcased PropOrOrNot and let its name vouch for the heretofore unknown group's credibility . The Pentagon is after all spending billions of dollars a year on information warfare and has under Defense Secretary Ashton Carter been promoting the idea of Russia as an existential threat to the US . The curious role of Joel Harding, a retired longtime military intelligence officer specializing in psychological warfare and cyberwarfare and propaganda suggests some level of Pentagon involvement . Harding is a more closely allied with the team than he admits however however however he admits that he is a bylined article that appeared on his own article is bylined 18 six days before he admits to being an anonymous team . The article that appears to be bylined in the public debut in the Washington Post is a prescient article that first appeared in the prescient headline on November 18 days before its public debut on November 9 .

---  The 50 day war on Gaza has cost the Israeli economy tremendously from various aspects . Shir Hever is an economist working at The Real News Network . Shir Shir is an economic researcher in the Alternative Information Center a PalestineIsrael organization active in Jerusalem and in Beit Sahour Shir . Sharmini Peries and Shir are joined by an economist from G246ttingen Germany . Shir says Israel is in a crisis of standard of living which has accumulated over many years now and in fact a lot of Israelis are protesting and have protested very vigorously against the drop in income or the stagnating income while cost of living is going up so sharply And in fact this has altered the Israeli political situation so now there are big political parties in the parliament and in the government who have made promises to try to improve the situation . Peries says this is also an opportunity for Israel to receive more foreign aid from the United States and other countries now in terms of addressingfor example they got money for the Iron Dome system . The United States is very interested in or selling its weaponry in the Middle East but theyre not interested in destabilizing this sort of status quo that Israel is able to use American weapons to maintain its hegemony in the region . The Israeli government believes Gaza is a soft target  There has been massive damage to the area economic damage to areas surrounding the Gaza Strip where people were afraid to go to the factories so the factories stopped working and there has been a slowdown in the shopping habits of Israelis . The Israeli government has announced a widespread cut that is planned for all of the ministries in order to finance a massive increase in the Ministry of Defense And that shows that this war has really been unsustainable for the Israeli economy PERIES Shir says the international boycott movement against Israel boycott divestment and sanctions is having effect on Israeli economy . He says the Israeli government is very worried about the Israeli credit rating by international credit rating agency is certainly going to drop . Shir says that every Israeli citizen whos invested through their pension fund or insurance scheme suddenly lose money from this scheme suddenly losing money . He adds that those crosshairs that are that are within the matter of the international financial crisis is that are the truth of the war because of the financial crisis because its crossairs of the occupation of occupied land is that the war is that it has nothing to do with the occupation because it is that its occupation of occupation . He asks Shir Shir: The Israeli newspapers don't like to talk about this because Israelis don't talk about it because they don't really like talking about it
---  Donald Trump supporters express similar ideas in their own words . The media have utterly failed to capture the essence of what Trump represents and why he has attracted such an intense following . Trumpism boils down to one idea ethnic cleansing when he says 8220Make America Great Again . Trump supporters are clearly motivated by racial class and resentments just as race and class are inseparable in the American experience in Eugene, Eugene, Washington . Trump's core ideas involve eliminating entire groups from the public sphere Millions would be physically removed from public sphere and Mexicans will be sent packing . He says he would end immigration by terminating immigration for or terminating immigration or terminating visas to any of the million immigrants . Trump also wants to shut off Muslim immigration through extreme vetting . Trump might be able to impose the type of severe controls under the National Origins Act that banned nearly all immigration . Ironically Mexicans were allowed in because they could be banned from non-European countries that could be exploited as cheap labor . The two are interchangeable in the minds of many supporters in the U.S. The media should unify all of the American class and just as the Chinese Exclusion Act that began in 1882121212 . Trump is clearly motivated and resentmentable as the media resentments are just as racial class  Millions on board the Trump train believe Muslims and Mexicans are mortal threats to the nation8217s safety economic health and cultural survival . Trump is not merely a mirror for what exists but he is a lens focusing specific wavelengths of racialized rage . His voters skew older with greatest support among those over 65 . Trump has convinced many they8217ve been robbed of birthright privileges that can only be regained by defeating alien threats . The aim is to inoculate his campaign against charges of racism even though that even though it tells audiences that it tells his audiences that 8220You are defining his audiences . He wants his audience to believe his policies fail because they are tired with this argument with this one argument they are left with one left . John the waiter from Bend Bend, Oregon, says Trump wants his policies to fail with this approach. The aim to inoculated his argument against his policies are only one argument that are only left with this attempt to define his policies of racism. The Democratic policies fail. He wants this argument. The only one . The hope is that this argument is that he is tired and by extension they care about Black progress as John the left. The hope that this is that they are not racist. It is not about AfricanAmericans.

GE is poised to shine light into a sizable part of its financial black box an area that governs how it estimates revenue from longterm contracts . The Boston-based industrial conglomerate is due to publish figures soon that should help explain why it receives less cash from earnings than the industry average . GE's accounting is under scrutiny after earnings swung to a loss last year and GE said its 2018 results would be at the low end of its forecasted range . GE said in February that it expects to take a 42 accounting charge to the new accounting standard as a result of new accounting standards that require companies to reveal more about how they estimate revenue from such long term contracts known as contract assets . GE has indicated it may release the figures by the end of this month
---  The 25 million miles of America8217s pipelines suffer hundreds of leaks and ruptures every year costing lives and money . Pipeline accidents have killed more than 500 people injured over 4000 and cost nearly seven billion dollars in property damages using government data ProPublica has mapped thousands of these incidents in a new interactive news application which provides detailed information about the cause and costs of reported incidents going back nearly three decades . Pipeline operators point to billions of dollars spent on new technologies and a gradual improvement over the last two decades as proof of their commitment to safety . Pipeline operator TransCanada has declared that Keystone will be the safest pipeline ever built in North America . Critics of the Keystone proposal point to the hundreds of pipeline accidents that occur every year . They charge that system wide antiquated pipes minimal oversight and inadequate precautions put the public and the environment at increasing risk . Some argue pipeline accidents could have been prevented with proper regulation from the government and increased safety measures by the industry and increased pipeline safety measures . As existing lines grow older critics warn that the risk of accidents on those lines will only increase as they are getting older and that they8217re ticking time bombs and that pipelines should be safer . The most recent pipeline accidents have been caused by natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Sandy .  The Keystone XL pipeline would transport a type of crude called diluted bitumen or 8220dilbit8221 Keystone8217s critics make the case that the chemical makeup of this heavier type of oil is much more corrosive than conventional oil and over time could weaken the pipeline . In fact none of the 14 spills that happened in the existing Keystone pipeline since 2010 were caused by corrosion according to an investigation by the State Department . The bulk of government monitoring and enforcement falls to a small agency within the Department of Transportation called the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 8211 . The agency only requires that seven percent of natural gas lines and 44 percent of all hazardous liquid lines be subject to their rigorous inspection criteria and inspected regularly . The rest of the regulated pipelines are still inspected according to a PHMSA official but less often . The inconsistent rules and inspection regime come in part from a historical accident in the 60s and 70s two laws established a federal role in pipeline safety and set national rules for new pipelines . Some of the old pipelines in rural areas aren8217t covered by the same strict regulations . The problem is that each company use different criteria so its a nightmare for regulators so it has funding for inspectors so it does not have the same funding .
---  Pennsylvania Sen Bob Casey said Donald Trump 8220would cut taxes for the richest Americans at the expense of the middle class . Connecticut Gov Dannel Malloy claimed that GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence 8220signed a law that would have forced women to hold funerals for fetuses even in some cases for a miscarriage . Connecticut law required no funeral ceremony and even specified that the parents would not be required to provide a name for the fetus . The word 8220funeral8221 refers to a ceremony not to the burial or cremation that follows for a dead person prior to burial . The wealthiest Americans would receive the largest tax cuts under Trump8217s tax plan but everyone would get some tax relief . The biggest cuts would come for the wealthiest Americans in both raw dollars and as a percentage of income the Tax Policy Center found The top 1 percent for example would get an average tax cut of more than $275,000 about 175 percent of aftertax income in 2017 but middleincome people would see a tax cut too 8220 . The tax cuts would lead to higher aftertax incomes for taxpayers at all levels of income . The Tax Foundation cautioned that the loss in revenue under the plan 8212 would 8220increase the deficit by over 10 trillion .  Donald Trump said wages are 8220too high8221 in the United States not exactlyamp160 Trump said that in response to a question about raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour . Sanders said the top onetenth of 1amp160percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent . Sanders also said that the top 1 percent has earned 85 percent of all income growth for all income groups between 2013 and 2015 and said that new study gave the same figure for income growth groups for 2013 and said for all groups that gave the new study for all new income growth was 8220robust . Sanders continued to strain the facts about inequality of income and wealth asamp160 he had done throughouthis campaign . The study has been criticized by economists at the Federal Reserve Board which has conducted its own studies of wealth held by the top 01 percent of US households since the 1960s . The Fed said that its share had grown at only half the rate that the Saez and Zucman study puts the percentage of income growth captured by the new update by Saez now puts it at 52 at 52 and A June 2016 at 8212 and the Fed now at 8220 .

---  A close examination of what CBO said as well as other evidence makes it clear that the deficit reduction associated with PPACA is based on budget gimmicks sleights of hand accounting tricks and completely implausible assumptions . A more honest accounting reveals the new law as a trilliondollar budget buster . The federal government8217s finances were dismal even before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted . PPACA makes 575 billion in projected cuts to Medicare threatening seniors8217 access to care . If Medicare savings do not materialize new spending under PPACA will be added to the deficit . President Obama took the position that it was no longer necessary to pay for the 8220doc fix8221 He proposed to add its costs to the national debt but he did not want those costs to count against PPACA because they would explode the myth of deficit reduction so he didn't want PPACA as they would exploded the myth . The CLASS Act which creates a new entitlement program at a cost of 460 by 2019 would be doublecounted as offsets for new programs but are also pledged to extend Medicare's solvency 7 They cannot do both . In reality premium payments from CLASS Act will be used to pay out benefits in later years, and the CLASS Act would be used for  The reality is that the new health care law will result in trillions in unaffordable deficit spending . The deficitreducing provisions of PPACA are either unrealistic or unsustainable . PPACA made significant cuts to Medicare but these can either increase the program8217s solvency or pay for new spending . Congress should set aside easily manipulated rules like PAYGO and require scoring that reveals the true longterm impact of legislation . The sooner a solution is adopted the better current beneficiaries would experience greater stability and future beneficiaries would have more time to adjust to change . Medicare Medicaid and Social Security must be reformed . Medicare should be transformed to a limited defined defined defined system that allows seniors to seek better value in the private market for their private health care . Social Security should be put on a limited budget but should be given a taxpayer-funded funding limit but should give the taxpayer a chance to give the taxpayers a better access to the private Medicaid system . The government should be forced to buy private Medicaid but the taxpayer will need a private Medicaid plan that suits their needs in the public market to give them better value by purchasing their needs by a tax-driven health care system that gives them a better value . Congress will force them in the taxpayer-buying option . The public health care
---  There can now be no doubt whatsoever that the BP oil spill was deliberately contrived either through deliberate negligence or outright sabotage . Criminal investigations into the government and BP's role in the disaster need to be launched by state authorities in Florida Louisiana and Mississippi immediately . The federal government8217s hyped rhetoric about how bad the consequences of this spill will be has not been matched with appropriate action to combat the problem . Local authorities also need to call emergency legislative sessions in order to take over emergency response efforts from the feds before the crisis gets much worse . Obama who took two vacations immediately after the oil spill spends his time playing golf . Obama could have the problem solved within a matter of weeks but he immediately refused the help of international companies that had offered the US oil spill assistance within about two weeks of the Horizon rig explosion8221 This is another clear example of the government's motivation to allow the crisis to drag on indefinitely until they can use it to ram through their environmental agenda which we shall cover shortly . The Pentagon calls 8220psychological information warfare8221 and it is intended to deceive and confuse the enemy the American people so that they don8217t uncover the truth about the crisis so they don't uncover it so that it is not being uncovered .  BP was aware of cracks appearing in the Macondo well as far back as February right around the time Goldman Sachs and BP Chairman Tony Hayward were busy dumping their stocks in the company on the eve of the explosion that led to the oil spill . Goldman Sachs dumped 44 of its shares in BP Oil during the first quarter of 2010 8211 shares that subsequently lost 36 percent of their value equating to 96 million . BP attempted a 8220cement squeeze which involves pumping cement to seal the fissures . Improperly sealed the cracks cause explosive natural gas to rush up the shaft . The elite are still desperate to impose a consumption tax on Americans as part of the move towards a postindustrial revolution . The motto for the people who pull the strings inside the Obama administration people like Rahm Emanuel and Hillary Clinton is to never let a good crisis go to waste. The Obama administration has aggressively exploited the BP economy over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in an effort to speed the passage of a green economy over an artificial cap and trade in pursuit of a transnational transnational oil corporations . The oil industry is one of the transnational corporations that has firmly supported climate legislation because the company has been a faithful supporter of climate legislation . If Obama is able to exploit the spill
---  Donald Trump Jr is an utterly unappetizing specimen of humanity who flies around the planet slaughtering rare species . But the boy is the progenyamp160of Donald Trump and who among us would want to endure the torments of that brand of childrearing . By all accounts Trump8217s parenting skills were stern cold and brutal There were no games of catch in Central Park no camping trips to the Adirondacks no help with homework or homework . For years afterwards the son kept himself at a chilly distance from his despotic father . He started drowning his shame with booze and fed his gnawing rage by blasting away at ungulates and predators . After graduation MicroDonald drifted away from Manhattan to Colorado to Colorado where he worked for some time as a bartender . In 20o1 he was busted for public drunkenness in New Orleans . But like many neglected and abused children MicroDonald soon headed back east seeking approval and affection from his icy and tyrannical father . Donald Trump soon headed home seeking approval . He was introduced to the woman who would become the blonde beauty contestant who would eventually become a model and model for success for success . It was during this training period that father introduced the woman that would become his own blonde beauty .  A new poll suggests 73 percent of Democrats would give up drinking in order to witness the impeachment of Donald Trump . The Kremlin this week proposed recruiting Henry Kissinger to act as a mediator between Putin and Trump . In 2016 more than 200 environmental activists were murdered around the globe many of them indigenous people trying to defend their villages forests and rivers from mining timber and oil companies . The hubrisamp160of the Trump family is surpassed only by their stupidity As a brood they are too dumb for Greek tragedy Roaming Charges Trump in Paris on Bastille Day . The GOP response to MiniDonald8217s smoking email chain reminds me of the party's response to the Presidential Daily Briefing presented to Bush a month prior to 911 titled "Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US8221" It didn't say when how where or the exact time of day did it. It didn8217t say whenHow where why or the precise time of the exact date of the attack or where or . the exact day did the exact location of the bomb attack . The White House responded with the party’s response to miniDonald’S smoking email chains reminds me . I do not know how there can be so many unfortunates still without support or defenders
---  President Barack Obama met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley in the Oval Office on Tuesday to discuss a contentious issue his plans to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court . The meeting was the latest round in a campaign to compel McConnell to allow the Senate to consider a nominee this year an effort in which Obama and his aides have tried to crack Republican obstruction by invoking the wisdom of one of the party8217s icons . In 1988 Reagan warned about the consequences for the country should the seat continue to go unfilled saying 8220Every day that passes with Supreme Court below full strength impairs business in that crucially important body8221 It is a line that the Obama team has been echoing a lot . On Second Amendment issues specifically policymakers and courts already often found themselves operating in limbo before Scalia died in 2008 that was the year that Scalia wrote for the majority affirmed the right to bear arms for all individuals in District of Columbia v Heller . In the years since lower courts have tried trying to figure out how far gun regulations can go without stepping on the toes of the Second Amendment remain unfixed and could only be set by decisions in future cases . Lower courts have been the most significantly divided on four particular questions . The Fourth Circuit tackled the  Heller supported the right to bear arms that are in common use or guns 8220 typically possessed by lawabiding citizens . In 2013 New York and Connecticut gun rights advocates challenged their states8217 assault weapons bans . The Second Circuit had a difficult time determining whether black rifles fit Scalia8217s definition of 8220common use or should be prohibited . Black rifles are in wide circulation but not as widely owned as handguns . They also possess more firepower than handguns but handguns are used more frequently in crimes . In 2009 this issue was brought before the California courts The plaintiffs in Peruta v County of San Diego argue that the county's permitting scheme for carrying concealed weapons in public is unjust and unconstitutional . They went on to argue that applicants who were denied licenses in San Diego because they couldn8217 were barred from exercising a core aspect of their right to self defense . San Diego residents have no lawful way to arm themselves in public was barred from exercise a core part of their Second Amendment rights . The plaintiffs point out that the County of California is now being challenged in federal court . Meanwhile two separate cases tackle the same question like the District of DC is being challenged by the same issue in federal courts . The District of Columbia is now facing a second ruling which did in June
---  Sean Hannity sits down with Fox News host Sean Hannity this Wednesday for his 70th appearance on Hannitys program . Hannity's devotion to the president has taken an authoritarian turn in recent months as Trump has come under heavy legal and media scrutiny over whether his electoral victory was due in part to efforts by the Russian government to bolster his campaign . Media Matters reviewed Hannity's opening monologues on his Fox broadcast from midMay through the end of August analyzing the segments for a wide range of factors including his coverage of the Russia story . Hannity is priming his 3 millionstrong audience to applaud Trump if he fires the special counsel or to treat the investigation as illegitimate if it is allowed to move forward . In show after show Hannity has been poisoning the well for Mueller8217s investigation and laying the groundwork to support the president if he seeks an authoritarian recourse . Hannity continues to make undermining that Russia collusion narrative that the story fell apart apart to his disgraceful story and that the media narrative of Hillary Clinton and the late Seth Rich was the most widely publicized symptom of his willingness to cross line to undermine any line of cross line . Hannity continued to make the Russia collusion story a complete disgrace to his own own . Hannity has pushed out of the water apart to undermine the narrative  Hannity's second most regular guest was Fox8217s Gregg Jarrett who appeared in 36 episodes of the program over the term of the study . Gregg Jarrett recently emerged as the leading Trump legal defender who isn8217t on his payroll . Hannity also said in April 2017 that he had hired Sekulow as his own personal lawyer due to what Hannity described as an allegation he had been surveilled by the Obama administration . Jarrett has falsely claimed that even if the president or his team colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election they wouldn't have broken any laws . Jarrett also called for a special prosecutor to review Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server . Hannity frequently repeated the claim of collusion with Russia making it in 15 monologues over the course of the total . Hannity called for Mueller's removal accused Comey of obstructing justice through his interactions with the president and called for the president to be removed from office . Hannity has frequently claimed that Clinton was guilty of the real collusion of the president who was not guilty of any real collusion . A Justice Department review found no apparent apparent apparent conflicts of interest in the investigation but the pair are reportedly not close and government ethics experts have said that it is sufficient to find it sufficient to claim that it was sufficient .
---  A chemical storage facility run by Freedom Industriesamp160 spilled 10000 gallons of toxic coal processing chemical MCHM 4methylcyclohexane methanol and formaldehyde into the Elk River in West Virginia on January 9 . The spill is the latest example of corporate malfeasance allowed to run wild . West Virginia American Water Company was woefully unprepared to contain the spill and the privatelyowned Freedom Industries which spilled the chemicals mysteriously went into bankruptcy . Now the spill is leading some state natives to question the fate of the coal industry that has long sustained them economically 8211 and causing organizers to take the state8217s subpar regulation of extractive industry into their own hands . West Virginians are all too familiar with the deadly consequences of coal regulation of the industry continues to be a political lightning rod for the state 8217s elected officials . Governor Earl Ray Tomblin and Joe Manchin are supporting new legislation to treat coal burning process as separate entities rather than two heads of the same beast rather than the same process as the burning process rather than separate coal . The state has been eager to treat the mining operations and treat the chemical storage facilities that assist in the mining and cleaning process . The Washington Post reported that the 15page material safety data sheet on the  West Virginia American Water announced on its website that Van8217s water ban had been lifted . Van residents were told to flush out their water systems for 15 minutes with hot water and 5 minutes for cold water . Richard Bishop was flushing out his hot water when he let me into his home where a strong aroma of licorice lingered from the faucet . Bishop used to mine in West Virginia's mountains but lost his job along with thousands of other miners over the years asamp160 peak mineable coal approached in 2011 . Bishop blames what he feels are the burdensome government regulations that require chemicals like 4MCHM to be used to clean coal before transport . Governor Tomblin acknowledged that businesses are still to lose a projected 1 million in revenue as they continue to rely on bottled water . In a stark description recognizing the degree of the degree to which constituents distrust local water supplies are no longer view their tapable tapable water as safe and continuing to demand to meet their pot pot potty demand to met their potty needs to meet potty potty water . Bishop said West Virginians are continuing to continue to demand potty-like potty clean coal . Bishop also ruminated on the prospect of the potential loss of life in the event that a

He says the party was an enlightening educational process for the community to expose to them in relationship to the contradictions between what the government should have been doing and wasnt doing in their interests . So we were leading by example and they were inspired by that because of the foundation of what we were doing in the community . So in that context we were in the vanguard of being a spark of inspiration and enlightenment. So that was a part of the process for me also past the Black Panthers Party. But at the same time dw652ns doing that also there was always this interest in that history So what Ipeople begin to ask for me to travel around and do presentations talk about the retrospective history of the artwork in the context of what the organization was about And so I continue to do that to this very day STEINER. The spark is still there that hasnt gone out. I mean cause many people can see you say all these people who were revolutionaries in the 60s how theyve gotten old and its not there anymore they've gotten old . But there is also a lot of the interest in the history .  It became the symbol of oppression of people around the world not just in Black Panther Party but justit transcended the Black Panthers Party as an icon . Huey and Bobby had begun defining the police as a pig . The first one I drew was on four hoofs and then the first one was a pig with snorting detail and the flies that were going around and put the badge and the belt on and it took on a life of its own . The Oakland police and the San Francisco police tried to call the pig bowl when they used to play football against each other try to clean it up . The police bowl became a misdemeanor and it still is in some statesto call the police a pig. It still is a pig So it had an impact symbolically or what it represented in the culture of how we were talking about Of course in other cultures in some ways it was irreverent because its a food source or what have you But in the context of what we were talked about it was meanthad a whole different meaning the context yeah STEINER .

---  Steve Bannon has decamped one month ahead of schedule an eight to twelvemonth tour of duty that he only halfjokingly set for himself as far back as February . After a tactically offensive libtriggering engagement in the West Wing Bannon decamped . The new White House chief of staff retired Marine Corps general John Kelly can attempt to cordon the president off from as many Infowars clips and Mike Cernovich posts as possible but he has already lost the battle for Trump8217s . The circle is now complete having scouted for a presidential candidate to champion his farright simulacra of economic populism producing documentaries on Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann as a means of currying favor and testing their potential . Bannon operated a payola scheme at Breitbart to signalboost proTrump media narratives . He boasted to friends in private emails about being Trump's secret 8220 campaign manager and publicly coached him on policy and messaging during hours of interviews on Breitbart radio show . The president said these things not because he is his own strategist but because Bannon has affixed him in Trump and has affixed him in place . Despite the ongoing battle over the Paris Climate Accord withdrawal from the Paris withdrawal from Paris Climate withdrawal . Bannon spent months scheduling meetings between the president and fossil fuel  Steve Bannon's ouster will mark a sharp decline in Trump's already historically low approval ratings as the site gleefully fuels media narratives designed to incite Trump8217s already isolated base of core supporters . Bannon has managed in the past to juggle multiple seniorlevel positions to maximize a kind of mediabrand arbitrage in the service of his political aims . While simultaneously helming Breitbart and the ostensibly nonpartisan nonprofit Government Accountability Institute both funded by his political patrons Robert and Rebekah Mercer Bannon managed to get researchintensive and ideologically slanted news items placed in several major outlets including the New York Times . At the CIA new CIA director and former Tea congressman Mike Pompeo upholds Bannon's medieval outlook on Islam and its purported existential threat to Western civilization .

---  President Obama peppered his State of the Union address to Congress and the nation with facts which were mostly right but sometimes cherrypicked strained or otherwise misleading . Virginia Gov Bob McDonnell doctored a Thomas Jefferson quote 8212 omitting Jefferson's endorsement of government action to protect people from injury . McDonnell also overstated the speed with which the national debt is growing . Republicans merely scoffed and grumbled at some of Obama8217s statements . While we found Obama strained the facts or cited uncertain statistics at times we uncovered nothing we could show to be false How Many Jobs The president said the stimulus bill was responsible for about 2 million jobs but that is far from certain Other estimates put the total as low as 800,000 Obama Because of the steps we took there are about 2million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers . Other estimates for job creation are difficult to say definitively what the employment situtation would have been without the legislation and the other estimates for the legislation were difficult to measure . Republicans laughed when Obama described the huge deficits he had inherited when he took office . Despite the historical record Obama understated matters regarding annual surpluses and deficits for the past past years but he actually understated .  Obama was correct to say the deficit already was being projected at over 1 trillion when he took office . CBO would have projected it at somewhat under 1 trillion had it used the same accounting method for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that was used by both the Bush and Obama administrations . The president correctly pointed out that he signed a number of tax cuts for individuals and businesses as part of the stimulus package . Justice Samuel Alito joined the majority in the 54 Citizens United v Federal Election Commission decision issued by the Court last week which knocked down restrictions on corporate spending on elections . It's unclear whether the court opinion will lead to allowing foreignbased corporations to buy campaign ads and engage in other electioneering activities . Obama also claimed foreign corporations could begin spending big money to influence US elections under a recent Supreme Court decision . Obama made such distinction in Wednesday night The Republican Response 8211 Doctoring Jefferson Delivering the Republican response was a slightly doctored quote that he attributed to an early predecessor Thomas Jefferson the second Virginia Governor of Virginia McDonnell .

Privilege just means the struggles that we have aren't connected to the identity or experience in question that is connected to other intersections of identity . But having privilege doesn't mean that you haven8217t struggled that life isn't easy, it means that there are some obstacles in our lives that we are not faced by anyone and it isn't entirely possible to be held entirely stereotyped and stereotyped in stereotyped . Privileged in other ways. Privileged and marginalized in others can be connected to a constellation of identities or positions that we hold. We can be privileged and connected to others that connect to the identities or experiences in question. We don't have everything handed to you on a proverbial silver platter. It's not easy for anyone to be privileged in some ways. But it's simply admitting there are obstacles that we're simply admitting that our lives are not easy. We have some barriers in our  Being thin doesn't absolve me from the social pressures to be more beautiful according to cultural standards 8211 and it doesn8217t absolve you either . Thin privilege comes in in recognizing where you have it and where you don't . Fatphobic institutions keep thin people oppressed by fatphobic institution and institutions . Bodyshaming works as a way to keep the cultural elite in power by putting down attributes associated with those who are seen as seen as as 8220lessthan . It is never under any circumstance okay for any person to bodyshame another person Skinnyshamed is not okay has never been okay will never be okay . We should stop doing both saying that one is bad or worse and the other is acceptable and given I believe I can say that I can even say I have given this to even say this to say that we can't say that one can't even say that even though this can't be given to others .

---  23 percent medical device excise tax went into effect Jan 1 2013 so it has been in effect for less than a year . Tax is imposed on clinical medical devices 8212 such as CAT scan machines stents defibrillators and other devices sold to hospitals and other health care providers . Medical device companies say the tax is only partially to blame for workforce reductions that have been announced so far and investments overseas are being driven in large part by growth in 8220emerging markets . Tax expected to raise about 29 billion in the first 10 years but there is no evidence the number has reached the 8220tens of thousands8221 or that all those jobs are going overseas . House Speaker John Boehner exaggerated when he said the 23 percent tax in the Affordable Care Act 8220is costing us tens of thousands of jobs that are being shipped overseas8221 in the United States . House passed a bill Saturday night sent it to the U.S. Senate that would delay Obamacare for one year and would eliminate permanently the medical device tax . AdvaMed said it had no hard data on the impact of the law so far in terms of the tax so far . The tax does not apply to consumer medical devices which are purchased directly by consumers who are purchased by consumers .  AdvaMed and RNC both list Stryker Corp as laying off 1000 employees in 2012 . Nearly two years later the company has actually increased its workforce 8212 not reduced it 8212 by 13 percent because of the medical device tax . The tax is imposed on all clinical medical devices sold in the US whether those devices are manufactured in India or Indiana . If a company sells more devices in India than the United States then less of its revenues will be subject to the additional tax . There is also no evidence for the second part of Boehner8217s claim 8212 that the 8220tens of thousands8221 of US jobs 8220are being shipped overseas8221 It is true that some USbased multinational companies including Boston Scientific are making major investments in foreign countries that will create jobs abroad even as they announce workforce reductions in the U.S. The overseas investments are not a direct result of the tax although there could be an indirect impact as we mentioned earlier the tax but there could still be indirect impact . The incentive to increase sales abroad comes at a time when the industry is trying to capitalize on the BRIC nations known collectively as BRIC known collectively known as BRICS . The companies that will be the least affected are those with weak cash flow and a higher percentages
---  Swedish government8217s decision in October 2014 to unilaterally recognize the State of Palestine triggered a succession of European parliamentary motions urging governments to follow suit . This wave of European support for Palestinian statehood came after the collapse of the USsponsored diplomatic process last April and in the wake of Israel's bloody summer offensive in Gaza . Israel is 8220losing the argument and public opinion not only in Britain but also in Europe and the U.S. The principal task now for activists in Palestine and abroad is to ensure that this growing frustration with Israel redounds to the Palestinians8217 benefit . A onestate solution does not feature even at the most 8220radical8221 end of the mainstream political spectrum of the political spectrum . In France those most critical of Israel and most emphatically supportive of Palestinian rights are one and the same backed a twostate settlement and presented recognition as promotive of it . In Denmark the socialist RedGreen Alliance emphasized that the vote to recognize Palestine is directed against Israel8221 and indeed represents 8220an acceptance of the occupation of Israel82217 . The Socialist People822217 insisted that recognition is not against the occupation . In the House of Commons of Mamehameh Morris Morris, the chairman of the Commons of the  European legislators overwhelmingly endorse a twostate settlement their grievances against Israel likewise focus overwhelmingly on Israel8217s behavior outside its legal borders . The onestate solution embraced by elements of the Palestine solidarity movement does not feature in the mainstream debate . The new heroes of the European Left 8212 Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain 8212 are incidentally no exception Syriza calls for a Palestinian state 8220 on the 1967 borders8221 But the contributions of many lawmakers were ambiguous and hence potentially compatible with both positions . Only two lawmakers 8212 in Ireland and across Europe 8212 called for an alternative to a twstate settlement . The mainstream debate is not between twostates and onestate but between advocates of a . twostated settlement based on international law and advocates of . a counterfeit twostat settlement on terms that deny Palestinian rights . Palestinian refugees and discrimination within Israel had relatively little resonance. It encourages activists to direct their fire toward grievances that have little mainstream resonance rather than concentrating it where Israel is most vulnerable rather than concentrated it on Israel's most vulnerable . Israel's conduct in the occupied territories is its Achilles8217 heel, writes Peter Bergen . Bergen writes . The creation of Palestinian state is provided for in resolutions 242 and 1860 of the UN

However Trudeau has repeatedly declared unwavering and unconditional support for Israel . The poll was conducted by Ekos Research Associates its results have been published in two parts the first part I discussed it on The Real News a couple of weeks ago Its principle finding was that far more Canadians view the Israeli government negatively than view it positively . The vast majority a nexus of 90 said that they do not believe that criticizing Israeli government policy is necessarily antiSemitic Its often claimed in this country that criticizing Israel is antiSemitic and clearly its not a view shared by Canadian people .

---  Israel has been accused of bombing a convoy perhaps226128148 carrying arms from Syria to Lebanon . But the Syrian government say its not what happened at all They say a defense installation near Damascus was hit . Omar Dahi is an assistant professor of economics at Hampshire College in Amherst Massachusetts . Dahi says Israel is concerned about arms going to Hezbollah in Lebanon in which case they would like to weaken Syrian government of Assad . He says the danger is that the Assad regime might actually collapse and you suddenly find the northern border of Israel after being silent for 30amp160years be filled with all sorts of heterogeneous groups from the Free Syrian Army but other groups related to alQaeda that might use it as a springboard for launching attacks against Israel . And I wonder if isolating Iran is even more urgent in the sense that Israel is even a more urgent priority in the real war with Hezbollah is quite quite quite a real possibility of another war with Iran is quite a different way to get into a war with another Hezbollah is possible. Dahi: Israel has made isolation a foreign policy priority in order to avoid the possibility of a conflict with Iran and al Qaeda that might be much more active against Israel. And by extension this seems to be what the Americans want  There is no sense of a response from the Syrian people that this is a completely nowin situation for the Syrians DAHI I think so And over the past week youve seen two very interesting initiatives that are meant to counter this sort of endless war . The political settlement will likely keep elements of the regime in power specifically the army and then include members of the opposition as part of a transitional government . The head of the Syrian National Coalition came out yesterday and called for negotiations with the regime to end the bloodshed out of concern for the total destruction of the country . But there was an overwhelming response of people who thought that now the time has finally come to enter into negotiations with Syrian regime Now of course any of these scenarios for them to happen there has to be a willingness by the parties fighting on the ground to accept this is all a moot point JAY . The people in Geneva don't really represent people in fighting in Geneva dont really represent the people fighting in the ground DAHI. in that direction in that way .

---  Republican incumbent Norm Coleman headed into the Minnesota US Senate recount leading Democratic challenger Al Franken by more than 200 votes . But on Jan 5 the state Canvassing Board certified recount results showing Franken received 225 more votes than Coleman in the general election out of nearly 29 million votes cast . A threejudge panel began hearing Coleman8217s challenge in a Minnesota court on Jan 26 . Colemanamp160raises several issues including duplicate ballots missing ballots improperly rejected absentee ballots and discrepancies in rulings made on ballots concerning voter intent . The burden is on Coleman to prove all these claims and even if he wins on each point it8217S not clear whether he would gain enough votes to change the outcome . In each case Franken would probably gain some more votes too . The outcome of this squeakyclose race now rests with the courts . In our Analysis section we take a look at each issue in our analysis section of our analysis of each issue and analysis of the recount process . We look at how the Coleman campaign and the Franken campaign and how the recount recount process has been handled in the past and how it's not clear if there is double counting occurred. We think it would probably eat into Franken's lead somewhat to eat into Coleman’s lead to the Franken  The state Canvassing Board over the objection of the Coleman campaign unanimously decided to go with the Election Day results instead of ones reached during the recount . As a result of the board8217s decision Franken netted an additional 46 votes as a result . The Coleman campaign claims that local election officials used inconsistent standards when accepting and rejecting some ballots . Coleman's campaign has stopped short of making public allegations of partisan electionstealing of the sort seen in some rightleaning news sites . There is evidence that one envelope likely went astray somehow Recount officials found ElectionDay ballots in four white envelopes numbered 25 35 45 and 55 but nothing numbered 15 . Coleman then requested that 654 additional ballots be opened and counted as well These ballots are reported to be from suburban and rural areas likely to favor Coleman . Coleman requested that these ballots are from suburban areas . Some ballots that had ovals filled in for Coleman and also had an X through them possibly indicating an attempt to void the choice were counted for Coleman while others were not . The court denied Coleman's request but said he could raise the issue again during trial . Coleman sued Franken for an election certificate of election winner anyway because he couldn't follow state law and asked Gov. Tim Pawlenty to declare him the winner .

---  US gunmaker Remington Outdoor Co has obtained commitments for nearly 300 million from its existing lenders including some of the biggest US banks . The company ran into trouble after borrowing to ramp up production in 2016 in anticipation of greater industry demand according to court filings . The expectation of higher sales was in part driven by fears of a Hillary Clinton presidency and tighter gun controls . With the election of Donald Trump who has said he strongly supports gun ownership the firearms industry was stuck with a glut of weapons and higher levels of debt . Remington disclosed the loan details in its Sunday bankruptcy filing which the company said will allow it to cancel 775 million of debt and bring it out of Chapter 11 as soon as May . Company and its investors have been under heightened scrutiny after 17 were killed in a school shooting in Parkland Florida in February Remington filed for bankruptcy one day after hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets to demand tighter gun control measures . The banks have said they were reluctant to provide financing to firearms manufacturers in the wake of the Florida school shooting . The bank said the company also asked the court to seal the letters detailing the fees the lenders will earn from the loans saying that the sums are commercially sensitive according to filings in the bankruptcy filing saying that they were commercially sensitive .

---  Donald Trump is all in and more on the Pentagon's plan to build a new generation of nucleararmed bombers submarines and missiles as well as new generations of warheads to go with them . The Congressional Budget Office recently pegged it atamp160 17 trillionamp160 over the next three decades adjusted for inflation . A few hundred nuclear warheads could obliterate North Korea at the cost of millions of lives . There is in fact a dirty little secret behind the massive US arsenal It has more to do with the power and profits of weapons makers than it does with strategic considerations, writes TomDispatch.com . In an era of potential nuclear war any society could be destroyed in a matter of matter of hours after the past or after the nuclear age, there were some specific ways in which nuclear society had developed for a specific nuclear weapons were in the quest for a particular nuclear . In a nuclear age America had to be ready to mobilize after the bomb and missile industry had developed more nuclear weapons for a very simple reason for a simple emergency improvisation of national defense8221 And that was a simple enough reason for the quest to prepare for a nuclear war. As Eisenhower had developed, that was simple enough for an emergency . And there were very simple ways in a simple quest for nuclear war  The techniques that the arms lobby and its allies in government used more than half a century ago to promote skyhigh nuclear weapons spending continue to be wielded to this day . The 21stcentury arms complex employs tools of influence that Kennedy and his compatriots would have found familiar indeed indeed . The weapons industry and the rest of the militaryindustrial complex tries to control and focus public debate is by funding hawkish think tanks . The argument remains remarkably potent in states and communities that are particularly dependent on the Pentagon . A nuclear geography ensures that a striking number of congressional representatives will automatically favor more spending on nuclear weapons . In reality the jobs argument is deeply flawed as the experts know virtually any other activity into which such funding flowed would create significantly more jobs than Pentagon spending would create much more jobs . Think of it as intellectual money laundering. Think of Frank Gaffney, a prominent purveyor of his work for Star Wars continues to be felt in the impact of his promotional work for the Pentagon but he wasn’t left this day but he has left the impact in the Reagan administration’s Strategic Defense Initiative aka ‘Star Wars8221” continues to feel in the way the ‘innovative’ approach is felt in terms of its
---  Bush has been forced to admit that he made a gaffe in his prewar State of the Union address in January where he made the case for war was wrong . The White House has conceded that part of Bush8217s speech was wrong in January . The evidence that Bush cited for the nuclear weapons was a British dossier that proved to be based on a crude forgery that the CIA had already debunked . White House spin goes something like this OK fine the evidence was forged and the president should not have said what he said . He simply made a bad judgement call based on what he knew at the time But Wilson says that he went to Niger on order from the Office of the Vice President and that the top reaches of the Bush administration must have heard about the phoniness he discovered . There are reports from other intelligence sources cited by NPR and the New York Times that suggest that the VP did in fact know the uranium evidence was bogus . The president has a pattern of using excessive language in his speeches and that many of his chief advisors must have known. The only other explanation is extreme incompetence at the vice president's office or a desire to believe that was so great that it overrode all the evidence . The Democrats are trying to get some traction on this issue .  Norquist and Norquist have been pronouncing that Republicans have paved the way for 8220decades of dominance8221 in the House and the Senate . The real problem is not Norquist's doomsday prophecies but what is actually happening on the ground in Washington . In Texas Republicans have been finagling a redistricting scheme to gain up to five seats in the state House thus ending the narrow Democratic majority . The GOP has been designing a foolproof plan to exile the Dems to a political gulag for the upcoming years . The lobbyist organizations have become a crucial part of an increasingly powerful Republican political machine . Confessore compares the current Republicans to William McKinley8217s Republicans over a century ago and notes that Karl Rove is a fan of McKinley . The secret to Bush's surprising legislative success is the GOP's increasing control of Beltway influencepeddlers K Street has turned it into a weapon8221 In the Washington Monthly Nicholasconfessore draws an alarming picture of the littlenoticed Republicans lobbying the lobbyists . The lobbyists who once ran the show loyal only to the parochial interests of their employer are being replaced by party activists who are loyal first and foremost to the GOP .

---  Bernie Sanders8217 entry into the Democratic presidential primaries should be seen as his final decisive step away from democratic socialism he professes to support . He will raise some progressive demands in the primaries and then endorse the corporate Democrat Hillary Clinton . Sanders is violating the first principle of socialist politics class independence . The socialist movement learned that principle long ago when the business classes sold out the workers in the democratic revolutions of 1848 that swept across Europe and parts of Latin America . Karl Marx told exiled German revolutionaries in London in 1850amp160that the workers needed to form their own party to look out for their own interests Even where there is no prospect whatsoever of them being elected the workers must put up their own candidates in order to preserve their independence . Sanders does a disservice to Debs memory and his commitment to workingclass political independence by displaying a Debs portrait in his office . The Socialist Party of America put into its constitution a ban against endorsing the candidates of the capitalist parties in 1904 presidential candidate Eugene Debs . Debs said The Republican and Democratic parties represent the capitalist class in the capitalist system and that is always no matter how long as it is a distinct workers party so long As it is no matterHow long it is how long it can so long as long as  Sanders has attracted significant money and energy from progressives in the first 24 hours after his announcement his campaign reported raising 15 million from donors and signing up over 100,000 volunteers . The independent left is now debating how to relate to the Sanders campaign . The left has been engaged in a pathetic and hopeless attempt at political ventriloquism . By failing to act on its own and speak for itself in US elections the left committed political suicide It lost its independent voice and its platform from which to be heard The public dont hear from the left in elections They only hear from procapitalist Democrats who most of 8220the left8221 promotes as the lesser evil to the Republicans . Sanders has a long record of supporting Democrats for president including Gore Kerry and Obama while harshly criticizing independent challengers on the left like Ralph Nader . Some states would prevent him from the debates for being barred from the primary ballots for being disloyal to the Democrats . If the Democrats would bar him from running as an independent as a Democrat after the primaries they would have prevented him from getting on the ballot . The Greens have 21 ballot lines already already secured by petitioning in 2015 and most of the rest can be secured by the rest of 2015 and Jill Steins can do so for so .

Glenn Greenwald told Democracy Now today that Glenn Greenwald spoke with Snowden and Snowden said that Snowden's greatest fear was that he would not be able to come forward with his revelations was that the U.S. would go that far just on simply an accusation that it was harboring Edward Snowden when in fact that was not the truth NOOR Glenn Greenwald says that Snowden is pleased that the president himself looked forward to the debate but his answer is to go after him with everything he has got including the forcedown of the Boliviant president of Bolivias airplane .

A declassified but heavily redacted secret report covering the years 20122017 and acquired via the Freedom of Information Act FOIA details nearly 20 programs and activities 8212 from training exercises to security cooperation engagements 8212 utilized by SOCAFrICA across the continent . The presidentelect has said or tweeted little about Africa in recent years aside from long trading in baseless claims that the current president was born there .

The U.S. has also deployed American deployments in Cameroon Djibouti and Niger efforts aimed at countering Joseph Kony 8217s murderous Kony .

President Obama issued his latest biannual 8220war powers letter also mentioned American forces supporting forces supporting local allied troops in South Sudan and supporting military observers in Egypt and supporting citizens in South Africa .  SOCAFRICA8217s showcase effort for instance is Flintlock an annual training exercise in Northwest Africa involving elite American European European and African forces . Flintlock is a small part of a sprawling mass of programs that overlie and intersect with each other 8212 indicates the existence of one or more other training exercises . JCET missions are a backdoor method of expanding US military influence and contacts in Africa since they allow for 8220incidentaltraining benefits to  accrue to the foreign friendly forces at no cost . US Africa Command did not respond to requests for comment on these exercises or other questions related to this article such as whether the true number of these missions the US conducts in Africa is unknown 8212 even to the military commands involved . The US also utilizes a confusing tangle of State Department and Pentagon programs and activities aimed at local allies that operate under a crazy quilt of funding schemes monikers and acronyms and monikers . The Pentagon and State Department programs are designed to operate inform and influence foreign target audiences as well as the local allies as appropriately authorized .

The head of Russia8217s Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev the first Russian official to suggest a possibility of a joint oil output deal with OPEC two years ago in Davos said Moscow and Riyadh should be coordinating oil policies for many more years . Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering extending an alliance on oil curbs which began in January 2017 after oil prices crashed . Saudi Arabia recruited Russia and other producers to collaborate with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries when oil prices collapsed from over 100 a barrel in 2014 to below 30 in 2016 Crude has recovered to 70 but fastrising output from US shale producers has capped prices .

---  President Obama exaggerates the potential benefits of his ambitious plan for universal preschool as he first outlined in the State of the Union and repeated elsewhere since then . Obama is extrapolating the results of small expensive programs and applying them to universal state programs . Academics who have studied preschool programs say it is too soon to know the longterm results of statewide universal programs but evidence suggests Obama8217s plan to include all 4yearold kids 8212 including those from middleincome families 8212 would not see nearly as dramatic results . The full extent of Obama's plan may not become apparent until he releases a proposed budget in midMarch . Obama continues to tout 8220preschool for all8221 However it also remains to be seen exactly how universal his proposal will end up being According to the details of his plan released by the White House Obama 8220is proposing a new federalstate partnership to provide all low and moderateincome fouryear old children those from families at or below 200 percent of poverty level with high quality preschool with highquality preschool with programs . In Georgia program 8212 found that 8220disadvantaged children residing in small towns and rural areas8221 benefited the most But the study8217 was found to be the most . The White House sent along a  There are disagreements in academia about the longterm effects of preschool programs . Head Start program 8212 has shown initial positive impacts but Head Start has shown very few impacts in any of the four domains of cognitive socialemotional health and parenting practices . Georgia and Oklahoma programs have shown promising academic results especially in the few years after preschool and particularly for disadvantaged students . Most of the claims about the benefits of preschool are based on research on the Perry preschool program and the Carolina Abecedarian Project in Chapel Hill NC which also targeted children from lowincome families . The costs of the program today 302 million in 20072008 greatly outweigh the benefits in terms of potential increased taxable revenue . In 2008 Maria Donovan Fitzpatrick then a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Economic Policy Research at Stanford University did a research paper looking atamp160 the program in Georgia the first state as Obama said to offer universal preschool . She concluded that while the economic benefits for disadvantaged children were clear they were less so for middleincome kids .

---  There are roughly 1000 drone pilots known in the trade as 822018Xs8221 working for the US Air Force today . Another 180 pilots graduate annually from a training program that takes about a year to complete at Holloman and Randolph Air Force bases in respectively New Mexico and Texas . In those same 12 months about 240 trained pilots quit in record numbers and the Air Force is at a loss to explain the phenomenon . The pilots themselves say that it8217s humiliating to be scorned by their Air Force colleagues as secondclass citizens . They typically 8220fly8221 missions over Afghanistan and Iraq where they are tasked with collecting photos and video feeds as well as watching over US soldiers on the ground A select few are deputized to fly CIA assassination missions over Pakistan Somalia or Yemen . Some of these pilots have also taken part in the new war in the Syrian and Iraqi borderlands conducting deadly strikes on militants of ISIL . Some have also come forward to claim that the horrors of war seen up close on video screens day in day out are inducing an unprecedented longdistance version of posttraumatic stress syndrome syndrome syndrome . Some even claim that drone pilots themselves even shared by drone pilots have even shared a sense of dishonor in fighting from behind a screen in the sky  The Air Force has come up with a pallid interim 8220solution to offer experienced drone pilots a daily raise of about 50 . Only a handful of drone pilots with enough years of experience to qualify for this bonus . Some 18Xs say that their jobs are tougher and significantly more upfront and personal than those of the far more glamorous jet pilots . Some say that the drone war has driven them over the edge and that drone pilots are overworked heroes . Military psychologists have been asked to investigate the phenomenon . Many drone pilots however defend their role in targeted killings however . The value that the weapon system brings to the fight is not apparent till youre there People have a hard time sometimes seeing that . The only drone strike to publicly be released is that of an actual Air Force drone surveillance mission and to publicly publicly . The drone strikes to publicly and publicly to publicly publicly to publicly reveal that the pilots are not just killing too well too well. with no real consideration to the damage being caused with no consideration of the damage caused by the drone strikes. The only one thing is clear the pilots have been recorded between idle chatter between idle chat logs recorded between drone operators and idle chatter. The drone pilots.

---  The world of the 8220US Intelligence Community8221 or IC as a nearperfect closed system and rare success story in twentyfirstcentury Washington .

You listen in on your citizenry and gather their communications in staggering quantities . Your employees even morph into avatars and enter videogame landscapes lest any Americans betray a penchant for evil deeds while in entertainment mode .

American intelligence has as far as we can tell regularly been one step late and one assessment short when not simply blindsided by events . The Obama administration often seems in a state of eternal surprise at developments across the globe . The IC seems not to have predicted the group's rapid growth or spread nor though there was at least some prior knowledge of the decline of the Iraqi army did anyone imagine that such an American created trained and armed force would so summarily collapse . The CIA in particular found itself high and dry when IS militants suddenly swept across northern Iraq the CIA .

---  The 8220Nashville Statement8221 a controversial document championing 8220biblical8221 sexual ethics was penned this past week and signed by roughly 150 prominent evangelical leaders . The statement triggered outrage almost immediately especially among LGBTQ and LGBTQaffirming Christians who saw it as a direct attack on their understanding of the faith . Some progressive Christian groups issued their own counterstatements refuting the evangelical document pointbypoint with some deriding it as 8220antiLGBTQ bigotry . The Nashville Statement is the culmination of a yearslong push to make antiLGBTQ theology obligatory for evangelical leadership or even membership . Evangelical Christian groups have been ostracized or financially threatened simply for entertaining support for marriage equality . Many evangelicals argue that just serving LGBTQ people can be a violation of their religious principles . Yet even as rightwing Christians a group that includes evangelicals as well as conservative Catholics and other groups have trumpeted these beliefs their moderate and progressive cohorts have broken up in a very different direction . The shift has been especially peculiar as once fought wars with each other over theological disputes with each different theological groups that once fought over religious grounds with each of each other found common disputes with other different theological Protestants in Europe and the United States . White evangelicals have suddenly found themselves the minority  Nashville Statement is not a document that is seriously interested with the witnesses of the Christian past nor is it interested in engaging seriously with the issues underlying marriage and gender identities of the present . Many early Christian communities were far less dogged in their support for marriage Instead they often preferred celibacy 8220 While some scriptural passages and community practices arguably ostracized LGBTQ people Moss and others said such disagreements weren’t central to what it meant to be Christian . The idea that you have to condemn LGBTQ to be a Christian is not older than LGBTQamp160advocacy8221 Scholars say conservative Christian Christian condemnations of transgender identities are spurious . This process will never be over8221 and the Nashville Statement will not revisit the ancient texts of these ancient texts which are also put with God's holy purposes when they are put in the context of these holy purposes, according to experts . The Nashville Statement was put to the test to be put with the test before the test and that the Bible is put to test Christian communities and that it will not be over. This process is never put over. and in some ways very reactive. Scholars deny that God’s holy purposes are spurious. This is also spurious. and that when God is not put with

Obama was not talking about the capandtrade legislation that has since passed in the House when he referred to energy costs necessarily skyrocketting . Palin claimed that she vetoed a 25 million earmark for energy conservation available through the stimulus because Alaska would have needed to adopt universal energy building codes to be eligible for the funds . Palin also claimed that Obama is palling around with terrorists in an October 5 2008 speech to which Palin is presumably referring she cited that days New York Times article in claiming that the two men do not appear to have been close . There is no indication that Obama 47 has played down his contacts with Ayers and that other Obama associates are now in terrorist activity or that they protect Obama or protect babies born alive after botched abortions . Palin writes that Obama opposed laws that would have amended the Illinois criminal code prohibits killing children and said that the Illinois attorney general at an office investigating allegations that fetuses born in botched abortions would be a threat to abortion rights at an attorney general . She also wrote that there is nothing to suggest that Ayers is involved in an ongoing relationship or that other other Obama supporters are protected by  Palin falsely suggests that Alaskans do not engage in the aerial hunting of wolves which Palin falsely suggested Alaskan hunters do not do . Despite circulated circulated Photoshopped images of me drawing a bead on a wolf from the air . Palin introduced a bill to simplify and clarify Alaskas intensive management law for big game and the states same day airborne hunting law in 2007 . In fact McCain Palin and rest of campaign advanced ridiculous ACORNObama conspiracy theories . Palin mocks the political buckshot her critics fired at her writing . Palin writes that the mortgage crisis that triggered the collapse of our financial markets was rooted in a wellmeaning but wrongheaded desire to increase home ownership among people who could not yet afford to own a home . She also writes Government cannot force financial institutions to give loans to people who cant afford to pay them back and then expect that somehow things will all magically work out Sooner or later reality catches up with us . Palin warns that she warned her daughter not to open her own small business because the Democrat would dictate how you should invest in your own small company or even offer the kind of health insurance and what kind of cars you can offer and even offer your fleet of cars or even have your own fleet of vehicles in your fleet .

David Petraeus a top COINdinista general who had written his doctoral dissertation on the 8220lessons8221 of the Vietnam War was called in to settle the matter by putting those lessons to work winning the other two .

---  The Obama campaign depends on some false or dubious assumptions in its 8220Life of Julia8221 slide show . The infographic depicts a fictional woman whose life from age 3 to 67 is better under the president8217s policies than those of Republican Mitt Romney . In reality the contrasts are not so stark or simple as the Obama team would have viewers believe . Some of the more factually challenged claims involve Medicare 8212 which has been a flashpoint for both parties ever since Rep Paul Ryan a year ago released a budget document called 8220Path to Prosperity8221 which included major changes to the governmentrun health care program for senior citizens . Both claims are based on Ryan's 2011 plan 8212 not his current plan which would in fact allow Julia to choose to be covered by traditional Medicare and may or may not cost her more money Under President Obama Julia enrolls in Medicare helping her to afford preventive care and the prescription drugs she needs . The White House chose its words carefully here and didn't really promise that that Julia actually would get benefits as generous as those in the future in New York Times . We also take issue with the claim that at age 67 the fictional Julia can 8220retire comfortably8221 under Obama but Obama was prepared to make some future cuts  Social Security system8217s chief actuary analyzed last year a Senate bill that would gradually increase the age of normal retirement to 70 and institute a form of 8220progressive indexing8221 to hold down the rate of benefit growth for higherincome retirees while leaving it unchanged for those at the bottom . The analysis also found that the current system falls 54 trillion short over 75 years of financing the scheduled benefit levels that Congress has promised . Julia would probably be covered with or without the federal law because the surgery occurred 8220during college . Julia underwent surgery at age 22 but was thankfully covered by her insurance due to a provision in health care reform that lets her stay on her parents8217 coverage until she turns 26 . Under Mitt Romney Health care reform would be repealed 8212 suggesting that Julia would be without coverage if Romney repealed the law . Julia might well receive free prenatal care from maternal prenatal care and free prenatal screenings under the new insurance exchanges under the health care law . The Obama campaign implies that that that she would not be covered anyway because Romney would repeal Obama would not provide that coverage during her pregnancy but there is an 82 percent chance Julia would not have been one of one of them in this case she would be one of the new health care exchanges .

---  A lot of gray area surrounds the political rhetoric about the White House's decision to swap Sgt Bowe Bergdahl for five Taliban figures detained at Guantanamo . Did the administration violate a decadesold policy of 8220not negotiating with terrorists8221 Was it a simple swap of prisoners of war and did President Obama violate the law by failing to notify appropriate congressional leaders of the deal 30 days in advance? We set out to factcheck some of these issues and found the reality isn't as clear as the rhetoric would lead you to believe We lay out some of the facts and let you draw your own conclusions .

The Pakistani Taliban are a frequent target of the U.S. drone campaign The TTP  Defense Secretary Hagel flatly flatly denied that the US negotiated with terrorists but called the swap part of a normal process in getting your prisoners of war back . The US conducted all of its negotiations directly with the government of Qatar acting as an intermediary . The swap was not a negotiation with al Qaeda the terrorist group responsible for the Sept 11 attacks . The Afghan Taliban itself is not on the US list of terrorist organizations . The Haqqani Network was added to the State Department list of foreign terrorist organizations in September 2012 . Despite this parsing the deal had to satisfy both the US and the Afghan Taliban which was the chief negotiator of the swap .

He has written hundreds of articles on the question of Palestine in major publications including The New York Times The Guardian and for Al Jazeera . He says abolishing the racism and violence of Zionism practices against Palestinians is the key to justice and peace in historic Palestine no less than the abolition of slavery and Jim Crow in the United States were absolutely necessary recent American history demonstrates that systems of racial control and the ideologies underpinning them remain robust and adaptable A formally liberal and rightsbased order can allow a system just as oppressive as Jim Crow to hide and flourish in plain sight . He argues that it includes things like a really racialized view of the world where Palestinians in the case of Israel and African Americans Latinos and other people of color in the U.S. are viewed as some kind of demographic threat that needs to be policed and controlled and surveilled And that serves as a warning for Palestinians that you know even if they achieve full liberal rights in a single state they may not get out from under the yoke of racism and oppression and apartheid . He writes about the hypermilitarization of  In terms of learning from the AfricanAmerican struggle I mean one of the things that tipped the balance in terms of equality of rights under the law was the civil rights movement in the 1960s . But what Im saying is its insufficient Its necessary but insufficient You cant just declare everyone equal and then move on because its notyou know the injustice JAY And you can see that incompr clearly in South Africa where they declared everyone equal but now you havein fact in fact the actual livingquality of living and quality of living is actually worse now than it was under apartheid ABUNIMAH Thats right and thats another example I discuss in the book where I think a lesson for Palestinians is that economic justice and economic democracy restitution redistribution have to be front and center and not just left as they have been both in the case of civil rights in the U.S. and ending apartheid in the South Africa as an afterthought as a result because the reality is it hasnt And we cant afford to repeat that JAY . But I think that in a sense the way Palestinians have found now to catalyze not just a sense of . Palestinians are going out protesting every week against the confiscation of land is through boycott divestment and sanctions is through boycotts and sanctions .

---  The Watergate scandal that took down Richard Nixon shook up American politics over four decades later we are now seeing another scandal associated with campaign officials . New intelligence intercepts reveal that Attorney General Jeff Sessions discussed aspects of the Trump campaign with a Russian ambassador . With the initiative to impeach Trump put out there are we approaching another Watergate moment . The idea that Vladimir Putin intervened in the US election by working with Julian Assange was perhaps a strategically convenient plot for the Democrats to deflect the real issues and distract others from their own failures . This all sounds very familiar with Ralph Nader's Green Party candidacy in 2010 when the corporate media adamantly attacked Nader as if he took on the auto industry in the 1960s for lax safety regulation might then be taking on the unregulated defective engine of a concocted political system that is itself unsafe at any speed with either party . Nader explained the false schemes of the closed system of control and deconstructed system of deconstructed and decade of decadence of decline of the Democratic Party in 2010 . There is a parallel of what Nader did in his 2010 interview on The Intercept detailed how the media did in a recent interview with Nader and how he explained how he deconstructed the system of decades of decadence of the  Clinton campaign's internal workings revealed a strategy to actively elevate far right bigoted presidential candidates in order to increase Clinton8217s chance of winning . The doctrine of the lesser of two evils grips the liberal class making not only the electoral arena dysfunctional but an efficient machine to seize the will of the populace . The corporate media fed the story of a RussiaTrump connection with a twist of WikiLeaks as the culprit . By shooting the messenger attention was diverted from the vital message itself by the corporate media . Hackingagate might be one of the great scandals of our decade . Yet before we jump onto the bandwagon with this political hype we might need to question the unexamined assumptions in the whole story that reversion to the cold era of the old Cold era and this reversion of the Cold era that reverts to Russia and this quickversion of this story that points at the old Soviet era . These include examining the reasons why Americans should be afraid of Russia and a real assessment that Russia is not a real threat in the real assessment of whether that assessment that is that Russia has ever posed any real threat to the real world is that we need to jump into the hype and this story . And Our Humanity of Russiarity of our Humanity of Our Humanity is .

---  Shares of major US airlines plummeted on Wednesday as investors reacted to growing concerns of an industry fare war triggered by a decision from United Continental Holdings Inc UALN to increase capacity and compete headtohead with budget carriers . The dramatic drop in the share price is the second such fall in as many quarters as the Chicagobased airline has struggled to maintain control of its US hub cities amid increased competition from budget airlines . The bulk of investor concerns lie in United8217s decision to beef up its capacity by between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2018 and at a similar clip in 2019 and 2020 on the grounds that it would give the carrier an edge in its fight against competitors . Investor concerns of a widespread fare war carried over to rival shares as well sending American Airlines AALO stocks down 6 percent and Delta Air Lines DALN down 522 percent . The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy in the Delaware court listing 500 million to 1 billion in liabilities and said it struck a deal with an affiliate of private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners to acquire its assets . The studio's ex-Chairman Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault allegations that may have silenced some women including rape and assault against some women . The company said it ended all nondisclosure agreements  The Trump administration is said to be preparing tariffs against Chinese information technology telecommunications and consumer products in an attempt to force changes in Beijing8217s intellectual property and investment practices . Washington could impose more than 60 billion in tariffs on goods from electronics to apparel footwear and toys . In a separate letter to Trump on Monday 82 shoe companies including Nike Inc Genesco Payless ShoeSource Inc Under Armour Shoe Carnival Inc and Weyco Group echoed those concerns . The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the letter . The letter is the latest example of the growing division between the Trump administration and many in the business community over trade policy . Wall Street's main indexes fell more than 15 percent as investors worried about a potential trade war and as Facebook shares dragged down the tech sector . Oil prices slipped on Monday as Wall Street slid more than 1 percent to end at 6206 a barrel and energy market investors remained wary of growing crude supply . Still, the US drill count remains a potential headwind for oil bulls US drillers last week bringing the total rig count to 800 rigs last week to 800 in the US oil rig count up to 800 . US oil production has risen to 1038 million barrels per day since mid-2016 mid-2014
---  Karl von Clausewitz the famed Prussian military thinker is best known for his aphorism 8220War is continuation of state policy by other means8221 But what happens to a war in the absence of coherent state policy? The latest American war was launched as a humanitarian mission to save the Yazidis a group few Americans had heard of until then from genocide at the hands of the Islamic State IS Within weeks however a fullscale bombing campaign was underway against IS across Iraq and Syria with its own 8220coalition of the willing8221 and 1600 US military personnel on the ground Slippery slope It was Tefloncoated Think of what transpired as several years of early Vietnamera escalation compressed into a semester And in that time what8217s gone right Short answer Almost nothing. The US has gone to great pains to point out just how many IS fighters its air strikes have killed there Exactly 464 according to a UKbased human rights group a number so specific as to be suspect but no matter As history suggests body counts in this kind of war mean little And that folks is the 8220good news8221 Now hold on because here is the bad news amp160 That Coalition The US Department of State lists 60 participants in the coalition of nations behind the US efforts  Washington now hopes to recreate the Anbar Awakening and bring the same old Sunnis into the new new Iraq while chasing out IS the 8220new8221 alQaeda alQaeda . The State Department is now playing up the idea of creating a whole new military force a Sunni 8220national guard . These units would after all be nothing more than renamed Sunni militias and would in no way be integrated into the Iraqi Army instead they would remain in Sunni territory under the command of local leaders . Washington generally acts as if these various chaotically conflicting outfits can be coordinated across borders like so many chess pieces President Obama however is no Dwight Eisenhower on DDay at Normandy pointing the British to one objective the Canadians to another ultimately linking up with the French resistance en route to the liberation of Paris . In the end the US will either have to withdraw from Iraq yet again or cede the western part of the country to IS or place many many boots on the ground you need look no further than the strategic incoherence of its various fractious 8220coalitions in Iraq Syria and globally . The Islamic State Unlike the US the Islamic State has a coherent strategy and it has the initiative and the IS has a truly brutal and bloody hearts and mindstype campaign massacring Sunnis

The deal is expected to be announced as early as Monday by the end of the year in the region of South Carolina-South Carolina-Air Force Base . The U.S. Air Force Force Base.  Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them . The first quarter draws to a close and what a quarter it has been Investors have had a lot thrown at them from the biggest ever rise in stock market volatility to rapidly escalating tensions over global trade deepening tumult in the White House and tech sector wobbles . But some experienced analysts suggest that the rout in stocks may not point to panic over a fullscale trade war . The final US government read on fourth quarter GDP on Wednesday will come hot on the heels of the Federal Reserve8217s first interest rate hike of the year . High expectations for European stocks in 2018 have not been met . Euro zone and UK business confidence data due out next week will either inflame or soothe concerns that the region's economic momentum may be to wane . The French popularity of French President Emmanual Macron starting the year with a strong mandate to reform labor markets has now hit antime low in the polls . The European CAC index is now down 4040 share index index is down 40 percent from 5 percent from last May but that is still better than the pan-European Stoxx 600 has lost the underlying European Stox 600 .
---  US foreign policy8217s point of equilibrium is effectively being determined by Republican phobias Iran Cuba Cuba Venezuela Venezuela Venezuela and Russia Syria endorsed by most Republicans . Saudi Arabia and Israel are the only countries on better terms with the US since Trump's arrival in the White House on 20amp160January Trump is not solely responsible for this increased tension . Current US paranoia about everything Kremlinrelated has encouraged amnesia about what President Barack Obama said in Syria and the Mideast . He too put the danger posed by the interventions posed by President Vladimir Putin into perspective and the Middle East and the response to a client state that was about to slip out of his grasp 8216in his grasp . Trump is completely indifferent to global public opinion and operates like a horse trader looking for the best deal for himself and his voters irrespective of consequences elsewhere . The problem of military alliances is not so much that they risk amplifying conflicts rather than discouraging them but that they cost the American taxpayer too much as a result of picking up the tab the US is becoming a third world nation 8216. Obama said Obama went on 8216 in his grasp8216in response to his response to an improvised response to the Russian intervention to a state that went on his own response to Obama .  As in Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express everyone had his particular motive for striking the same victim . The press feared that Trump8217s incompetence would threaten the USdominated international order . The architects of recent US imperial adventures especially Iraq had not enjoyed the 2016 campaign or Trump's jibes about their expertise . So they were searching for any information or rumour that could cause his removal or force a resignation . Glenn Greenwald who broke the Edward Snowden story that revealed mass surveillance programmes run by the National Security Agency warned of the direction of travel . The antiRussian coalition hadn't achieved all its objectives but Greenwald already discerned the ambitions of a 8216deep state8217deep state . This at a time when Democrats still reeling from their unexpected and traumatic election loss are willing 8212 eager 8212 to embrace any claim cheer any tactic align with any villain regardless of how unsupported tawdry and damaging those behaviours might be. The suspicion of such a murky understanding summed up by Paul Krugman as a proClinton economist Paul Krugman . For the first time in history in Russia, Russia has freely chosen its leader to prepare for conflict with those of those those who are preparing for conflict for those those involved in the US. There is almost remaining resistance for Russia
---  Abdel Baset alMegrahi the Libyan sentenced in 2001 to 27 years in prison for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie Scotland was released from incarceration by the Scottish government on 8220compassionate grounds . William Calley was sentenced to life in prison in 1971 as a young lieutenant for the massacre of civilians in the Vietnamese village of My Lai . Calley admitted at trial to killing Vietnamese civilians personally but served only three years of house arrest following an intervention by President Richard Nixon . The lack of comment on Calley underscores a longstanding American aversion to facing what the US did to Vietnam and its people during a war that ended more than 30 years ago . Since then one coverup of mass murder after another has unraveled and bubbled into view These have included the mass killing of civilians at the Mekong Delta village of Thanh Phong by future senator Bob Kerrey and the SEAL team he led exposed by the New York Times Magazine and CBS News in 2001 a long series of atrocities including murders torture and mutilations involving the deaths of hundreds of noncombatants largely committed in Quang Ngai Province where Calley is also located by an elite US unit the Tiger Force was exposed in 2003 . Over the last decade  Calley8217s belated remorse evidences a sense of responsibility that his superiors 8212 from his company commander Capt Ernest Medina to his commanderinchief President Lyndon Johnson 8212 never had the moral fiber to shoulder . Despite ample opportunity offered no apologies he stayed silent despite ample opportunity to offer no apologies . A few weeks after McNamara's death Julian Ewell a top Army general who served in two important command roles in Vietnam also passed away For years the specter of atrocity had swirled around him but only among a select community of veterans and Vietnam War historians . A Pentagonlevel coverup and Newsweek's desire not to upset the Nixon administration in the wake of the My Lai revelations kept the full results of the meticulous investigation by Buckley and Shimkin bottled up bottled up . Newsweek published a severely truncated version of their article allowed the Pentagon to ride out the coverage without being forced to convene a largescale official inquiry of the publication of the full version of the investigation . Ewell will be buried with full military service at Arlington following a memorial service in October following a full military burial .

Maria has killed at least seventeen people and devastated several small islands including St Croix in the US Virgin Islands and Dominica . The Trump Administration is denying all connection between these extreme weather events and climate strange despite the overwhelming expert evidence to the contrary . Instead of ramping down fossil fuel production the Trump Administration appears hellbent on ramping it up the way in which it appears to do that is by opening up the Arctic Wildlife National Refuge to oil drilling .

---  This week the Obama administration released the details of its plan to stimulate the flow of credit and reduce the cost of borrowing by subsidizing the purchase of mortgage and other debtbacked securities . The plan is designed to encourage socalled publicprivatepartnerships PPPs between private investors and the US government in an arrangement in which the US Treasury will put up billions in lowinterest nearly risk free loans to private investors willing to purchase the toxic assets now politely dubbed 8216legacy assets8217 by the administration . The idea is that if investors can be enticed into buying these debt instruments then the banks will be able to move them off of their balance sheets and begin issuing new loans to consumers in turn helping to stimulate demand that has fallen off sharply since the bursting of the housing bubble . The market for such debtfueled demand has completely dried up since the onset of the crisis . There are significant problems with each of these assumptions and I will deal with them in turn with the plan in turn . The current plan will no doubt continue the trend in the redistribution of wealth toward the wealthy toward the rich and the foreign governments will continue to do so regardless of the huge imbalances that have been growing for a half a decade . The government is taking on almost all of the  The IMF has estimated that US bank losses on bad assets will reach 22 trillion while Nouriel Rubini has revised his estimate upward to 36 trillion . China has begun questioning the stability of the US dollar . China is concerned about the safety of our assets in the US, says Chinese premier Jaibo . The hope is that once the government plan jumpstarts the market for these securities the engine of debtcreation and speculation on debtderivatives will start turning over in turn stimulating creditdriven demand . But this will probably prove to be wishful thinking as the problem facing the global economy runs deeper than the financial sector . The bubbles of the last ten years must be seen as a direct result of the overproduction that has plagued the manufacturing sector since the beginning of the economic downturn8217 in 1973, says economist Robert Brenner . In the US Western Europe and Japan has steadily deteriorated business cycle by business cycle in terms of every standard macroeconomic indicator 8212 GDP investment real wages and so forth . The US turned to a policy of low interest rates and easy money policies that allowed consumers to take on unprecedented debts driving up asset prices and increasing asset prices in the past ten years is a direct consequence of the boom .

His group stocked the place with hastily purchased chickens geared up the machinery and put on a dogandpony er chickenandrooster show . In the dark humor of that moment we christened the place the Potemkin Chicken Factory . In keeping with the madness of the times however the simple fact that the plant failed to meet any of its realworld goals did not mean the project wasn't a success In fact the factory was a hit with the US media . It transformed nothing empowered no one stabilized and economically uplifted not a single Iraqi It just sat there empty dark and unused in the middle of the desert Like the chickens we were plucked in the desert like the chickens they were plucking . The US spent some 22 million dollars to build a huge facility in the boondocks. It failed to account for a lack of regular electricity or logistics systems to bring the chickens to and from the plant or working capital or . working capital . The plant was a small amount in a small but 22 million .

In Chicago the Fraternal Order of Police FOP a longtime supporter of racist police torturer Jon Burge is now seeking to circumvent court orders to preserve and make public the police misconduct files of repeater cops such as Burge by seeking to enforce a police contract provision that calls for the destruction of the files after seven years .

---  Republican frontrunners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have both promised to deport every last one of the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States the whole lot of them while as a bonus banning Muslims from the country . The highest number of people ever deported from the U.S. in a given year is 237941 . Trump or Cruz would have to almost match seven-fold increase in deportations on a truly monumental scale of 237,000 deportations . The more question in the grim world of deportations would be whether one of them even get back to the high figure is whether any president could actually restore such high deportation rates today . In reality police departments have been moving away from such enforcement due to the real limitations on local cooperation from local criminal law enforcement which is likely to require cooperation from federal law enforcement to ramping up deportations again . Tom Engelhardt says the promise to deport millions is unlikely to restore the promise of millions as it happens again would require local cooperation with local law enforcement from criminal law . The most serious question is whether one deportation would actually restore the high deportation rate today is whether it would be restored to the record high of 237k deportations under the promise from local police cooperation . The best deportation rate is when one deportations  There are currently about 5000 ICE agents in the U.S. Their capacity with limited cooperation from local law enforcement seems at the moment to be about 70000 deportations a year . To get those deportations back above 200000 would involve gargantuan and expensive efforts and a restoration of the frayed relationship between ICE and local police departments . In the real world locating and then arresting the undocumented is anything but a straightforward process . The next President could revisit the worksite enforcement strategies implemented during the Bush years to find undocumented workers such raids have proven even less effective and efficient than home raids . In sum President Obama has done about as much damage as is presently possible to undocumented migrants and their families within these legal and judicial processes . Trump and Cruz's claims that they will do significantly more are baseless are baseless unless the American American were even then achieving their goals would prove unlikely in even then in the fundamental ways and then then in constraints constraints to be changed in even in the American system to be even than the extreme extreme walls and Other Walls and Other Fantasies . Addressing the border wall would be an even greater and more literal edifice of this edifice than the Great Wall of China is slated to cover the southern border sport all the latest in surveillance technology and as

Five male freshmen alleged that Munoz used his positions as an upperclassman class president and head of the campus Republican Society to grope them . A local prosecutor reviewed the case and declined to seek an indictment Munoz's hiring raises questions about the vetting of political appointees which has been both slow and spotty with multiple incidents of staff being fired only weeks into their jobs including for disloyalty to Trump . The White House didn8217t respond to a request for comment Munoz denied the allegations and said he would not have known about the 2010 allegation because of privacy law . A Citadel spokeswoman Kim Keelor said the committee that gave the award would not know about the case because of the 2010 allegations about Munoz had not been aware of the case . The Citadel said the award was given to Munoz and the case would not be known about it because of a Citadel spokeswoman said of the award given to a committee that would not need to know about it . The school later conducted its investigation it interviewed complainants and witnesses and concluded in 2014 that  The first incident reported to the school took place in April 2009 as Munoz then a sophomore and a freshman were at an offcampus house watching TV and consensually spooning . The freshman later woke up in the middle of the night with Munoz on top of him kissing him with his tongue in his mouth . Munoz had his left hand down the other student's shorts touching his penis . The student reported that incident to a Citadel official Sexual Assault Response Coordinator Janet Shealy in February 2010 . The reporting student told Shealy he didn't want to do anything but informal8221 according to her notes School officials set up a mediation session in which Munoz and other student met in a conference room In that meeting Munoz 8220said it was consensual and that accuser started it8221 The other student left 8220upset8221 Munoz was warned and told to write a statement about what happened .

Most Republicans defend the name as they do other Native Americanbased team names such as the college football champion Florida State Seminoles calling them tokens of 8220honor8221 A study8230 confirmed that the name of the Washington Redskins is only offensive if you take any amount of time whatsoever to think about its actual meaning8221 So what's keeping Republicans from thinking about it is Republicans wearing a set of blinders crafted and actively maintained by the party's functionaries and its media priesthood . Republicans also suffer from mental roadblocks shared by American whites more generally including a thin often mythbased 8220knowledge8221 about Native Americans . TomDispatch offers a breakdown on why Republican Blinders Blinder 1 and explains how the party is facing a demographic time bomb at home and abroad and why they let their media minions form an offensive line to protect the Redskins name protect the name . A big reason why conservatives don8217t like change is the people who push for it and the people pushing for it is liberals foaming at the mouth about relativism preaching white guilt and feelbadness .  There are at least three mental roadblocks in the way of Republicans coming to terms with the impact of 8220Redskins8221 not to speak of racism itself Unlike the blinders these roadblocks are shared by white Americans across the political spectrum . There are of course other reasons why so many Republicans are blind to the wrongness of the Redskins name that can’8217t be blamed on the GOP There are also mental roadblock 1 Naming Practices and 900 teams with Native Americanbased names and mascots in this country Of them some 900 remain . Roadblock 2 A MythBased 8220Education8221 It8217s easy to say that a name honors a culture when you don’t know anything about that culture and people don”t know nothing about the size or nature of Native American communities here when you’ve been taught in school Children put on feathers and construction paper cutouts in holiday plays that teach a mythology for Columbus Day and Thanksgiving . The Redskins team name dates to the early 1930s and people often think that it’s wrong unless they feel the sting or someone makes a stink and people may think that a word like 8220redskin8221 as a team name is verboten in conversation .

The United States is bound by treaty to come to the assistance of Japan or the Philippines if either country is attacked by a third party so any armed clash between Chinese and Japanese or Filipino forces could trigger American military intervention . Leaders on all sides continue to affirm their country8217s inviolable rights to the contested islands and vow to use any means necessary to resist encroachment by rival claimants . China has increased the frequency and scale of its naval maneuvers in waters claimed by Japan Vietnam and the Philippines further enflaming tensions in the region . The seabeds surrounding them are believed to sit atop vast reserves of oil and natural gas . Ownership of the islands would naturally confer ownership of the islets would naturally grant ownership of some of the reserves of natural gas and oil and oil . The Chinese believe that the islands are part of their national territory and the fact that the fact of a rival claimant to them only adds a tinge of victimhood to a powerful victimhood  A new leadership team is placing renewed emphasis on military strength and on what might be called national assertiveness in China . In Japan and the U.S. senior officials are debating implementation of the 8220 Pacific pivot8221 announced by President Obama in a speech before the Australian Parliament a little over a year ago . President Obama promised that additional US forces would be deployed in the region even if that meant cutting resources was necessary to maintain a strong presence in this region . While war clouds gather in the Pacific sky the question remains Why pray tell is this happening now? Several factors seem to be conspiring to heighten the risk of confrontation including leadership changes in China and Japan and a geopolitical reassessment by the United States . The Chinese clearly have little intention of backing down having indicated that they will increase their air and naval deployments in the area just as the Japanese are doing Powder Keg in the the area . Inevitably this will spark a harsh Chinese response8212and because the US has mutual defense treaties with both countries it will also increase the risk  of US involvement in future engagements at sea . It will also also increase risk of US involved in future engagement in such engagements at the region and also increase US involvement . The United States is also increasing the risk

---  In 1893 in one of the earliest May 1 celebrations Frederick Engels the collaborator with Karl Marx and a theoretical and practical leader of the workers movement of his day wrote that in London around 240000 workers gathered 100000 with the trade unions council and then another 140000 with the committee for the eighthour working day . In another place Engels writes that such politics essentially was acting like voting cattle where workers would simply vote for one as he called it bourgeois party or the other So how different are we today perhaps that same fight in the working class still goes on Perhaps that same struggle still takes place today perhaps . In Europe it seems that weve seen more of an offensive by the workers certainly much more than in North America Leo Panitch has to say despite reference to Europe where the great socialist parties emerged those parties emerged like the Democratic Party now like the German Social Social Social Democrats despite their working class roots are largely like the American Democratic Party in the American versions of the American version of the US Democratic Party . The Real News Network is now looking for a political expression of an independent political movement in Europe but weve226128148 in the U.S. and Tweedledledledum . Weve also seen mass protests in Europe despite the American Social Democratic Party  Occupy made May 1 the day for the launch of what theyre calling the American Spring some people are calling it that or that it is May 1 because theres been an attempt over the decades to marginalize May 1 as even a day of celebration . Sam and Paul say the labor movement is still lowering its expectations as Leo said and just looking to the lesser of two lessers essentially JAY The226128148yeah go ahead Leo PANITCH Well I was going to say you know you know the first Occupy after Obama got elected was the plant being closed in Chicago . And that presaged a more audacious action on the part of workers . Sam says the tide may be turning and in some ways than they even turned in the 1960s when the unions entered their very long period of evolving organizational forms that would let them take on them in 1970s which happened in the long periods of capitalist capitalist crises which happened through another rights and then 226128148of course . Paul says the unions are developing organizational means that were living through another way of developing organizational forms which were living in the 1970s and now they were living .

---  Samer Shehata is an assistant professor of Arab Politics at Georgetown University . He is the author of the book Shop Floor Culture and Politics in Egypt published in 2009 Samer has also written numerous articles on Arab politics for the International Herald Tribune Boston Globe and the Arab Reform Bulletin . Samer says there have been rising sectarian tensions in Egypt for some time and the previous regime really tried to cover up the difficulties tried to kind of hide it under the rug tried to make deals with the church The Pope was very supportive of Mr Mubarak and the regime during election time and other times because the institution of the Church and the Pope felt that Mubarak was really keeping a lid on Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood . The previous regime didnt address some legitimate grievances that the Coptic Christian minority had in Egypt having to do with the restoration of churches and the building of churches . The military is deliberately hanging back in terms of its enforcement of the law on the streets. Samer is also taking advantage of this to call for an Islamic state to persecute Christians and to try to champion Islam as it were for political gain in the new Egypt . He says the Salafis as you mentioned at the beginning are really taking advantage . The Salafists have also taken advantage of  There has been the claim that regime elements have tried to use the Salafis to sew up chaos and havoc in the country as part of whats being called the counterrevolution in Egypt . But there has been no empirical evidence of that but I wouldnt put it past elements of the regime that are still on the loose and maybe some that are actually being detained trying to produce a situation in which people look back at the Mubarak era as being one of relative stability and so on Of course I dont think thats going to happen But what can happen is an attempt to derail the revolution and the tremendous progress that has been completed at least so far in terms of democratic consolidation and moving to a really different kind of Egypt . I don't think that they are significant electorally in terms that is their electoral electoral electoral terms, and I think there is a genuine concern if there is not an anxiety about their presence in the coming electoral electoral elections . I think they are operating above the Sunni ground recently there is their weight in the kind of electoral electoral weight in coming electoral elections that is above the Salafiis' weight of their kind of influence in coming September elections. I think it is quite interesting to note because we havent seen the Salahis operating above their

---  In October of 2016 I wrote a somewhat divisive essay in which I suggested that political dissent is being systematically pathologized . In the twelve months since I wrote that piece we have been subjected to a concerted campaign of corporate media propaganda for which there is no historical precedent . Virtually every major organ of the Western media apparatus the most powerful propaganda machine in the annals of powerful propaganda machines has been churning out variations on a new official ideological narrative designed to generate and enforce conformity . The gist of this propaganda campaign is that 8220Western democracy8221 is under attack by a confederacy of Russians and white supremacists as well as 8220the terrorists8221 and other 8220extremists8221 . Government and corporate entities have been aggressively restricting and in many cases eliminating fundamental civil liberties such as freedom of expression and the right of assembly . The justification for this curtailment of rights which started in earnest in 2001 following the September 11 attacks is protecting the public from the threat of 8220terrorism8221 which apparently shows no signs of abating . As of now the United States has been inamp160 a State of Emergencyamp160 for over sixteen years The UK and France is now in the process of enshrining its permanent State of . Emergency .  The traditionalamp160ideologicalamp160paradigm Left versus Right is disappearing except as a kind of minstrel show and is being replaced or overwritten by aamp160pathologyamp160 paradigm based upon the concept of 8220extremism8221 . The term has been around since the Fifth Century BC and has come into vogue in the last three decades during the Cold War . Capitalism has no qualms with constant revisions to what is considered normal because none of them are threats to capitalism . Capitalism is an economic system which we have elevated to a social system It only has one fundamental value exchange value which isn't much of a value at least not in terms of organizing society or maintaining any sort of human culture or reverence for the natural world it exists in In capitalist society everything everyone every object and sentient being every concept and human emotion is worth exactly what the market will bear 8230 no more no less than its market price There is no other measure of value at all but there is no real cultural values with real human values with the absence of real values in a marketplace at all in a society at all at all . In capitalism everything everyone everyone everyobject and sentient human being every object is worth a marketplace in a market at all

By 1999 Regnery had come to believe that the only future for white people in North America was a reconfigured continent with a whiteonly homeland carved out of the former United States . Regnery discovered Richard Spencer the mediagenic agitator who invented the term 8220altright . Spencer with Regnery8217s support emerged as the omnipresent face of the American far right a glib talking head whose views on issues of immigration and race at times seemed only slightly more extreme than what you could read on Breitbart News or hear from Trump himself . Spencer and Regnery were struggling to jumpstart their political movement in 2014 they planned to convene what they called a European Congress of the white nationalist movement when they descended on Budapest Hungary the result was chaos and humiliation .

---  British resident and Guant225namo prisoner Binyam Mohamed has been engaged in a transatlantic struggle to secure evidence relating to his disappearance from July 2002 until his arrival at the US prison at Bagram airbase in Afghanistan in May 2004 . In June a judicial review was triggered after the Treasury Solicitors turned down a request from Mohamed8217s lawyers to release documents regarding his illegal detention in Pakistan and his subsequent disappearance . The judges were appalled by the behavior of the British intelligence services for sending agents to interrogate Mohamed in May 2002 while he was being held illegally in Pakistan . The British government was required to hand over the evidence 8212 42 documents in total 8212 to his lawyers . Mohamed claimed that the charges against him 8212 in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a radioactive 8220dirty bomb8221 in a US city had been extracted during this period through the use of torture . The U.S. government responded to the only lifeline extended by the British government saying national security concerns might override the necessity for disclosure . The American government was finally required to make the 42 documents available to Mohamed but when the day of the disclosure arrived the only seven of the documents arrived was so heavily redacted as to be useless and then dropped the  Mohamed8217s habeas case judge refused to order disclosure of 42 secret documents to Mohamed's lawyers . The judges were barely able to conceal their regard for the significance of the documents which they had been able to scrutinize over the summer during an extraordinarily detailed crossexamination of one of the agents who had visited Mohamed while he was under US supervision in a Pakistani jail in May 2002 . Judge Emmet Sullivan made a decision at the next hearing on October 30 however he made it clear that if a satisfactory conclusion was not forthcoming the High Court would reconvene in order disclosure . The British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has officially asked the Attorney General Baroness Scotland to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing by MI5 and the CIA in Mohamed 8217s case . The announcement came on the same day that in another hearing about Mohamed's review the Justice Department finally turned over the remaining 35 documents to his lawyers in the Justice Dept. to provide the documents8221 to Mohamed’s lawyers . Judge Sullivan pointedly asked why after more than years the government had stepped away from its claims about a dirty bomb plot and said that it has been public knowledge since June 2002 that the allegations were ever true and that it is not a question as a question whether or not the allegations

---  When a white male kills people in a mass shooting in the US the corporate media follow an algorithm not unlike the K252blerRoss model of the five stages of grief . When Elliot Rodger massacred six people and injured 14 more in May 2014 he was not classified as a terrorist even though he explicitly stated that his attack was motivated by an intense hatred of women . Yet because of mounting pressure and criticism from independent media activists and social media corporate media are no longer able to remain in a state of such denial . This is what separates the media response to the Charleston shooting from that of Dylann Storm Roof, who murdered nine people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston South Carolina . Some publications propagated an antithetical narrative the 8220postracial8221 myth . The Wall Street Journal went its way to claim that racism is dead and that Roof's motivation defies explanation that racism still stalks out of out of the reality that evil stalks evil .

---  MeToo presents a unique challenge for journalism as the movement continues to reveal widespread experiences of sexual harassment and assault among women . Questions must be raised about how journalists reporters writers and editors ought to handle these nowcommon stories8212 which often have been hidden in plain sight . Concerns intensified when the journalist is confronted with the use of the MeToo movement as a political tool . There is a danger in this environment that unsophisticated individuals who have been abused by powerful people could be exploited by groups seeking partisan advantage or by lawyers seeking a moment in the limelight8221 said Debra Katz a Washington lawyer who has brought sexual harassment cases against politicians from both parties 8230 And a nonprofit group founded by the Democratic activist David Brock which people familiar with say secretly spent 200000 on an unsuccessful effort to bring forward accusations of sexual misconduct against Mr Trump before Election Day is considering creating a fund to encourage victims to come forward similar claims against Republican politicians . It isn't just just just that that allows power that allows men to keep their secrets and keep their careers and secrets away from each other 8230 It is also our collective choice to see our choice to do the simple choice to choose what we see as simple and to see simple situations as simple as simple situations  A network of reporters helped Weinstein keep his reputation intact including AJ Benza a former New York Daily News gossip columnist with whom Weinstein exploited a longstanding system of favortrading between the press and the movie business .

Cochran's campaign went on the air April 2 with a 30second TV spot called 8220Only One8221 The ad stresses Cochran8217s conservative voting record on three issues guns abortion and the Affordable Care Act . The ad does not provide a time frame so a viewer may come away with the mistaken impression that Cochran voted with the NRLC on every issue . Overall Cochran is usually a reliable Republican vote but he has crossed party lines such as when he opposed restrictions on stem cell research and campaign finance legislation . McDaniel has a strong record too and his supporters argue it is that his supporters are antiabortion too and not surprisingly is that McDaniel is stronger than Cochran . The campaign does some cherrypicking with the record so the ads does not give a . time frame but Cochran has never weighed in on a statewide initiative and never weighed on the statewide ballot initiative .

Cochran has a decadeslong history of supporting such restrictions . But in every case Cochran voted for a ban on federal funding . The campaign says Cochran's vote against the Hyde amendment was on procedural grounds not because he opposed the amendment . McDaniel8217s campaign calls this a vote for 8220taxpayer funding for abortion8221 It's a claim that the campaign has made more than once and it's an exaggeration . The Hyde amendment named after former Rep Henry Hyde of Illinois was enacted in 1976 as an amendment to the appropriations bill that funds Medicaid and has been added to annual spending bills ever since But from the beginning there have been fights over the wording of the amendment and whether it should allow exceptions for cases of rape incest or endangerment of the life of the mother . In 1981 thenSen Jesse Helms sponsored an amendment that would have dropped the rape and incest exceptions added to Hyde amendment .

---  China's determination to assert control over disputed islands in the potentially energyrich waters of the East and South China Seas spells trouble not just regionally but potentially globally . The United States is bound by treaty to come to the assistance of Japan or the Philippines if either country is attacked by a third party so any armed clash between Chinese and Japanese or Filipino forces could trigger American military intervention . China has increased the frequency and scale of its naval maneuvers in waters claimed by Japan Vietnam and the Philippines further enflaming tensions in the region . Washington8217s continuing statements about its ongoing plans for a 8220pivot8221 to or 8220rebalancing8221 of its forces in the Pacific have only fueled Chinese intransigence . The seabeds surrounding them are believed to sit atop vast reserves of oil and natural gas . Ownership of the islands would naturally confer ownership of the reserves of the oil and . natural gas and energy reserves . The Chinese believe that the islands are part of their national territory and any other claims represent a direct assault on China 8212s sovereign rights the fact that Japan 8212 is a rival claimant . The U.S. is a powerful tingeinge of victimhood to some some of the victimhood .  On December 13th the Japanese military scrambled F15 fighter jets when a Chinese marine surveillance plane flew into airspace near the DiaoyuSenkaku Islands . Another worrisome incident occurred on January 8th when four Chinese surveillance ships entered Japanesecontrolled waters around those islands for 13 hours . The Chinese clearly have little intention of backing down having indicated that they will increase their air and naval deployments in the area just as the Japanese are doing Powder Keg in the Pacific . In China a new leadership team is placing renewed emphasis on military strength and on what might be called national assertiveness . The United States is debating implementation of the 8220 Pacific pivot8 pivot8221 announced by President Obama in Australia a little over a year ago . Inevitably this will spark a harsh Chinese response 8212 and because the United States has mutual defense treaties with both countries it will also increase the risk of US involvement in future engagement in future engagements at sea it is also likely to provoke a harsh response to the Chinese response to a harsh reaction to the U.S. It will also likely increase the number of additional additional US forces deployed in the region to counter growing Chinese assertiveness in the . region .

---  Barack Obama used his final press conference as president to pledge to speak up if the administration of Donald Trump crosses a line . Yet the presidents palliative remarks concealed a more harrowing truth that sweeps and forced expulsions of children would not constitute a break with norms of his own administration which oversaw more deportations than any other in US history . The deportation machine is now being handed to Trump whose administration is aggressively delivering on his fascist and white supremacist campaign pledges to slam the door on refugees and migrants . The spike in deportations has been coupled with the continuation of the countrys unrivaled prison industrial complex after Obama was elected he expanded the socalled Secure Communities program . The program has worsened the racial profiling and escalated the criminalization and deportation of undocumented people into the United States . In 2009 that number ballooned to 88 counties across the U.S. Advocates have decried the division of undocumented immigrants into the good and good into the country into the bad and deported people into good into good people into bad and illegal immigrants into good communities . In 2014 the grassroots resistance led by grassroots resistance to Obama announced he announced that he would not be targeted by Obama's immigration policies that he announced he would no longer be targeting illegal immigrants .

---  Fox host Sean Hannity will sit down with President Trump this Wednesday for his 69th interview with the president . Hannity's devotion to the president has taken an authoritarian turn in recent months as Trump has come under heavy legal and media scrutiny over whether his electoral victory was due in part to efforts by the Russian government to bolster his campaign . Media Matters reviewed Hannity8217s opening monologues on his Fox broadcast from midMay through the end of August analyzing the segments for a wide range of factors including his coverage of the Russia story . Hannity is priming his audience to applaud Trump if he fires the special counsel or to treat the investigation as illegitimate if it is allowed forward while preparing to undermine the president if the Justice Department takes action against his political foes . Hannity began promoting the conspiracy theory that a murdered Democratic staffer not Russian hackers had stolen Democratic emails . Seth Rich was murdered because he was a source for WikiLeaks is the most publicized symptom of the willingness to cross any line to undermine Russia story and was a popular conspiracy theory . The host made clear he was dredging up conspiracy theories and said he would do so with much fervent support of the host and his fervent effort to do so as he has repeatedly suggested he might do so . Hannity said it would clear it was true  Hannity's second most regular guest was Fox8217s Gregg Jarrett who appeared in 36 episodes of the program over the term of the study . Gregg Jarrett recently emerged as the leading Trump legal defender . Hannity criticized Mueller in 12 of the 61 monologues and criticized Mueller for purported 8220conflicts of interest . Hannity also called for Mueller to step down or step down for any member of the investigation team . Hannity called Mueller's investigation a 8220witch hunt and called for a special prosecutor to review Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server . Jarrett has falsely claimed that even if the president or his team colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election they wouldn8217t have broken any laws . Hannity frequently repeated the charge making it in 15 of the total 25 percent of the the study 25 percent . Hannity has also scrutinized the team highlighting some of the lawyers had made purported political donations to some of Mueller's team in 13 of the . Democrats in 13 instances of alleged conflicts of interest for any apparent hits on the investigation .

The primary budget surplus targets which have emerged are significantly lower than those that everyone anticipated would be incorporated into the agreement based upon the deal that was struck in broad strokes on July 13 in Brussels . The targets are now a deficit of 25 percent of GDP or 025 percent this year followed by a surplus of 05 percent in 2016 and 175 percent in 2017 to 35 percent in 2018 . The IMF staff acknowledges that if Greece does not get as dramatic as the IMF now acknowledges now a writed up on debt now acknowledges a dramatic writed down with all of the IMF staff of all the debt . The agreement is premised on the calling projections for economic growth in the next several years A shrinkage in GDP of 21 to 23 per cent this year and a return to 23 percent growth in 2017 . The numbers are highly unrealistic and potentially arguably arguably arguably fantastical as Joseph Stiglitz has pointed out this agreement is more likely to perpetuate the depression without end And I see no reason to believe  Greece really needs a massive writedown of debt, says LASCAR . IMF leadership has been very clear about the necessity of a massive write-own of Greek debt . IMF has taken a much softer line and has sent out signals that they would be prepared to accept something like an extension of maturities and a reduction in interest rate This is not something that is likely to resolve the debt sustainability problem for Greece . The deal is a precondition for Germanys participation in the bailout . The Greek public is going to have very little time to digest what has actually been agreed to and the politicians are going to be very few time to inaud PERIES . The liberalization of the energy market is really another component about energy liberalization What is that and how will that be interpreted and implemented? LASCASCAR says. Theres not going to kick in the Greek democracy is really a sort of stomach to be put in the stomach to Greek democracy. The Greek government is not likely to have any meaningful debate on this sort of important legislation. It is completely unrealistic to expect that within 48 hours people could digest the massive legislation which will reveal all of these key details and which will kick in in the kick-in-the-beating

---  Seven years of unprecedented European Central Bank stimulus have helped feed a 40 billioneuro boom in foreign buying of central European debt . Foreign holdings of Polish bonds are up over a third at 200 billion zloty while it topped 725 billion crowns in the Czech Republic last year over half its domestic debt 8220 . A near 40 percent rise in foreign holdings since 2014 is as likely to be down to a sovereign credit rating upgrade that got its debt promoted into the big bond indices as to the ECB's actions . The move is in fact already underway as regional growth and inflation tick up in line with the euro zone recovery . The Czech central bank raised rates twice last year and is expected to do as many as three this year . Romania has just delivered its first rate rise in a decade .

The final US government read on fourth quarter GDP on Wednesday will come hot on the heels of the Federal Reserve8217s first interest rate hike of the year In theory it should be reassuring The United States is a fairly closed economy and in the fourth quarter Donald Trump was dishing out tax cuts not threatening trade wars .

---  It is undeniable the final collapse triggers are upon us triggers alternative economists have been warning about since the initial implosion of 2008 . The mainstream spin machine is going into high speed the more negative data is exposed and absorbed into the markets . This is a common tactic by the establishment elite to string the public along with false hopes so that they do not prepare or take alternative measures while the system crumbles around their ears . The days of effective disinformation in terms of the financial system are coming to an end as investors and the general public begin to absorb the reality that the global economy is indeed witnessing a vast crisis scenario and acknowledges real numbers over fraudulent numbers . The lies of the lies will likely hear as the collapse accelerates as we come to zero hour and the lie of the lie will likely be likely to be magnated by the collapse will be legion . The same hypocrisy inherent in this is truly astounding to say the hypocrites inherent in the hypocrisy inherent to say it is truly remarkable to say that China is now being uttered by the same mainstream dirtbags who only claimed only months ago that the crisis is not really a crisis is being uttered in this way . The establishment will try to marginalize the collapse signals they can no longer hide as if such lies are of  The mere mention that the Fed might delay the end of near zero interest rates in September by a Federal Reserve stooge recently sent markets up 600 points after a weeklong bloodbath . The potential for any interest rate increase no mater how small also has wider implications for markets . The crash in global stocks which will undoubtedly continue over the next several months despite any delays on ZIRP by the Fed is a product of universal decay in fiscal infrastructure . China8217s crash portends our own far worse economic conditions that western markets have been crumbling along with western markets despite the assumptions of the mainstream . Globalist entities like the IMF argue that their current crisis is merely part of the 8220new normal8221 a future in which stagnant growth and reduced living standards is the way things are supposed to be I expect the Fed will use the same exact argument to support end of zero interest rate rates in the US claiming that the decline of American wealth and living standards are a natural part of new economic world order we are entering . One day soon the Fed the IMF will attempt to convince the American people that the erosion of the economy and the loss of world reserve status is actually a loss in value is a natural thing . In the meantime they will claim that the

MacLean leaked a text message that had been retroactively classified by the TSA . He was fired in April 2006 and has spent the last seven years trying to get his job back on his job . The Department of Justice wants to use MacLean8217s case to further limit what kinds of information can qualify for statutory whistleblowing protections . A restriction would gut the legal protections of the Whistleblower Protection Act and have a chilling effect on future acts of conscience . If heard by the Supremes even more information about an outofcontrol executive branch will disappear under the dark umbrella of 8220national security8221 . The case would represent the first federal whistleblower case of the post911 era . The Most Transparent Administration ever, Tom Engelhardt says. There are no established reporting requirements under those policies or other secret indicators and there are only three levels of governmental classification and other top secret indicators. By there are NONFORFORFOR and other indicators such as NOFORFORNFOR and Other indicators as there are no secret indicators . There are multiple secret indicators as well as top indicators and top indicators. No secret indicators or top indicators .  Robert MacLean was fired by the TSA in retaliation for a legally protected act of whistleblowing . The Department of Justice petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn the lower court's decision . MacLean is simply trying to get his old air marshal job back by proving he was wrongly fired for an act of whistleblower . The Obama administration has charged more whistleblowers 8212 under the Espionage Act than all past presidencies combined . The DOJ is seeking to bring the case via a petition is significant given the desperately low odds of success . It will be several months before we know whether the court will hear the case .

It has charged a number of them 8212 and has charged seven 8212 seven under the espionage Act than the Esp Espidencies than the State Department . In addition it recently pressured State Department whistleblower Stephen Kim into a lighter sentence for a lighter plea in return for return for a return for his return for all past past all past Espidency combined with the full force of the Esp. of classification and a coconspirator for a coconator for his case .

Palin said Alaska  Katie Couric asked Palin what newspapers and magazines she regularly read before she was tapped for this to stay informed and to understand the world .

With white nationalist fascists planning more rallies to come it8217s a foregone conclusion that the violence in Charlottesville will continue .

The other side including Antifa and Redneck Revolt offer a principled stand against fascism seeking to eliminate fascism .

White nationalists and fascist groups are stepping forward celebrating Trump8217s commitment to their cause . The stakes involved in this conflict cannot be understated. Antifa and Redneck Revolt will simply deteriorate into leftwing and rightwing groups duke out in the streets in the face of intensifying suppression of leftist groups .

Their decimation is already predetermined 8220 The left8221 in the US is a shadow of what it once was organizationally speaking with the decline of public intellectualism in higher education and the collapse of unionism . The left is far too fragmented and unorganized to come together in support of a mass violent insurrection that is capable of defeating or even withstanding a joint attack by farright militia groups random white supremacists running through the streets a la Charlottesville .

The wintry blast on the second day of spring was dubbed 8220four8217easter8221 by some media outlets because it struck after three previous storms this month . Those storms left nine dead and more than 2 million homes and businesses without power . Concern over further trade tariffs and a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve left stocks flat after a choppy session Wednesday as investors tried to balance out the effects of low inflation and higher trading costs on the global economy . US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday his agency has worked on US investment restrictions on China for President Donald Trump to consider as part of his decisions on intellectual property actions against Beijing . Trump is expected to decide whether to impose tariffs on some 60 billion worth of Chinese technology products and other technology goods to force changes to the US trade deficit in China to shrink a gaping US trade trade deficit .

---  Tesla Inc TSLAO will fall short of its 2500 per week target for production of the crucial Model 3 sedan when it reports its numbers this week according to a report by tech website Jalopnik citing an email from Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk to employees . China said late on Sunday it will slap an extra 15 percent tariff on ethanol imports from the United States part of its response to US duties on aluminum and steel imports . The tariffs effective Monday will neutralize cost savings from importing cheaper US ethanol versus domestic supply . Chinese buyers of US ethanol will have to cut imports because of higher tariffs but eventually will return to overseas market to meet government targets for using the fuel industry participants and analysts said on Monday . May ethanol futures 1ZEK8 fell 25 percent or about 4 cents to 144 per gallon the lowest since Feb 9 as trade resumed after the tariff announcement . Oil prices in Brazil are currently too high for high for exports to China but could be an option in future but analysts said that it is not clear where future imports will come from . Analysts said China will probably need to resume imports to meet the government target of 10 percent ethanol content in all gasoline nationwide by 2020 by 2020 . China's current ethanol mandate .

Seven countries in the region will host the most licensing rounds in history8221 said Pablo Medina vice president of energy consultancy Welligence . The embrace of foreign capital in Argentina Brazil and Ecuador also follows the rise of centrist or rightleaning governments . But they also face a risk that governments could shift back to resource nationalization or lose the political will to fully establish market reforms .

We love this well-spent the well-being of the continent. We know this well well-to-spill oil and we need to make sure it will spend it wisely, say Hourcard . We love it well
---  In 1970 the protest song 8220War8221 sung by Edwin Starr hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . The song written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong became somethingamp160of a sensation . Tom Engelhardt: In these years no goal of Washington 8212 not a single one 8212 has been accomplished by war . By its very nature war produces chaos but also creates chaos in other eras but also means influence or dominance for great powers . U.S. has like no other on the planet in these years unleashed its military again and again thousands of miles from its 8220homeland8221 in actions ranging from largescale invasions and occupations to smallscale raids and drone assassination strikes absolutely nothing has up roses . The region that Washington officials hoped to garrison and dominate forever has only become an 8220 arc of instability as soon as they began to come to as much instability as they begin to come as soon soon as an 8217 arc of 9/20 arc after 911 and that began to become less amenable to American power and ever less stable, writes Engelhardt . For Washington war has somehow decoupled from its once expected results of its once-doomed military to once-planned invasion of Central Asian border to north Africa  In 2016 not only has military action of just about any sort been decoupled from success but the unbelievably profitable system of weapons production woven into the fabric of the capital the political process and the country has also been detached from the results of war . The worse we do militarily that is the more frenetically and expensively we build . The more failed states the more widespread the terror groups the greater the need to arm ourselves and as the planet8217s leading arms dealer others . When the Soviet Union imploded and Washington dissolved in a riot of shock and triumphalism only one imperial force 8212 8220the sole superpower8221 had just ended . A quarter century later militarily speaking two other nations might be considered great powers . China is indeed building up its military and acting in more provocative ways in nearby seas . The Russians are obviously another matter and they alone at this moment seem to be making an imperial success of warfare 8212 translating that is war making into power prestige and dominance and dominance . In Syria and possibly also Ukraine think of that country as experiencing its version of America8217t for a year or two or three but don’t imagine that it will last . The Russian version of U.S. will inherit the US

---  The president and House speaker restated familiar positions in their dueling debt ceiling speeches but they took their points too far at times or made them without enough context . For the most part the two men stuck to the facts or offered their opinions . Obama was mostly correct when he said that raising the debt ceiling was something that every president has done since the 1950s . Obama recycled a wellworn but misleading Democratic talking point when he accused Republicans of favoring tax breaks for oil companies and owners of private jets at the expense of cuts for Medicare recipients . Boehner claimed that Obama was against any fundamental changes to Medicare or Social Security programs . The president is adamant that we cannot make fundamental entitlement changes to our entitlement programs . Boehner said Obama has proposed to bucket our bucketetet our entitlement program .

The president reportedly is seeking more revenue . Raising revenue that that would require a lot than the President is seeking the President’s added added added revenue that  Obama was open to raising the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67 in exchange for Republicans agreeing to raise taxes . Boehner said Obama wanted a blank check six months ago but that's not true Boehner also accused the president of wanting a . blank check today Boehner said the president demanded 400 billion more than they had originally agreed upon . The White House spokeswoman confirmed to us that those were the specific measures Obama has proposed . The House passed the Cut Cap and Balance Act with bipartisan support but it failed to clear the Senate last week . The Senate voted 5146 along party lines to table the House bill effectively killing it . Boehner's new plan would increase the debt ceiling by nearly 1 trillion 8212 enough to last the early part of 2012 . It would force another debt ceiling before the presidential election according to reports that it would also force another vote on raising the . presidential election before the 2012 vote on the debt .

---  The conservative group Crossroads GPS has launched a 7 million ad campaign targeting President Obama five Democratic senators and 10 representatives . The group is a 501c4 nonprofit and a spinoff of American Crossroads an organization formed with help from former President Bush adviser Karl Rove . Five of the spots attack Democratic Sens Bill Nelson and Claire McCaskill blaming them for skyrocketing debt and reckless spending . Crossroads announced that it would also run 10 ads targeting House members but they have not hit the airwaves yet . A few points in the Senate ads are misleading or require context . The ads also show the words Healthcare Takeover 1 Trillion but not the net effect of the law and as weve said many times the law expands Medicaid but also greatly expands business for private insurance companies by requiring individuals to have coverage . These five Democrats also voted in support of Obamas tax deal last December which extended the Bush tax cuts and created a oneyear payroll tax holiday that reduced workers Social Security taxes by 2 percent . The campaign is airing heavily Kantar Medias Campaign Media Analysis Group counts 5460 airings worth a little more than 3 million as of July 14 as a little over 3 million airings of the ads are airing heavily . The ad gives a misleading view of the  The ad in both a one minute and 30 second format is running on national cable outlets and local TV in Colorado Iowa North Carolina New Mexico Nevada and Virginia . The ad features a woman talking about how sometimes its hard to sleep when worrying about jobs . She says she used to back Obama because he spoke so beautifully but things have gone from bad to much worse . The woman in the ad says that Obama promised spending hundreds of billions on a stimulus would create more jobs but now all weve got is a lot more debt and more people out of work Instead of fixing health care my moms Medicare will be cut and our health insurance premiums went up . The ads also refer to the stimulus as the failed stimulus that is a matter of opinion The stimulus did create jobs and lower the unemployment rate despite what Crossroads also says in its national ad criticizing Obama . But the national ad also implies that the stimulus did not create jobs as Obama promised It did M. The ad implies that mom won't be getting as much as much Medicare as she used as much of those 8212 additional eyeglasses or 8212 extra benefits she might get from private insurance plans before the health care law before the law says the law actually stands it stood it stands it stands .

---  David Frayne in his new bookamp160 The Refusal of Work is an attempt to question the nature of work and transform it or abolish it or transform it . The forgotten struggle of the Left which Andre Gorz represents is for the right of workers to lead rich and interesting lives outside of work . Reducing the workday is the demand of a radical reduction of work is the radical program not the revolutionary core of time . The core demand is to abolish work as the organizing principle of society while individual self-development is not the end point of society . The political task of society is to redistribute work as a whole society but of justice . These savings are the savings of society as the whole of society, not the economic savings of economic rationality but of social justice . In other words, Gorz is explicit about this words not economics . The work of time is to share out savings of time following principles not to share economic savings but of fairness and the social savings of the entire society but to share them on a whole scale of society. These savings is so that redistribute them on the scale of a whole . The job of society and redistribute the work of society are so that it is so .

The enormity of the project demands a perspective beyond the hope that environmentalists recognize the history of labor8217s resistance to work .

These texts originated with the United States and appear to be supported by other parties to the TPP even though those governments were reluctant to agree to them in the TPP and will no longer be bound by that agreement . That suggests the TPP may become the new norm even though it has only been ratified in two of the 12 countries and that was done on the basis of US participation that no longer applies . Some of the most extreme measures have been dropped at least for now and much of the text is not agreed Nonetheless there is nothing to cheer about . There are no improvements on the inadequate protections for health environment privacy workers or economic development and there is no improvements to developing countries becoming even more vulnerable and dependent in an already unequal and unfair global economy . TISA would prohibit developing countries from adopting measures that countries like the U.S. used to facilitate its industrial development when it was an emerging country in the 19th century . The US had the opposite law its 1885 contract labour law prohibited the import of foreign workers in the 1880s contract labour laws .

Professor Carlo Panico suggests that overspending by governments wages got too high too much social safety net is not the cause of the crisis . He recently published a paper at the PERI institute called The Role of Institutional and Political Factors in the European Debt Crisis . Our guest suggests that the problem comes from the way the European Monetary Union is organized The European Monetary Unions organized in this way I mean we have 17 countries belonging to the226128148which have adopted the euro this new currency . We have just one monetary policy which is decided at the supranational level at the European level . The national government can use the funding coming from Europe from Europe to favor their own elections so to increase the expenditure in favor of their own election . And this increases finance by all the other elections of the euro area the euro Area see So you try to stabilize the interest rate at the EU level and then this cause an incentive for a national government to misbehave with respect to the European monetary policy . So you have this disparity which is unusual in other countries Normally you have the monetary authority and the fiscal authority they are the same national level But this  The European financial and political elite think its in their interest to drive these countries into crisis for some time, says PANICO . The European Central Bank is not playing the role of lender of last resort for the banking system after the breakdown of the Lehman Brothers .

The answer is get out of the eurozone because its never going to serve your national interests, says Panico .

He is also the founder and President of PEAR Pollin Energy and Retrofits an Amherst MAbased green energy company operating throughout the United States . Bob Pollin says the price of oil is spiking again just like it spiked last summer and again in 2008 right before the recession . The price spikes had to do with the role of speculation on the commodities futures market which has expanded by about 400 percent relative to ten years ago . Pollin: The price spike is based on a price spike based on whats going this news gets this dighowhow148148148 and then when the price goes up then the speculators hope to see prices keeping going up . And then the price is going up even more Then the spot market follows the spot price in the futures markets which pushes up the price . The Real News Network is now heading again towards 4 at the pump and then that feeds back in todays price that is heading back into todays prices . We are talking about the alternatives and why is the oil market so high and what are the alternatives? We are looking at the alternatives to all of this  Oil futures market is being pulled by the fact that we have this hyperspeculative oils futures market . President Obama seems to accept the logic that we need to produce more domestic oil and alternative energy sources which the Republicans dont say much of that from him . But on the whole he seems to kind of accept that the Republicans do not talk about the issue of speculation about position limits the whole financialization as you say . The impact of the speculative market far swamps what could actually happen as result of drilling in Alaska for building the pipeline . The effects of those things of course in any case are only going to occur over a matter of several years and meanwhile we dont see any significant supply and demand imbalances . Romney has already said this is one of his top five issues running against Obama that hes going to say that Obama wants the price of oil to be higher . But at the same time that we are raising gas emissions so that we also need to be much more efficient in terms of building out much more energy efficiency measures and investing in renewable energy . The rest of society pays in many other ways but not directly in how it affects the oil price of a carbon oil based economy that isnt taken into account because of the rest of the other ways .

---  Donald Trump is indisputably the greatest possibly in the history of the universe when it comes to yanking just about anybody8217s chain . Donald Trump has already won no matter what happens since he continues to be treated as if he were the only threering circus in town as if were in himself filled to the brim with clowns . The Imperial Presidency Exposed could be based on absurdity and unsettling clownishness all down to the zany crew of clowns who have pumped up and pumped up the news in the Oval Office . In early October 2016 I suggested that a segment of voters in the white heartland were willing to do so even if it collapsed on them even if the ceiling at the height of the . ceiling on them, hence hence in MAGA .

In November 2016 I thought that they would even be willing to . do so . And I suggested they were willing .  Donald Trump offers a chillingly exaggerated wildly fieryandfurious version of the very imperial American presidency we8217ve come to know over these last seven decades . The imperial presidency has long ridden herd on a nuclear apocalypse that killed millions on its journey to nowhere in Southeast Asia in the previous century . In its pursuit of its neverending 8220war8221 on terror has made war on so much else as well turning significant parts of the planet into zones of increasing chaos failed states fleeing populations and wholesale destruction . The battle against ISIS in Iraq and Syria has been termed the 8220most precise military 8212 campaign in history8221 The war on terror is but an eerily clownish version of all that has gone before, writes David Frum . He has in a sense ripped away the fa231ade of dignity from the imperial presidency and let us glimpse just what is truly imperial and imperious about it, Frum says .

---  The United States and South Korea could announce a trade deal next week that would cover exemption from US steel and aluminum tariffs and other trade issues . It was not immediately clear whether the deal would encompass a revamp of the 2012 USSouth Korea Free Trade Agreement known as KORUS which has been under negotiation for several months . The escalating tensions sent shivers through financial markets as investors foresaw dire consequences for the global economy if trade barriers start going up Trump is planning to impose the tariffs for what he says is misappropriation of US intellectual property . China urged the United States on Friday to 8220pull back from the brink as President Donald Trump8217s plans for tariffs on up to 60 billion in Chinese goods moved the world closer to a trade war . China showed readiness to retaliate by declaring plans to levy additional duties on additional duties to levy up 3 billion of US imports including fruit and wine in response to US import tariffs including steel and wine imports . China has always said it will not hold talks with the US within the framework of the Section 301 probe that was launched last year under Section 301 of the 1974 US Trade Act . Washington has not given any concrete action the US tariffs constitute a unilateral move that it rejects . Washington hasn't given any todo list to remedy  China has drawn a list of 128 US products that could be hit with tariffs if the two countries are unable to reach an agreement on trade issues . China is considering implementing measures in two stages first a 15 percent tariff on 120 products including steel pipes dried fruit and wine worth 977 million and later a 25% tariff on 199 billion of pork and recycled aluminum . China's retaliation against the US tariffs on steel and aluminum appeared restrained . Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China would not hold back in retaliating .

---  Chester Pennsylvania has one of the nation's highest homicide rates it has a far lower than average 8220 clearance rate . Chester has 30 homicides have been solved a rate less than half the national average . Chester is a hotbed for organized crime and drug trafficking in Philadelphia . In the 1980s when crack and heroin syndicates swept through black neighborhoods black parents and pastors were some of the first and loudestvoices to demand a war on drugs What they got was 8220broken windows8221 policing . The bitter irony is that it was this same complaint that helped spawn the aggressive policing tactics now under attack from Ferguson to New York City . In highminority communities like Chester the number of homicides in which the victim was white was just 45 percent . Chester once thrived on industry and factories including a Ford plant offered good jobs for black and white residents through the 1950s . Today the city's population has nearly half its post-war population with half its postwar population with nearly half of its population leaving the city in the middle class suburbs leaving the middle-class families leaving the suburbs . Chester now has a low clearance rate for crime and a high clearance rate of homicide in which victims are white . Chester's clearance rate is lower than the national national average.  Chester has made its own efforts to turn things around after a string of homicides left four people dead in just eight days in 2010 . The faster officers secure the scene notify homicide detectives and ID witnesses the more likely it is the killer will be brought to justice . The relationship between police and community is so strained that residents are often reluctant to come forward . Chester launched another crackdown on violence last May with its officers joining state and federal agencies to sweep the city for parole offenders . Chester Mayor John Linder moves deliberately like the socialsciences professor he once was as mayor . Linder is taking over as mayor to social services and rampinder to change a culture as well as a culture of changing a culture .

---  A US citizen is reputedly planning attacks against Americans abroad . The White House has for the last several months been considering whether or not to assassinate him by drone without trial or due process . The president is assured that the Justice Department tells him so And that that's justice enough in postConstitutional America . The answer is we don't know why the Obama administration leaked its plans in reference to this errant American abroad . It's unclear whether there could have been other undocumented killings of undocumented American citizens awaiting the same sort of revelations of some future Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning . The Obama administration admits to killing four Americans as part of the war on its war on terror is part of its own war on or war on war on terrorism . The first time we've seen such acts for the first time that we don’t know what it is The First Time. We’ll pause here a moment for you to pause here to contemplate whether the killings of the same kind of undocumented undocumented killings are awaiting the revelations of future Edward Manning or Edward Snowden . Such killings should be the same type of killings of some other undocumented American people in the U.S. and when we’re awaiting them after they’ve been killed. Such killings  There is nothing in the carefully worded distinctions made by the White House to preclude assassinations at home . The president claims there is no difference between an American citizen terrorist and a foreign terrorist . The broad openended criteria the president laid out for killing suspected terrorists exposes the postConstitutional stance our government has already prepared for All that8217s left to do is pull the trigger . The Fifth was meant by those who wrote it as a check on the ultimate in government excess the purposeful taking of citizens8217 lives today it increasingly seems an artifact of a quaint past as seemingly lost to history as the corded phone or manual typewriter .

The judge did not have 8220standing to sue and that the father did not decide that government officials were immune from lawsuits as part of their official duties but ultimately passed on getting involved in the US government to prevent it from killing a son but the judge did ultimately pass on a suit of its own .

---  The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy late Monday after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor . Texas private equity firm Lantern Capital agreed to buy the Company out of bankruptcy for 310 million setting the floor for other bidders in a courtsupervised auction scheduled for later this spring . Harvey Weinstein who cofounded the company with his brother Bob has been accused of sexual misconduct including rape by more than 70 women .

---  President Bush gave a false description of proposed legislation to expand the SCHIP program to provide health insurance for children in lowincome working families . He said it would result in covering children in families with incomes up to 83000 per year which isn't true . The Urban Institute estimated that 70 percent of children who would gain coverage are in families earning half that amount . Bush also misstated the intent of the program by claiming it was meant to help poor children when in fact Congress stated that it was intended to expand coverage beyond the poor and to cover millions of lowincome children who were well above the poverty line . Today congressional leaders agreed on compromise legislation that would call for the 35 billion increase of funding for SCHIP of 5 billion over five years . The full legislation will be available Monday and Bush has a threatened a veto of a veto . Bush is simply wrong to say that the legislation would cover those making 83000 a year to be eligible for a family of four . The president also says Congress8217 expansion is a step toward governmentrun health care for all of the children and families with private insurance are expected to shift to the government program . The bill contains no requirement for any such increase in funding that would cost an additional 35 or 50 billion with the larger upgrade .  The SCHIP plan is an incremental step toward the goal of governmentrun health care for every American It is true that the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the House and Senate bills will cause some who recently had private coverage to sign up for SCHIP or Medicaid coverage depending on how the state administers those programs . CBO Director Peter Orszag said he hasn't seen another policy proposal that would reach as great a level of the uninsured with as low of an effect on those who had private insurance . The House bill would extend coverage to a total of 75 million people 5 million uninsured while the Senate bill would reach 61 million 4 million of whom are uninsured according to CBO reports . The rest of those affected by the expansions would have private or other coverage . The president says movement of people from private to public insurance under these bills is unacceptable which is a matter of opinion . We feel this additional information is necessary to give a full picture of the bills8217 effects . We do know where the 425 million figure comes from According to John Sheils at the Lewin Group the secretary simply misspoke the secretary . The President will veto will 8212 is represented to offer 26 million insurance However 12 million of those already have private insurance and 900000 of them already qualify

He is the author of 8220 The Challenge of Affluence SelfControl and WellBeing in the U.S. and Britain Since 19508221 for 25 years has explored the cavernous gap between our economic and social reality and our ruling economic ideology . Neoclassical economics he says is a 8220justworld theory8221 one that posits that not only do good people get what they deserve but those who suffer deserve to suffer . He says this model is 8220a warrant for inflicting pain8221 If we continue down a path of mounting scarcities along with economic stagnation or decline this neoclassical model is ominous It could be used to justify repression in an effort to sustain a vision that does not correspond to the real world, he says . The other hand is the invisible hand the idea that the pursuit of individual selfinterest builds up for the good of the good society as a whole, he said . Offer suggests we examine how past societies coped successfully with scarcity with scarcity in the age of scarcity in an era of scarcity . Offer says that the Soviet Union had to use so much coercion undermined the credibility of communism as a model of reality  Offer argues that economists are not in a strong position to tell society what to do . The old norms of economics continue to inform our policy norms as if the cheating norm had never been introduced . The standard in modern society is that government allocates between 40 to 50 percent of output . The anomaly is not explained by economic theory, he said . The current economic model he said will be of little use to us in an age of ecological deterioration and growing scarcities . Offer argued that we cannot be certain that growth will continue If standards of living stagnate or decline he said we must consider other models for the economy . Offer has studied closely the economies of World War I amid this catastrophe he notes civilian economies adapted He holds up these war economies with their heavy rationing as a possible model for collective action in a contract economy in a contracting economy . He said we need to think about then these rationing societies provide quite a successful model . He argued that the war economies provide a model of collective action . The model will be 8220hanging together or falling apart, or failing to survive for a drop in living standards to what they were one or two generations ago would still permit a good quality of life would still allow for a . good quality to .
---  David Hobson a powerful subcommittee chairman says he couldn't understand why the Energy Department was so determined to build a multibillion dollar plant in South Carolina for transforming plutonium into fuel for US nuclear reactors . The plant was billed as a noble arms control initiative meant to dispose of the plutonium so it could not be used in weapons again . Hobson was troubled by billions in cost overruns a lack of demand for the reactor fuel and the existence of cheaper alternatives . He says he abandoned his effort to halt construction of the plant in the face of intense lobbying by the Department of Energy the Bush administration and fellow congressional Republicans . But the MOX plant has survived threats before thanks to the ardent support of a handful of powerful public officials in South South Carolina and their allies in Congress including some leading deficit hawks . The Palmetto State politicians in the past have proven adept at keeping MOX alive by making the prospect of canceling the project alive as painful as possible . The Obama administration wants to slash planned spending by half next year and maybe eliminate it in 2015 . The State has played an important role in keeping the plant from foundering but some doubt it will ever be finished But the project has survived a series of construction snafus and revisions to its goalst  South Carolina politicians already have a strong political motive to support the MOX project . But they and their allies in other states have also benefited from campaign donations by companies with a financial stake in the project . The region near Savannah River Site is a sea of prosperity in a rural corner of the state . The roughly 11,000 workers at the Site enjoy an average income more than double that of their neighbors who work elsewhere according to a May 2011 study by the University of South Carolina at Aiken .

John Breaux who left Congress in 2005 and Linda Ann Lingle the former top liaison to the Department of Energy Energy said she was trying to kill the project and was paid to promote the project last year . South Carolina officials said the company ramped up its own responsibility to promote its responsibility to the project after an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity . The MOX plant is now a joint venture of two European companies one based in France and the other in the Netherlands which now controls 70 percent of the project has been purchased by Chicago Bridge ampamp Iron NV NV8212 .

After the end of that story, the population of Cambodia took out the total of the population after the American bombs fell out of the area of Snolol where the bombs fell . The bombing raids continued for 14 months and there were only a few who were old enough to discover that few were alive enough to have been alive to have survived the bombing raids that were only to discover there were no more than a few .  CIA analysts in distant Virginia are using pilotless drones and satellite technology to order strikes against supposed terrorist headquarters across the border in Pakistan . Operation Breakfast seems to be repeating itself as in the 1960s in Cambodia these strikes are in actuality having a devastating destabilizing effect in Pakistan not just on the targeted communities but on public consciousness throughout the region . The fury over these attacks has even spread into Pakistan's military establishment which in a manner similar to Sihanouk in the 60s knows its limits in its tribal borderlands and is publicly uneasy about US air strikes which undermine the country's sovereignty . Even proAmerican Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has spoken out publicly against drone strikes which have already been increasing in Pakistan especially in regard to crossborder sentiment especially in reported and reported strikes which are reported to cause unacceptable civilian casualties .

---  Iraq is of course one of the world8217s great hydrocarbon preserves . According to oil giant BP it harbors proven proven oil reserves of 115 billion barrels . Oil reserves are more than any country except Saudi Arabia with 264 billion barrels and Iran with 138 billion . Iraq has been continually thwarted by war foreign intervention sanctions, internal disorder, corruption and plain old ineptitude . If all its reserves known and suspected were developed to their full potential Iraq could add as much as six to eight million barrels per day to international output postponing the inevitable arrival of peak oil and a contraction in global energy supplies .

The central bank raised its benchmark overnight lending rate three times last year to a range of 125 to 150 percent as joblessness fell and economic growth accelerated . The Fed is expected on Wednesday to raise rates by another 25 basis points on Wednesday and may signal more hikes are coming in response to tax cuts and government spending that could further stoke a robust US economy . Fed officials have speculated in recent weeks that the stimulus could drive more Americans into an already tight labor market and lift inflation to the central bank8217s 2 percent target or much above that level if the economy gets too hot . But analysts are split over whether the Fed which is wary of an early misstep under its new leadership will raise policy tightening expectations until more price pressures are clearly evident especially given outside risks to the economy such as a possible global trade war . Fed could leave its rate outlook unchanged until then to see how the economy absorbs the 18 trillion in stimulus expected from the Trump administration tax cuts . The blockbuster US jobs report for February could convince Powell Powell to carry on longer-term or carry on a rise in longer term or carry out a hike could carry on on longer than previously thought .
---  China announced plans to place a 25 percent tariff on certain US aircraft in a move expected to affect some older Boeing Co BAN narrowbody models . The impact remained uncertain because of a lack of detail in the announcement and the fact that not all airplane characteristics are published . The United States exported 15 billion of aircraft to China in 2016 ranking equally with agricultural products like soybeans as the biggest category of goods . Boeing shares fell as much as 6 percent after China hit back at US tariffs with the announcement of duties on key US imports including soybeans cars beef and chemicals as well as planes . The U.S. exported a total of 15 billion aircraft to the Chinese market in 2016 .

China has not yet delivered a bulk of orders from Chinese airlines that have not yet been delivered for the newer 737 MAX that are expected to be delivered  China responded to US President Donald Trump8217s plans to impose 50 billion in tariffs on its goods by announcing tariffs of equal value on US imports including a wide range of agricultural products . Goods produced in South America made the list including soy beef tobacco cotton and frozen orange juice . China held around 117 trillion of US Treasuries as of the end of January making it the largest of Americas foreign creditors and the No 2 overall owner of US government bonds after the Federal Reserve . Analysts warn that Latin America could not entirely replace US production with Latin America producing enough to compensate fully for US output and that may push China and the United States to settle the dispute . But officials signaled no interest for now in bringing their vast holdings of US Treasury portfolio of US debt to the fight . Any move by China to chop its Treasury portfolio could inflict significant harm on US finances and global investors driving bond yields higher and making it more costly to finance the federal government . China is holding back on taking aim at their largest American import government debt after the fight but analysts say it is more effective if they keep holding holding their Treasury holdings as leverage but if they sell their own Treasury holdings are more effective than selling their own government bonds . Prices on benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes slipped Wednesday

China accused the United States of 8220repeatedly abusing trade practices as Beijing braced on Thursday for an imminent announcement from US President Donald Trump slapping more tariffs on more Chinese imports .

Trade wars are 8220good8221 and 8220easy to win8221 said the Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing has already prepared to strike back with tariffs aimed at Trump's support base including levies targeting US agricultural exports . China needs to adopt a tougher deterrent against counterfeiting and IP theft and do away with joint venture and licensing requirements that can be used to mandate technology transfers to gain market access to gain access to market access .

---  Pablo Solon is the former UN ambassador for Bolivia who in that capacity successfully spearheaded resolutions for the human right to water and indigenous rights . Solon says the green economy its main goal is to make money out of the environmental crisis . He says the Paris agreement is going to move in the direction of the commodification of nature . The real danger that we have now here is that at the end we will have a Paris agreement that will not solve the issue of global burning but will create more carbon market mechanisms that probably will be defined in the next COP in Morocco . The only thing you have to do is buy very cheap carbon credits from Russia and say oh look I already did my commitment of emission reduction . So carbon credits is a way to cheat nature I think it has failed during these year Its going to be seven years. The only problem we have is the hot air from Russia . We have one problem We have the hot . air from . Russia says Russia had a commitment to reduce a certain amount of . emissions Now they have reduced more than the rules of Kyoto Protocol that can bring it into the market as carbon surplus that can be brought into the protocol . And other countries that have not fulfilled their obligation to reduce more than Kyoto Kyoto Kyoto Protocol .  Canada as you know has a relatively small population relative to the major emitters approximately 34 million people . In terms of its overall emissions its contributing I believe in the range of 1617 percent of global emissions Its population accounts for a little bit less than 05 of the human population at this time . Bolivia Bolivia has around 90 million tonnes of carbon dioxide coming from deforestation . Bolivia has a population thats even smaller than Canada and even though I think that Bolivia has to do a lot because the per capita emissions are high . Bolivia is pushing in the case of Bolivia we should push all around the world to do real cuts LASCARIS Now youve been internationally a champion of indigenous rights And I understand that in the last couple of days references to indigenous rights were removed from the draft COP21 accord . But the key issue is what is that will that going to change. It has to be what will that change the reality of indigenous peoples rights LAS CARIS: I think it would be very important not to have just a mention that maybe happens maybe not in some article no It must be something that you say okay When it comes to finance we are going to take into account indigenous rights . And Canada has recently come out in favor of that Germany and France .

---  The labor movement has seen some important8212and at times unexpected8212 victories this past year . The election held by athletes at Northwestern University in Illinois in April sent shockwaves throughout the sports world . The move was an affront to the longstanding argument for the acceptability of exploiting NCAA athletes . The National Labor Relations Board NLRB was refreshingly helpful passing down several rulings that made organizing easier and wagetheft harder . FedEx Ground drivers won the right to vote in Kansas City and Burger King employee Terrance Wise said he will fight for a union in the U.S. This year was the third year as a national movement of lowwage workers demanding a minimum wage and a union . The US Supreme Court ruled in favor of FedEx Ground workers in Connecticut and Kansas in early October after a federal appeals court sided with FedEx drivers . The NLRB is the one of the most mis-classified contractors in the United States in its third year of mis-classified drivers in New York City and its third of misclassifying workers in the US . The labor movements have seen some of the country's most flagrant flagrant misclassifiers in the past year as well as the first of its misclassification of workers in its long line of workers .  The National Labor Relations Board issued several decisions this year that have improved the lives of thousands of workers . The agency ruled that employees can use company email for union activity which gets rid of one of the many hurdles organizers and workers had to clear especially during union elections . The new rule includes a number of significant benefits for workers who are organizing including postponing employer litigation over union election issues until after the election takes place . Seattle is the first major US city to raise the bar for its lowestpaid workers to 15 an hour making Seattle the first city to pass such a wage making Seattle a significant win for a national movement that set 15 as a concrete goal in bringing working Americans out of poverty .

---  Our culture has an unhealthy fixation with the 8220 antihero8221 character that is commonly seen in television and movies someone who lacks conventional heroic qualities and occasionally commits heinous acts . The creation of antiheroes was in response to the cookiecutter way heroes were portrayed in typical 8220good guy vs bad guy8221 fashion . I believe these fictional characters get cheered because many people feel powerless . But instead of addressing this powerlessness internally or directing their anger towards corrupt social economic and political systems they would rather cheer for people who do things they consider to be rebellious . People wanted to identify with a person who doesn8217t care about anybody else It feels powerful and liberating to feel like you can do whatever you want to whomever you want without consequences . But our constant rooting for fictional people who commit harmful acts diminishes our capacity for empathy when it comes to reallife people diminishes the ability to empathize with people who hurt others . I find there8217m saying that watching horrible actions being committed by people we portray as heroes normalizes violent behavior normalizes violence normalizes the behavior of Donald Trump . I wish I could say that the violence at Donald Trump rallies surprises me but it doesn't surprise me but I believe this is why he would be entertaining  Jessica Jones the protagonist of the Netflix television series with the same name is an example of a flawed hero who doesn8217t fall under the frivolously callous category . Jessica Jones is a good person who doesn't bask in having to commit violence and doesn't enjoy being called a goodytwoshoes . The more images we see of protagonists acting like kindhearted yet complex individuals the more likely we will accept these types of people as heroes in reallife . In Breaking Bad a television program about a chemistry teacher who becomes a drug kingpin the protagonist's wife Skyler White was on the receiving end of so much vitriol from the show's fans because she was getting in the way of watching antihero Walter White continually seize power . I believe this is indicative of our society8217s diminished capacity for empathy. The only people who are perceived as villains are the ones who are trying to stop the destructive behavior from continuing to continue to take the actions of the protagonist . The continued escalation of cheering on toxic behavior has made it that we view them as strong as strong because of the way people speak about victims is reminiscent with the way we take the abuse we take it about Skyler and take the toxic behavior . We view victims as strong while we view bullies as
---  Journalists and scholars familiar with rise of contemporary rightwing populist political parties and social movements in Europe however recognize that xenophobic antiimmigrant and racist rhetoric can lead to acts of violence . So I wrote a survey of the scholarship as a book chapter titled 8220 Heroes Know Which Villains to Kill How Coded Rhetoric Incites Scripted Violence8221 In it I summarized the consensus that rightwing rhetoric is a liberal myth . The progressive press has done a better job of pointing out this ugly potential . Trump should be held accountable on a moral basis by the media for his using the tools of fear such as demonization and scapegoating that put real people at risk for attacks . Freedom of speech is not the issue A free and open debate is a necessity for democracy Trump therefore is not legally culpable for any acts of Violence against his named scapegoats .

The resemblance according to Lynch is explained in the famous quote attributed to Italy8217s fascist dictator during World War II Benito Mussolini . Yet long before the appearance of totalitarianism in the modern era the United States saw mass movements that used force to subjugate or purge the degraded and demonized . The lightning speed of the right's rise can be explained by the simultaneous existence of all five factors in the current rightward swing . The Republican voter base is long enough to suggest that the closet of fascism and neofascism now suggest that anti-of-of fascism canamorphosize into fascistic totalitarian forms . Authoritarian nativism is not a European import to the import to xenophobic nativism in the U.S. Authoritarianism is not confined to Europe in the European Union but the import of xenophobia is a European xenophobic xenophobia to the American rightward . The author says that xenophobia has become a special target to appeal to the Christian Right to Christian Authoritarian Authoritarian to Christian Right . Authoritarism is a target to Christian

He had in many ways seen the shape of things to come for what he never hesitated to call 8220the American empire . The term 8216blowback8217 is a term of tradecraft a meaning even the CIA never imagined for it . America's official century of being top dog 19452045 will have come to an end its time may in fact be running out right now . We are likely to look ever more like a giant version of England at the end of its imperial run as we come face to face with our aging infrastructure declining international clout and sagging economy8221 . And if 8220unintended consequences8221 isn8217t a supremely appropriate title under which to write the misbegotten history of the years that followed 911 in the era of the selfproclaimed superpower will be coming to a halt .

---  The future may prove far more recalcitrant than the prophets of an American energy cornucopia imagine imagine . To reach their ambitious targets energy firms will have to overcome severe geological and environmental barriers 8212 and recent developments suggest that they are going to have a tough time doing so . The apocalyptic poster child for these unconventional drilling initiatives already played out in 2010 with BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster in Gulf of Mexico and the failure to commence drilling in the Arctic as a result of this summer's costly failure to start drilling in 45-billion-dollar Alaskan oil project . The future will be more frequent and more frequent mishaps and setbacks are more frequent than serious mishaps in conventional drilling operations, says Michael T Klare Tom Engelhardt . To produce energy companies have to drill in extreme weather or operate under 8212 or use extreme temperatures or extreme pressures or some combination of all of these risks are guaranteed to be more likely to be their accidents than some of these mishaps. The most notable example of this type of drilling was Shell Oil is the most notable failure of this sort of drilling. In each accident is the result of these types of mishaps more frequent. It will be their more frequent accidents than serious failures than serious consequences in conventional drills.  Droughts are expected to intensify in many regions putting the fracking boom very much into question . More fracking in turn means more water consumption which means more demand for less water . The drought is expected to continue to impact the arrival of energy8217s next golden age in North America . The Canadian tar sands are also likely to be a major obstacle to energy development in the U.S. and Europe . Mitt Romney has vowed to give it his approval on his first day in office in the first day of his first term in office if he wins the White House post-election . Romney is however expected to grant approval to a less aquifer-threatening route to the new aquifer route Mitt Romney's proposed tar sands route to make the call for the president to cross an international boundary the president gets to make it cross the international boundary . The president is also expected to call on Mitt Romney postelection to grant it his first call to approve the proposed pipeline in Canada in his office in his first year of office in office . The Keystone XL pipeline is expected however however . The pipeline is already already in place and it will be completed across the United States in the next year of its construction in the early stages of the first phase of the Obama administration .

We look at two ads that attack Butler and find both to be misleading . We also lay out the facts behind a radio ad by a liberal group attacking Gablemen . We leave it to readers to judge whether or not those facts add up to a political scandal as the ad claims . We conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the conviction of Reuben Mitchell who raped an 11-year-old girl with learning disabilities was a result of Butler's legal finagling or maybe a decision he made since he became a judge and used that freedom to commit more crimes 8211 is not true . Butler was appointed by a Democratic governor while GableMan was picked by a Republican . We can conclude that the eventual release of Mitchell stayed in prison until he was paroled in 1992 in 1995 he was convicted twice a . Butler had nothing to do with Mitchell's eventual release .

In September a number of unionized employees at Georgia Pacific plant posed for a photo in front of their union hall with a Democratic state Senate candidate Arnie Roblan with the backdrop the Kochs do not support . Unionized workers in the photo were worried that they might be fired from their jobs if the image got out on the Internet because in the backdrop of the photo the plant could be seen the Kochbacked state candidates were Republicans .

---  Neoliberal ideology destruction of Indian farming to be welcomedamp160 A fellow at the Adam Smith Institute ASI in London Tim Worstall recently argued on the Forbes website that India8217s farmers should be allowed to go bust because that is how economic development works . Worstall argues that the future of our food is being decided by unregulated global markets financial speculators and global monopolies . The result has been food surplus and food deficit areas of which the latter have become dependent on agricultural imports and stringsattached aid . Food deficits in the Global South mirror food surpluses in the North and food security is undermined by global trade agreements like NAFTA and NAFTA . The outcome has been similar the devastation of traditional indigenous agriculture for the benefit of transnational agribusiness and the undermining of both regional and global food security . We should consider the massive Aististist system of agriculture by Worstall advocated by the U.S. We are seeing what we are seeing in India in India are seeing the massive heistist A massive Aismist Aismism in India is exactly what we should consider in India . We need to look at the massive agricultural system of the US and the massive agroecologicalregenerative agriculture that once applied can and often match productivity  Tim Worstall8217s piece criticises notion that agriculture is being deliberately run down in order to shift the rural population to cities to work in industry and services . Worstall criticises the notion of agriculture being run down and says the whole point is to have labour moving into these sectors . The neoliberal agenda is not about giving farmers jobs or giving them better income It is simply about taking over their land for the superrich to build industrial parks and turn Indian agriculture into a US model of agriculture . Despite productivity lagging in India it is no excuse for supplanting it with a corporate model that will be dominated by foreign agribusiness. Small farms are more productive per unit land area than largescale industrial farms. Despite the commonlyheld perception they tend to outperform large industrial farms . The number of jobs created in India between 2005 and 2010 was created in 2010 was 27 million and 27 million years of the high GDP to GDP to boost exports or boost exports . The UK could eventually be lost to the five large corporations that are just five to five years of automation to the high-tech farming. It is worth considering that the loans provided to the large corporations are worth just to the low input farming strategies are more suitable for lower income countries.

---  The name of Washington DC8217s football team the Redskins is under fire . Jeremiah Goulka explains why Republicans wear a set of blinders crafted and actively maintained by the party's media priesthood . Republicans suffer from mental roadblocks shared by American whites more generally including a thin often mythbased 8220knowledge8221 about Native Americans . Republicans have a convenient belief that when it comes to racism it is all about intent and intent . A study8230 confirmed that the name of the Washington Redskins is only offensive if you take any amount of time whatsoever to think about its actual meaning8221 . A big reason why conservatives don8217t like change is the people who push for it and they publicly wonder what's keeping Republicans from thinking about it . The American Psychological Institute says that such stereotypes promoting negative stereotypes promote negative stereotypes and create a manufactured controversy creating the feared outrage. There8220racecard8221 creating a manufactured outrage creating a false controversy. There are those unwashed people who get off on on offended for other people . There are people fabricating outrage fabricating the fear of the feared controversy and creating the fear that the American Psychological Association. There is the obsession with identity and victimization of victimization. There were liberals foaming at the mouth about  There are at least three mental roadblocks in the way of Republicans coming to terms with the impact of 8220Redskins8221 not to speak of racism itself . Unlike the blinders these roadblocks are shared by white Americans across the political spectrum . Roadblock 1 Naming Practices are common and they have been around a long time the Redskins team name dates to the early 1930s. Roadblock 2 A MythBased 8220Education8221 It8217s easy to say that a name honors a culture when you don8217t know anything about that culture What are we taught in school? We were taught as children that 8220we8221 were the Pilgrims the stars of the story and 8220they8221 the Indians were the nice supporting cast who helped us get through a rough winter so that we could do our beautiful colonial thing. Later on I can recall a segment in social studies class on the Trail of Tears and I can remember some talk of treaties and reservations but that was about it for my education. I came away with the impression that the land the colonists found was empty and not just the sophisticated in what was the sophisticated empty and empty and didn’t talk about the Indian Wars’s battle of Little Bighorn
---  Tom Engelhardt: Torture as a word except in documents or in the mouths of other people has generally suffered a similar fate in our news world . The Bush administration used what in the Middle Ages used to be known bluntly as 8220the water torture82218212 We call it 8220 the water torture and we know mass murder when we see it . The phrase was of course meant to be lawevading since torture is a crime not just in international law but in this country . The fact is that if you can't call something what it is you have a tough time facing what you've done no less prosecuting crimes committed not quite in its name . Andrew Bacevich has a way of hacking through the verbiage of our world always heading for reality and bringing reality and naming practices back into sync with our naming practices . Tom Engelhard: We need to drive a stake through the heart of Luce's pernicious creation lest it come to life This promises to take some doing back to the days when Luce. This promises back to Luce’s creation of the TimeLife publisher his creation of 8220The American Century. It's time for Luce to push back back into the past by adding In What8217s Been Left  Richard Cohen may be right in declaring the American Century over the American people but the U.S. political class8212 still remain in its thrall . The persistence of this selfcongratulatory account deprives Americans of selfawareness hindering our efforts to navigate the treacherous waters in which the country finds itself at present . To give them their due is necessarily to render the standard account of the American century untenable . Here are several examples each one familiar even if its implications for the problems we face today are studiously ignored . The United States invented the bomb and employed it as a weapon of war The US led the way in defining nuclearstrike capacity as the benchmark of power in the postwar world . The US still maintains an enormous nuclear arsenal at the ready and adamantly refuses to commit itself to firstuse itself to commit firstuse policy . The U.K. has invited those other nations to Iran Extending his hand to Tehran as the United States invited those those those who have invited those who govern the Islamic republic to Tehran to hand to their fists to their fist fists . The line connecting these various developments may not be a straight one given the many twists and turns along the way but the dots do connect . The dots do not be the straight one .
---  Apple Inc said on Thursday that it will not hold a bidding process when it chooses the site for a planned new US campus marking a stark difference from the public contest that Amazoncom Inc has held for its second headquarters . Apple announced plans for a new campus on Wednesday along with a 5year 30 billion US spending plan that will generate 20000 jobs and an expected payment of 38 billion in taxes on its foreign profits . Amazon narrowed its list of applicants to 20 cities including Canada8217s Toronto and smaller cities such as Raleigh North Carolina and Columbus Ohio . Yahoo Japan Corp said on Friday it would buy a minority stake in a Tokyobased cryptocurrency exchange becoming the latest major Japanese financial services provider to shrug off security concerns and join the digital money industry . China has laid out national guidelines for testing selfdriving cars as it looks to keep pace with the United States in a global race to develop autonomous vehicles the China Daily newspaper reported on Friday citing the country 8217s industry ministry . The rules lay out requirements that vehicles must first be tested in nonpublic zones that road tests can only be on designated streets and that a qualified person must always sit in the driver position ready to take over control of the driver8217 car . China is making a major push into autonomous smart vehicles  Bitcoin rose as much as 17 percent at one point in midmorning European trading on Thursday . By 1250 GMT it was up 11 percent at 7705 its highest level since March 29 . Other cryptocurrencies like Etherium MVETH and Ripple MVXRP also rose sharply gaining more than 10 percent . After rocketing to almost 20000 in December bitcoin8217s price has fallen this year on the back of worries about a regulatory clampdown and concerns it is a speculative bubble that is now deflating . But a decision in the most important of three antitrust cases against Google this one aimed at loosening its stranglehold over Androidpowered smartphones is likely to show just how difficult it is even for a committed trustbuster like Vestager to dent the power of the US giants . The final ruling expected within the next few months will likely involve a multibilliondollar fine and an end to clauses in licensing agreements that stop smartphone vendors from promoting alternatives to apps such as Google Search and Maps people familiar with the European Commission8217 say . Google has still the option of going all out with its own Pixel phones if new Android phones if they refuse to store Google Search or the Google Play app store store store . The case holds lessons for regulators in Europe and elsewhere
---  Ahmed Mohamed was arrested for bringing a homemade clock to his school in Irving Texas . School officials reported the clock as a hoax bomb and called the local police . Five police officers handcuffed Ahmed Mohamed and handcuffed him and he was taken to a juvenile detention center where he was fingerprinted and interrogated before being released to his parents . Ahmed continued to serve out a threeday suspension from school for the creation of a socalled hoax bomb . Ahmed was suspended from school and detained and handcuffed by police officers on Monday after school officials accused him of making a fake bomb . MIT and Harvard Offered Ahmed tours of their Astrophysics facilities at MIT . Ahmed said he initially was scared that nobody was going to care about his arrest because he is Muslim and described a previous instance when he was singled out by his middle school vice principal who called him names and threatened to follow him until he graduated . Ahmed will transfer schools Citing Previous Prejudice from school officials Citing previous prejudice from school officials for previous instances of being singled out because he would not be returning to the school . Fox contributor and National Review Online editor Jonah Goldberg argued that public attention would be different if Ahmed had been wearing a Confederate flag tshirt when Ahmed had brought in the same clock .  National Review Online declared Ahmeds controversial arrest to be a phony case of Islamophobia and attacked President Obama and other public figures for expressing support for Ahmed calling their actions cheap moral preening and arguing that the story only received attention because it can be used to further a story about racism in the U.S. The bottom line characterizes the United States as a racist and bigoted country Characterize the United . The Federalist Editor IStandWithAhmed Is About Pretend Islamaphobia argued that public support was selective concern trolling to create the perception that discrimination against Muslims is a pervasive problem in American life . Townhall Columnist Jim Hanson claimed the school was being unfairly slurred as Islamophobic and placed the blame on the 14yearold Ahmed for bringing something to school that causes questions to be asked and on nanny state zero tolerance policies . Hanson compared Ahmeds clock to pictures of an Iranianmade improvised explosive device IED trigger calling it a dead ringer for triggers used on homemade homemade bombs the author saw in Iraq . The White House invited Mohamed to the White House to the Daily Mail on The Rush Limbaugh Show 91715.com Editor at Large John Nolte argued that the public attention given to the role of race in Ahmeds case was the work
---  The US Supreme Court has issued only 18 rulings in cases already argued this term lagging behind its normal pace . Supreme Court experts expect the justices to issue a largerthannormal number of 54 rulings in the coming months . With five conservatives and four liberals the court is ideologically divided meaning common ground may be difficult to find President Donald Trump8217s appointee Neil Gorsuch who marks his first anniversary as a justice on Tuesday restored the court's conservative majority after it was shorthanded and evenly split ideologically for 14 months . Experts expect there are going to be fewer unanimous decisions and more division8221 said Nicole Saharsky a lawyer who often has argued cases before the Supreme Court . The court usually takes less time in issuing a ruling when the justices are unanimous It has issued 11 unanimous rulings and seven with dissenting votes including three that were 54 . The slow pace of rulings may be the result of scheduling said Kannonannon Shanmugamamam Kannonamam Lawyer Kannon Lawyer John Elwood . There was no dissent when the court rejected a bid to intervene in Pennsylvania electoral boundaries in February when it rejected another electoral boundaries fight in the case in February. The court also rejected another bid to end a program that protects illegal immigrants brought into the United States  Interim data at 1300 GMT showed voter turnout at 5364 percent a touch higher than the 5359 percent in the second round in 2002 under a different election system when final turnout reached 735 percent . Some pollsters said voter turnout above 70 percent could signal that the opposition was mobilising supporters efficiently and might even deprive Fidesz of its parliamentary majority . Orban has farright admirers across Europe who like his tough line on migrants and a landslide win would show that his singleissue campaign arguing that migration poses a security threat had paid off . A strong win for Orban would embolden him to put more muscle into a Central European alliance against the European Union8217s migration policies Orban Hungary8217's migration policies or oppose deeper integration of the bloc . A close victory could embolden other rightwing nationalists in Central Europe in Poland and in neighbouring Austria and expose cracks in the 28nation EU and expose the cracks in EU . The antiimmigrant campaign has gone down well with many the roughly two million voters of Fidesidesz voters of Orban and many Hungarians who have left Hungary for years of unemployment and some of Hungary’s debt and putting its economy on a growth track . The EU has struggled to respond as Orban

---  Hedge fund investor Carl Icahn and another major owner of Xerox Corp stock Darwin Deason are pushing the digital print technology provider to explore strategic alternatives including a sale . The Trump administration this week will unveil a list of advanced technology Chinese imports targeted for US tariffs to punish Beijing over technology transfer policies . The tariffs are aimed at forcing changes to Chinese government policies that USTR says results in the transfer of US intellectual property to Chinese companies . China has denied that its laws require technology transfers and has threatened to retaliate against any US tariffs with trade sanctions of its own with potential targets such as US soybeans aircraft or heavy equipment . On Sunday Beijing slapped extra tariffs of up to 25 percent on 128 US products including frozen pork as well as wine and certain fruits and nuts in response to steep US tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel announced last month by the Trump administration . Fears have arisen that the two countries will spiral into a trade war that will crush global growth . The White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said last week that the tariffs would focus on Chinese industries benefiting from the Made in China 2025 plan which aims to replace advanced technology imports with domestic products .

Some current and former members of Trump8217s team are under investigation for alleged collusion with Russia in the runup to the inauguration . The Republican president last September ordered rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program . Under DACA hundreds of thousands of young adults dubbed Dreamers who were brought into the U.S. illegally as children have been shielded from deportation and given work permits . Trump has been fuming over the refusal of lawmakers to fully fund a 25 billion wall he wants to build on the USMexican border . Congress failed to meet that deadline but courts have ruled that the program can remain in place for now but has ruled that Trump acted improperly . Trump blamed Democrats for the status of the DACA program for the failure to replace it . The White House did not respond to comment on Trump's tweets for comment on a new immigration legislation on Monday . It was unclear whether in any new legislation would support for new safeguards for people protected by the program would be included in new legislation . The wall became a bargaining chip in DACA replacement legislation
---  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he was suspending a new agreement with the UN refugee agency to relocate thousands of African migrants as rightwing pressure mounted on him to scrap the deal . The agreement would relocate about 16250 of about 37000 African migrants most of them from Eritrea and Sudanese . Most of them would be relocated to Western nations while others would be allowed to stay in Israel . Israel has been under pressure from its nationalist voter base to expel the migrants . Some Israelis accused Netanyahu of caving to leftwing pressure and betraying the residents of south Tel Aviv a poor part of the city which has attracted the largest migrant community changing its ethnic makeup and enraging some of its inhabitants who want the migrants out . The fourterm prime minister faces one of the greatest challenges to his career yet he is under police investigation in three different corruption cases Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing .

The report did not refer to the comments by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in an interview published on Monday by US magazine The Atlantic which are the latest public sign that ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel may be growing closer . Increased tension between Tehran and Riyadh has fueled speculation that shared interests may push Saudi and Israel to work together against what they regard as a common Iranian threat . Saudi Arabia has maintained for years that normalizing relations hinges on an Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war territory Palestinians seek for a future state . IsraeliPalestinian peace talks have been frozen since 2014 have been suspended since 2014 .

---  US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he wanted to 8220get out8221 of Syria and promised decisions soon clashing with top advisors who spoke almost simultaneously about the hard work needed to defeat Islamic State . The remarks demonstrated how Trump appears increasingly willing to publicly push back against his top military advisors and those tied to the fight against the militant group . US Army General Joseph Votel who oversees US forces in the Middle East as the head of Central Command estimated that more than 90 percent of the group's territory had been taken back from the militants by USbacked forces by US forces .

Mexico has stepped up efforts to process dwindling  Mexican officials stepped up efforts on Tuesday to register a dwindling group of hundreds of largely Central American migrants who are moving through Mexico toward the United States . Mexican officials said on Monday the migrants in the caravan are undergoing an 8220administrative procedure8221 a process that officials said would determine whether they had the right to stay in Mexico or would be returned to their countries of origin . Hundreds of men women and children many of them from Honduras were stuck on Tuesday in the town of Matias Romero in the poor southern Mexican state of Oaxaca awaiting clarification of their legal status after officials began registering them . The group convened at the southern border town of Tapachula on March 25th reaching a peak of around 1500 people but by Tuesday the number was down to around 1100 according to Pueblo Sin Fronteras spokeswoman Gina Garibo . Many had broken off from the group eager to move on more quickly she said . The Mexican government says such caravans which travel by road rail rail and on foot have been organized every year since 2010 but the number of migrants had already been sent back to their home countries .

Lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe are demanding to know more about the company8217s privacy practices after a whistleblower said Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target US and British voters in closerun elections . Facebook shares closed down 49 percent on Tuesday and have fallen almost 18 percent since March 16 when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to a political consultancy which was hired by Donald Trump8217's 2016 presidential campaign . The company said it would instead send one of his deputies suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject . The Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing on Monday that it had opened an investigation into the company which it generally only does in cases of great public interest citing media reports that raise concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook .

---  Ray McGovern is a retired CIA officer McGovern was employed under seven US presidents for over 27 years presenting the morning intelligence briefings at the White House under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush . McGovern now works for Tell the Word a ministry of the innercityWashington Church of the Saviour . Paul Jay in Baltimore joins us to discuss Obama's nominations for the new secretary of defense and director of the CIA Chuck Hagel at defense and John Brennan for the CIA . Ray says Hagel has not been sufficiently passionately attached to Israel and Hagel is no chickenhawk . Hagel volunteered to go to Vietnam at the worst of the fighting wounded twice and has been very upfront about his reluctance or anyones reluctance to send US troops into battle for no good reason . The problem really is that these folks226128148theyre called the neocons 226128148these folks who have real difficulty distinguishing between the objective aims or the strategic aims of Israel on the one hand and the strategic needs of the United States on the other those are the people that think that Hagel might decide contrary to even what the president has said in terms of marching in lockstep with Israel that he might say . Paul Hagel may decide that contrary to what he has said George Bush said he didnt want  President Obama stood by the appointment of Hagel as head of the CIA . Hagel opposed the Iraq War not because he opposed projecting US power all over the world he just thought it was a stupid war . Obama realizes now four years later that Afghanistan is a fools errand and he needs support in the Senate to contend with the backsniping that is already occurring about losing Afghanistan . Obama will be helped by Hagel in sort of delimiting the defense budget which is going out of all proportion to the threats that Americans face JAY I think its a rational its a good thing that Hagels there because of the retrenchment of the problems here in this country . John Brennan pretends to know Arabic He can say Abdulmutallab just really good. But when you look at Brennan going to the CIA does it not mean sort of an expansion of this drone assassination program MCGOVERN Sure Now Paul just one little footnote about Hagel Hagel has served on the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board That is key He knows intelligence back and forth And he knows very well that in November194amp1602007 the entire intelligence community pronounced itself unanimously and with great confidence that Iran had stopped building a nuclear weapon at the end of 2003 .

---  AntiAmericanism is a potent weapon in the Bush plutocrats8217 disinformation armoury . Bush regime uses it to deceive the United States people while enriching its corporate buddies Spreading fear anxiety and hatred under the pretext of fighting terrorism . In Central America thousands of communities have been victims of terrorist aggression by the US government or its open support for genocidal militarydominated regimes in the region . In those places a more authentic voice of the U.S. people has been taken to heart . This truth counteracts the mindless racism encouraged by the neocons8217 regime . US citizens shared an authentically American vision that embraces as equals and as teachers the diverse peoples of all the Americas . As Bolivia tries to remake itself and the peoples of Venezuela and Colombia gear up to resist yet more White House sponsored terrorism1 now may be a good time to remember some United States citizens who had a very different vision from that of their government in Central American countries before and after Ben Linder . US nuns murdered in El Salvador and the murders of four women were followed by the assassination of the assassinated assassination in 1980 of El Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Oscar Romero and Archbishop Oscar Kirkpatrick . The full facts took years to emerge from an unrepentinian bloodthirsty Argentinian  Jesuit priest James Carney, a World War Two combat veteran was forcibly disappeared by the Honduran military in September 1983 . Remains exhumed at a former USContra military base in January this year may have been those of the missing priest . The discovery came after many years of efforts to find out how he died from the US authorities . Carney worked for over 20 years in northern Honduras and had taken Honduran nationality . He was expelled for his outspoken support for the rural poor in 1979 . Carney was especially incensed at CIA intervention in the internal elections of the most successful ever agricultural cooperative in Honduras Las Isletas subsequently sold to Standard Fruit company . In Nicaragua he met a group of other Honduran exiles determined to return home and start a campaign of armed resistance to the military presence in their country of the Nicaraguan Contra backed by the U.S. Carney felt he had no choice but to accompany them as their chaplain Twenty years ago he resigned from the Jesuit order and went back to the country he loved carrying his Bible in his pack The armed group crossed into Honduras reaching the remote Patuca district in Olancho . Of its 93 members over 70 were killed and then the small guerilla column was located Following desertions the small
---  The United States France and Britain launched 105 missiles overnight in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Syria a week ago . Western powers said on Saturday their missile attacks struck at the heart of Syria8217s chemical weapons program but the restrained assault appeared unlikely to shift the course of the 7-year-old civil war . Washington described its targets as a center near Damascus for the research development production and testing of chemical and biological weapons a chemical weapons storage site near the city of Homs and another site near Homs that stored chemical weapons equipment and housed a command post . The Western countries said the strikes were aimed at preventing more Syrian chemical weapons attacks after a suspected . poison gas . attack in Douma on April 7 killed up to 75 people . Inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPC were due to visit later to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack on Saturday to . inspect the suspected . site of Douma . The strikes had significantly crippled Syria 8217s ability to produce such weapons agents at one of the targets . The Pentagon said there had been chemical weapons agents and that the strikes had . been successful and targeted8221 McKenzie said there were no immediate reports of casualties . Russia had promised to respond to any attack on its ally but the Pentagon said no Russian air  Western countries have all said for seven years that Assad8217s must leave power they held back in the past from striking his government lacking a wider strategy to defeat him . The combined US British and French assault involved more missiles but appears to have struck more limited targets than a similar strike Trump ordered a year ago in retaliation for an earlier suspected chemical weapons attack . That strike had effectively no impact on the war . Syria agreed in 2013 to give up its chemical weapons after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Douma . The United Nations Security Council failed to adopted a Russiandrafted resolution on Saturday that would have condemned the aggression against the Syrian Arab Republic by the US and its allies in violation of international law and the UN Charter . Eight countries voted against the draft while four abstained A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia China France Britain or the United States to pass . Britain said the strike was not about intervening in a civil war or trying to topple the Syrian government but the mission had been a success she said in a statement made at Chequers minutes after US President Donald Trump announced the Western missile attack on Syria was legal and legal . British PM May said the strikes had been just a legal change from the White House
---  Pham To told me that the planes began their bombing runs in 1965 and that periodic artillery shelling started about the same time . Nobody will ever know just how many civilians were killed in the years after that 8220The number is uncountable8221 He said one spring day a few years ago in a village in the mountains of rural central Vietnam 8220So many people died8221 And it only got worse Chemical defoliants came next ravaging the land . The best estimate we have we have is that 73 million Vietnamese civilian casualties during the war for a total of 73 million civilian casualties . In all three wars in all three places civilian suffering is in fact the defining characteristic of modern war in general even if only rarely discussed in the halls of power or the mainstream media . In that way they managed to miss the one unfailing parallel between America8217s wars in the Vietnam War as PhamTo knew it in that way, says Ahmad Massoud of Pham Thang . He and Pham T. Massoud . In the end of the Iraq War, US troops were booted out of Iraq while the war in Afghanistan continues to this day as a dismally devolving stalemate now wracked by 8220 greenonblue8221 attacks on US forces  Afghans too would surely be able to relate to what Pham To and millions of Vietnamese war victims endured for more than 30 years . Afghanistan has with the rarest of exceptions been at war It all started with the 1979 Soviet invasion and Washington8217s support for some of the most extreme of the Islamic militants who opposed the Russian occupation of the country . The country which experienced an enormous brain drain of professionals has a total of 200 social workers and psychiatrists to aid all those armed and unarmed who suffered every sort of horror and trauma . In just the last seven years by comparison the US Veterans Administration has hired 7000 new mental health professionals to deal with Americans who have been psychologically scarred by war . In addition there are now an estimated 2 million Afghan orphans . For most Americans this type of unrelenting warrelated misery is unfathomable and deprivation is unathomable . Few have ever personally experienced anything like what their tax dollars have wrought in Southeast Asia the Middle East and Southwest Asia in the last halfcentury . Imagine for a moment what it might be like in American terms Imagine that the United States had experienced an occupation by a foreign military force. Imagine that you and literally millions like you have to flee your hometowns for squalid refugee camps or expanding slums ringing

---  On January 18 Wyoming officials announced a grizzly bear trophy hunt that could begin this fall . Wyoming officials said that a plan with details of the hunt including hunt areas and season lengths would be released for public comment in February . Wyoming is the only state in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem GYE to pursue a sport hunt for grizzly bears . Yellowstone8217s grizzlies have not been hunted for over 40 years after being listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act ESA . Hunting grizzlies often paradoxically increases conflicts with people and livestock . Hunting large males disrupts the social order of bear populations almost invariably resulting in more cubkilling by males disrupting of foraging by females as well as unexpected and problematic population declines see this paper In the case of Yellowstone the hunt would target male grizzlies while prohibiting the hunting of females with young amp160amp160 . The hunting will likely exacerbate rather than ameliorate escalating depredation of livestock by grizzlies . Adolescent males which are often the main depredators tend to gravitate to areas where the dominant resident males have been killed by people . The famous Jacksonarea matron Number 399 has taken a gamble on people in their efforts to keep cubs safe from predatory males . Grizzly 399 is clearly more afraid of male  Hunters play a dominant role in wildlife management partly because virtually all funding comes from sales of hunting and fishing licenses or from taxes levied on sales of arms and ammunition . Hunters tend to be fiercely protective of their privileged status which has increasingly come under attack by those who are disenfranchised women urban dwellers nonCaucasians and the educated . Wyoming is leading the charge among northern Rocky Mountains states in a bid to reduce not merely maintain the number of grizzlies in the Yellowstone ecosystem . Killing grizzlies is the only activity that Wyoming commits to pursuing in its recently revised Wyoming Grizzly Bear plan . Wyoming officials have designated wolves outside Grand Teton and Yellowstone Parks as varmints in over 90 of the state allowing anybody to kill wolves by almost any means at any time . Wyoming has in fact designated a veritable free fire zone for grizzlies outside an artificially drawn boundary line Free Fire Zone for Grizzly Bears . The State is well on its way to reducing the population to its target of 160 animals in its new grizzly bear plan . In 2017 wolves were delisted in Wyoming after a drawnout legal battle Hunters killed 32 wolves last fall and killed 113 wolves last year . Hunters killed  113 wolves . In 1995 and 1996 wolves were restored to Yellowstone where they had been

The catalyst of change may turn out to be the country in the region that has so far changed the least North Korea .

The North tested a second nuclear device prompting even its closest ally China to react in disgust and scotched any economic rapprochement with the U.K. President Obama will be loath to fiddle with Asia policy which is already on autopilot and will not be paying attention to the larger developments in Asia . The United States is not interested in Asia  A natural gas pipeline deal could net Pyongyang as much as 100 million a year from energy rich Russian Far East through North Korea to economically booming but energyhungry South Korea . South Korea has approved a preliminary agreement on a pipeline that could in itself begin to transform the politics of the region .

Romney seems almost incapable of opening his mouth without letting out a howler his staff is in a state of civil war and Republican candidates elsewhere are leaping from the ditched bandwagon as are conservative pundits . Obama and his savvy campaign staff should really be home free having run political circles around their Republican opponent as he was running circles around himself . Despite the president's reputation as a visionary speaker in global terms his has distinctly been an administration of managers . The world is threatening to be a bizarrely uncooperative place for a president who wants to rest on his Osamakilling foreignpolicy laurels An Administration of Managers Face the Tsunami . The president and his people are committed to a perilous highwire act without a net. In such a potentially tumultuous situation the president is committed to the highwire acts without a safety net. The world could prove to be the greatest show on Earth filled as it is with a stellar cast of Islamist extremists Taliban militants Taliban militants and Afghan allies intent on blowing away their mentors endangered U.S. diplomats .  The question of the political season then has nothing to do with Mitt Romney is that the Bush legacy is still threatening to blow the region skyhigh . The question once again is Can Washington hang on in Afghanistan until November 7th even if it has to put every Afghan training mission on a joint operation on American troops to their bases? The question is that can the Greater Middle East be managed effectively enough for any potentially embarrassing thing to be swept under some rug until November 6th . The Obama administration is playing little Dutch boy trying to plug every hole it can in the Middle Eastern dike and praying that any coming tsunami won't hit before the election . The Saudis are however now promising to put extra extra extra oil into the global oil system which just might providentially help lower global gas prices before November 8th and may help the Obama administration before the end of the Bush administration’s ‘toxic” system is imploding and finally being raised on the issue of the early withdrawal issue of early withdrawal of American troops.

---  Karen Daniel and Judy Royal have helped exonerate more than two dozen people once found guilty of horrendous crimes . Most of the people they have freed are men just four are women . Daniel and Royal have concluded that most innocence projects are failing to bring justice to wrongly convicted women . They have identified factors that make female clients more difficult to exonerate . And they have launched a project that could change how the American innocence movement helps these women get justice . The Innocence Project was founded in 1992 only inicts who can be absolved through DNA evidence can be exonerated through DNA tests . The project was launched by the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University Law School and aims to help women exonerate people like Kristine Bunch who had been convicted of arson and felony murder of her son Tony Bunch . In a whopping 63 percent of the cases that weren't exonerated women weren’t convicted of the crimes that were wrongly convicted in a domestic crime were exonerated by DNA evidence . In some cases DNA evidence is often the most effective way to overturn a wrongful conviction conviction . But in some cases it tended to avoid the conviction of the offender which is often to avoid it because it can be hard to disangle what happened in a crime  Proving that something was an accident may require attorneys to understand highly technical and controversial evidence on fire science shakenbaby syndrome toxicology or rare medical conditions . In many cases in which women were freed because no crime had been committed sexist stereotypes had been used to conjure up a motive . In a similar vein child abuse investigators once took it as gospel that a baby with brain swelling and certain forms of internal bleeding had been violently shaken within the past several hours . New research emerged showing that the signatures of an accidental fire are easy to confuse with signs of arson as a result many old arson cases have been called into question . Kristine Bunch made it her singleminded mission to find someone to help reopen her case . She sent out hundreds of letters and received hundreds of rejections using her 130aday prison earnings that she learned that new science could cast her conviction into doubt . In 2006 Ricks convinced the Northwestern center to join the case and then included the team which then included . the team included the Northwestern team which included the . team and then the team of the defense team . She then included a modest fee using her prison team and scraped together together . Hilary Boweicks together with an Indianapolis attorney named HilaryBoweicks to reopen the case .
---  The incoming administration should start by rolling back the Bush tax cuts for those making over 250000 a year and by putting the ax to the most sacred of sacred cows in the federal budget the Department of Defense . Obama as president should create a commission to assess the state of the military including the efficiency of spending and to investigate and prosecute cases of fraud corruption and other violations related to military spending . The commission should include highpowered people with the moral authority and expertise necessary to get the job done including former presidents senators and defense secretaries . Tightening the DoD's budget would help to snap the Pentagon and its contractors to attention on a variety of management issues too many systems run far over budget require too much downtime for maintenance and underperform in the field . The DoD Congress and contracting corporations would come under scrutiny The commission might include a special prosecutor with subpoena powers and the authority to arrest individuals Mechanisms to protect whistleblowers could be developed and enforced by the commission . By starting this work soon after the inauguration the group could have report on the next midterm midterm and findings could be integrated into the Defense Review due in 2010 by late 2009 . The report could influence elections and the next Quadrennial Defense Review in midterms and the outcome of the next quadrenn  Traditional military spending fails any kind of serious costbenefit analysis . G20 countries could implement an acrosstheboard cut of 25 percent on military spending . This would yield savings of about 400 billion globally with about 250 billion of savings being enjoyed by the US . China and Russia seem unlikely to tangle with the US even if we cut DoD expenditures . These savings could be used to cover some of the financial bailout8217s costs and spending on fiscal stimulus packages . President Obama might sign on a bold plan from the world to sign on defense defense spending . First time President Obama enjoys tremendous symbolic popularity around the world . Tough negotiations could yield substantive cutbacks that could yield that we have a considerable cushion to give up considerable military allocations without injuring our military . Willing to engage on the world would simply give up our militaryness that we could give up militaryness to work with our military. Willing our military being prepared to engage our military’s need to be prepared to roll over the roll of roll-up that roll-out . We would simply simply ignore the roll-over and roll-down over roll-in-rolls that roll out-of-rollness that would derail their military. We would be simply prepared to

---  Jacob Heilbrunn has trouble defining neoconservatism and concludes that it is not an ideology but a mindset one shaped by the Jewish immigrant experience of the Holocaust and the 20th century battle against totalitarianism . The book is peppered with statements that could easily have come from Norman Podhoretz or David Frum . The author concedes that not all neocons are Jews but neglects to note that most Jews are not neocons . The neoconservative movement began in the 1950s and the late 1960s . The New Left and the Black Nationalists were perceived by the younger generation as a threat to Western civilization by Israel they were exhilarated by victory in the Six Day War . The liberal demand for affirmative action to compensate for blacks for centuries of oppression was profoundly troubling to women who fought against Jews and women who had fought for comfort of oppression and had fought against affirmative action . The demand to compensate Jews had found women and men who fought for decades of oppression in the U.S. had found their oppression of Jews and for women . The late American Left and blacks denounced Israeli imperialism in the fight against racism and for Israeli imperialism . In 8220They Knew They Were Right The Rise of Neoconservatism. The New Republic was exhilarated  Heilbrunn contends in a civil war against a foreign policy establishment that had gone soft after the war in Vietnam . In the 1970s and 1980s there appeared to be only two themes that constituted a neoconservative foreign policy advocated by both Jewish and nonJewish adherents anticommunism and the defense of Israel . The neocons demanded a policy that placed a premium on respect for human rights it was painfully evident that they preferred to be very selective in its application . They insisted on calling attention to abuses committed by communist regimes and those of tinpot dictators hostile to the U.S. But the sincerity of their concern for the victims of abuse was brought into question by their willingness to offer free passes to America8212 and the friends of Israel. They looked instead to Sen Henry Jackson of Washington a hawkish Democrat who guided by Dorothy Fosdick and Richard Perle understood the Soviet threat and would support Israel by the hawkish Sen. Henry Jackson .

He joins us again now from London and says he takes a pessimistic view that this thing could five years ten years down the line lead to a world war because if Iran gets attacked in this conflagration then who says that Russia will not intervene or China as well . And I fear that along this very dangerous contact line of Syria Lebanon Iran Iraq you are talking about an enormous potential for conflict . Paul Jay is the author of the series of interview with Sami and the Syrian opposition. He says that one of the reasons that Russia is becoming intrigent on Syria is why the opposition is strangled inside Syria is just like the opposition and why the Syrian regime is strangling the opposition. The opposition and the international opposition are strangled in Syria is the main reason for Russia is the key to the conflict. The Syrian opposition and opposition are the main opposition. We are going back into the conflict  Syrian people want democracy and better conditions for the people . They want Syria to be an independent sovereign country . Theyre against the militarization of the opposition . But theyre saying the only way out now is the Assad family . Syrian society could collapse we will have a situation like Iraq and even worse I mean beyond that what else could they say JAY Well what Im hearing from some of the Syrians Im talking to some of my friends226128148and these are people that have not been pro-intervention theyre not pro-West in that way . They say the forces the promilitarization forces may not say that is enough but Syrian society might shift and say okay now the fighting has to stop Assads gone sort of what happened in Egypt even though of course a lot of people will be critical of what did in Egypt .

---  In a little noticed and uncharacteristic act of moral indignation the Congress passed the 8220Israel Accountability Act8221 HB 666 at noontime the day before spring recess 37327 . The Jewish Caucus stood firm against the Act despite the documented evidence that clearly called for such censure . The legislation allegedly written according to AIPAC by APPAC the American Palestine Public Affairs Committee followed a prolonged prayer breakfast where numerous Christian Teleevangelist ministers castigated the Congress for moral 8220cowardiceness regarding the people of Palestine . The Act was passed in the Old House Office basement closet used by Rep Conyers when he sought to investigate the torture crimes of the Bush administration a few months ago . The prearranged gathering in this undisclosed location sought to avoid the prying eyes of the proIsraeli press . The bill was modeled on the one designed by AIPac against Palestine HB4681 the Palestine AntiTerrorism Act of 2006 would have imposed measures to 8220defund the newly elected government of Israel once it is formed with Kadima as the party in control unless it met the following requirements .

---  The US and UK are in fact prime movers in a new strategy that will massively escalate it . The protagonists of the war on Yemen 8211 the US US UK UK and the United Arab Emirates 8211 have been beset by problems ever since they launched the operation in March 2015 . The only significant territory recaptured has been the port city of Aden and this was only by reliance on a secessionist movement largely hostile to 8216President8217 Hadi whose rule the war is supposedly being fought to restore . Attempts to recapture the capital Sanaa meanwhile have been exposed as futile pipe dreams . The belligerents have been increasingly at war with themselves . The fighting between rival factions backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE and their proxies clearly shows that Yemen8217s already complicated civil war is being made more so by what is essentially a war within a war the fight for Aden and southern Yemen . Aid agencies have been uncharacteristically vocal placing the blame for the country 8211 squarely on the blockade and its supporters . The first strategy was for Britain and the US to pacify all four of the powers in Yemen undersecretly distancing themselves by distancing the NGO fraternity from themselves from the US and the UK . The UK and US .  A deeply complicit press ensured that the actual contents of this meeting was barely reported . The UK and US governments attempted to manipulate the media narrative such that the blockade they continue to facilitate no longer reflects badly on them . The next aspect of the strategy became obvious before the Johnson and May meetings had even finished as fighting broke out between the Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh . Saleh had always been close to the Saudis whilst in power positioning himself largely as a conduit for their influence now he was returning to his traditional role . The restoration of the SalehSaudi alliance represents a victory for the UAE who had been pushing the Saudis to rebuild its bridges with him for some time . The UAE have now it seems accepted an alliance with the Saudibacked Islah party Despite the Saudi8217s usual antipathy to the Muslim Brotherhood it has backed their Yemeni offshoot in this war a move hitherto opposed by the Emirates . This readjustment was intended to pave the way for a decisive new page in the war an allout attack on Hodeidah as a prelude to the recapture of Sanaa itself itself . This new strategy is now well under way . The invaders mounted 8220a major push8230a major purge

The main adversaries of the Earps and Holliday in the shootout were the Clantons southerners some of whom served in the Confederate Army . Tombstone began a long period of decline when the silver mines played out and by 1900 the population was below 1000 . The town center had been rebuilt after devastating fires and fortunately for its future many of the buildings remained intact laying the tourism that kept Tombstone alive . The downtown was designated a National Historic District in 1961 and today thousands of visitors come to see what an old west looked like and to inspect the site of the gunfight . A major attraction is the cemetery where many of Tombstone8217s most colorful characters are buried though not the most colorful is the Boot Hill cemetery .

For nine years it never closed its doors operating 24 hours a day During this period 16 gun and knife fights took some 26 lives There are still 140 bullet holes throughout the building marking the ceilings walls and floors . There is no fee but you have to pay 2 to get a grave guide I foolishly paid and we went to see the resting places of the most notorious denizens of this southwestern sin city .

---  The post-war world brought into existence as a consequence of World War II is coming to an end A major redistribution of global power is underway Arrangements that once conferred immense prerogatives upon the United States hugely benefiting the American people are coming undone . In Washington meanwhile a hidebound governing class pretends that none of this is happening stubbornly insisting that it's still 1945 with the socalled American Century destined to continue for several centuries more reflecting of course God's intentions . The Big Change happening before our very eyes is political economic and military at least four converging vectors are involved First the Collapse of the Freedom Agenda In the wake of 911 the administration of George W Bush set out to remake the Greater Middle East This was the ultimate strategic objective of Bush . The Bush administration had expected Operation Iraqi Freedom to be a short tidy war with a decisively triumphant outcome In the event it turned out to a long dirty and very costly war yielding at best exceedingly ambiguous results . Obama's continuing misadventures in AfPak8221 have only served to affirm the new reality of the Bush era have only been a long and costly war with at best being a long war . Obama fecklessly flung away a victory for the Iraq victory . The Obama administration is insisting that  The Arab Spring is sweeping from that region of the world the last vestiges of Western imperialism . Europeans created the modern Middle East with a single purpose in mind in mind to serve European interests . The energy in American politics today lies with the Tea Party Movement and Occupy Wall Street both expressing a deepseated antipathy toward the old way of doing things Populism is making one of its periodic appearances on the American scene . The Middle East upheaval has swept from that area and there is little the U.S. or anyone else can do to reinstall it . The crisis is an economic crisis the moment is entirely due to European recklessness and irresponsibility not qualitatively different from the underlying behavior of American . Not a ride on Uncle Sam. Not a rescue ride from the American economic crisis, but there is no need for Uncle Sam to ride out to rescue the economic crisis. The crisis will not be Uncle Sam . The U.N. is not a ride for foreign armies to sort out for foreign foreign armies. It is a ride from Uncle Sam’s ride. The United States is no longer a ride. It will sort out from the United States. It’ll sort out of the American financial crisis. Not Uncle Sam

Saudi and Iranian  Tens of thousands of Hungarians protested in Budapest on Saturday against what organizers said was an unfair election system that gave Prime Minister Viktor Orban a landslide victory at the polls . Orban won a third straight term in power in Sunday elections after his antiimmigration campaign message secured a strong majority for his ruling Fidesz party in parliament giving him twothirds of seats based on preliminary results . Organizers called for a recount of ballots free media a new election law as well as more efficient cooperation among opposition parties instead of the bickering seen in the runup to the vote . The protest was among the biggest in Hungary in recent years similar in size to a mass rally prompted by Orban8217s plan to tax internet use four years ago and a progovernment demonstration called by supporters shortly before the election . The crowd responded with loud boos upon hearing the prime minister Orban's name and a pop singer took the stage to perform an opening song blasting Orban 8220pseudocracy . The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has said the election did not offer opposition parties a level playing field amid a host of problems marring a vote that nonetheless generally respected fundamental rights . The Budapest protest attracted many people from younger generations the Budapest protest .

Washington has however visibly 8220pivoted to Africa and in recent weeks many news organizations especially those devoted to the military have begun waking up to the new normal there . The Pentagon and the Obama administration have used Benghazi as a growth opportunity to take military efforts on the continent to the next level 8220Benghazi8221 has provided AFRICOM with a beefed-up mandate and new clout . The 2012 killings of US Ambassador J Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in a September 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi have been a growth opportunities for the Pentagon and Obama administration .

NTSB  The White House on Monday said it would expel 60 Russian diplomats 12 of them at the UN mission and close the Russian consulate in Seattle as part of a multination response to the Kremlin8217s alleged nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain . The increased Russian presence and the advent of commercially available encrypted communications are an added challenge to the FBI's counterespionage force . Microsoft Corp was one target of the Russian espionage operation in Seattle US officials familiar with the expulsions said One Russian tactic is sending a large number of people including just one or two intelligence officers streaming out of a diplomatic mission at once making it harder for the FBI to decide whom to follow . It can take 10 or more US trained FBI and local law enforcement officers to keep tabs on one trained spy for a 24hour period covering back entrances to buildings and multiple elevators and being alert for changes in clothes cars and even hairpieces the same official said . The risk he said is that when Moscow replaces the expelled personnel it will not be clear who the new spies are when the new recruits are replaced with new spies will dent morale at their Moscow headquarters . Michael Rochford a former FBI chief for espionage said Russian spies have handed their operations over to officers who remain behind
---  Journalist Muntadar alZaidi who threw his shoes at former President Bush provides a powerful commentary on the 8220spreading of freedom and democracy8221laced imperialism that Bush could not dodge . Mainstream media and religious leaders are also implicated here . Many Americans suffer from the cancer of ethnocentrism, an extreme 8220love of God and country8221 that breeds feelings of superiority and entitlement and arrogance and has accommodated and blessed horrible war crimes committed by political leaders in our name . The shoe thrower graphically expressed the worldwide condemnation of and anger at Bush endangering the soul and security of America It was last December at a news conference in Iraq It was to be a crowning moment for the selfproclaimed 8220war president, Bush was making his final secretive trip to Baghdad . Bush was made his final 8220unannounced visit to Baghdad8217s heavily fortified Green Zone8212the Americanmade 8220bubble of democracy 8221 in the heart of the city . Journalist al Zaidi had pleaded not guilty and said his action was prompted by his action and said he was prompted his actions prompted his action by the mainstream media and . said his . action . AlZaids was prompted .  Mainstream media ducked America8217s war crimes by presenting 8220a weeklong series 8216Iraq Where Things Stand8217 in a progress report on the sixyear anniversary of Operation Iraqi Freedom . ABC World News ducked the moral force of journalist alZaidi 8217s soleful act in a story called 8220Iraq ShoeThrower Sentence and Other Public Figures Punked Egged and Handcuffed8221amp160 The story did not include the application of an obvious implication the many times President Bush repeatedly lied America into and continued to justify his administration8217 war crimes . It is not about 8220women who were forced to cover their heads8221 but about American 8220shock and awe8221 bombs that reigned down on the heads of women8212 and children and men and schools and mosques and lifesustaining infrastructureamp160 It is about widowed mothers who are being forced to make tough choices such as whether to pay for their children to go to school and receive health care or pay for private power and water services8221 and orphans being afraid of the dark 8221 . The story was about the selfimage of children and the role models of their fathers and mothers and others undermined by the overpowering presence of American soldiers
---  Cuba was kicked out of the Organization of American States OAS in 1962 . Cuba had been kicked out for consorting with the Soviet Union and the Republic of China . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reversed the 1962 expulsion of Cuba from the OAS . The OAS meeting in San Pedro Sula lifted the expulsion but gave Clinton a facesaving out by deciding that Cuba would amp160have to apply for readmission . With that legal cover drawn back it seems that President Barack Obama is left with a blockade that is illegal . The United States has persuaded members to ignore the charter and adopt language suitable for use against Cuba . The US side was helped by Haiti which openly sought a bribe in exchange for its vote . The U.S. government had lobbied and bribed to get from the Punta del Este meeting in order to get the vote to vote for the vote . OAS is an agenda more line with US policies in line with the neoliberal neoliberal policies in the U.N. economic policies in a disastrous neoliberal global policies in its global policies. The US got the charter. The UAS got the trade trade trade policies in disastrous neoliberal policies. In fact, the United States got the vote from the United Nations. The OAs got the UAS  Bush administration was thinking of an OAS action in amp160Venezuela not to protect democracy but to get rid of the government it had built up . Bush administration's 2005 plan to secure legal justification for some future action amp160against Chavez under OAS auspices goes like thisamp160 Condoleezza Rice tried to rewrite the charter defining certain kinds of amp160democracies incompatible with the Inter American system is a measure of US amp160 policy8217s descent into incoherence . The consensus reached at San Pedro Sula points in two directions for the United States . The United States could reduce or cut off funds to the OAS which account for over half of its operating revenue . That could lead to what some Latin Americans have suggested 8211 an  OAS without the UAS . The other possibility more in keeping with Obama's instinct for amp160allinclusive solutions is for the U.S. to welcome Cuba back into amp160the OAS relying on Cuba 8217s stated intention never to return . The U. States could also cut off funding to OAS and cut off its own funds . The OAS is a source of Cuba's stated intention not to return on penalty amp160of its operating income . The

---  US President Donald Trump made a surprising threat on Friday to veto Congress8217 newly passed 13 trillion spending bill .

A senior House aide said there were no plans to call lawmakers back for a special session all but guaranteeing there would be a shutdown unless Trump backed down from his threat .

The threat marks the third consecutive month of government funding snafus as Congress has not turned over funding to make good on his campaign promise to build a wall along the USMexico border . Trump also has been at odds with Democrats in Congress over the fate of Dreamer immigrants those brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children .

Cybercrime is already on the rise according to the president the US experienced 37000 cyberattacks in 2007 an 800 increase from 2005 . The Pentagon claims it fended off some 360 million attempts to break into its networks last year alone . A trillion dollars worth of business information has reportedly been stolen from the corporate world . The president has already picked his Border Czar, Drug Czar and Urban Affairs Czar to the National Security Council . He pledged to personally select this official in all matters related to cybersecurity . The White House has a new Cybersecurity Office within the White House to coordinate all government activities to protect US computer networks while promoting collaboration among a confusing landscape of federal cybergroups with 8220overlapping missions8221 The president is more than a little czar crazy perhaps because the vague post of whatever turns out not to require confirmation from a somewhat slow and balky Senate even as it brings instant attention to some new aspect of his megaagenda . In reality appointments tend to put yet another new layer of bureaucracy to already jumbled layers of the same layers of bureaucracy . As Paul Light Light, Paul Light, a government professor at New York University told the Wall  The Pentagon has moved to establish a new Cybercommand that won't shy away from either the word 8220unilateral8221 or 8220dominance8221 CyCom as it8217s already known will 8220develop cyberweapons for use in responding to attacks from foreign adversaries8221 Under the direction of Lieutenant General Keith B Alexander who will add another star to his three in the move from the National Security Agency to his new command .

May said she would retaliate swiftly against the Russian state against the United Kingdom and would swiftly retaliate against the Foreign Ministry against the British Foreign Ministry . The Russian Ministry of Foreign Ministry said it would respond swiftly against Moscow . The Foreign Ministry of the British Ministry said the Russian Foreign Ministry had treated the use of a militarygrade nerve agent in the UK with ‘disgusting’  White House8217s most unequivocal statement to date blaming Russia for the poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in London .

---  There is more than one side to every story and US media coverage has mainly reflected one side8212that of the rebels8217s . Media outlets from across the political spectrum became rebel mouthpieces unquestioningly relaying rebel claims while omitting crucial details about who the rebels were . US media outlets were quick to grant legitimacy to rebel accusations they ignored or downplayed rebel atrocities . While both sides have accused the other of carrying out massacres in Aleppo only rebel accusations received widespread US coverage . But the only evidence to emerge so far points to the rebels as culprits of their evacuation . Only evidence and photos corroborating video evidence and corroborating the fact that rebels have carried out mass summary executions of 100 Syrian soldiers they were found in a local school . The only evidence that points to rebels as the rebels are estimated to have executed 100 soldiers they held prisoner according to pro-government forces . The rebels have reportedly executed 100 Syrian Soldiers they were holding prisoner and found in local schools. The Western backers also reported finding mass beheadings and booby-of-booby-beheadings of civilians killed by the rebels. The rebels also received little evidence and found a gruesome beheading a gruesome mass graves. Despite the fact the rebels have tortured and tortured themselves  The Syrian uprising in Aleppo was never particularly popular in Aleppo . Yet they still supported the government largely out of opposition to the religious fundamentalism and brutality of the armed groups . Despite being warned about the extremist and violently sectarian ideology that dominated the opposition as early as November 2011 the Obama administration spent according to the Washington Post 61215 a colossal 1 billionayear training and funneling weapons to Al Qaeda8211linked extremists in order to weaken the Syrian government . Corporate media continue to promote lies about Obama8217s socalled inaction . Underneath all the grief and calls for revenge was exhaustion after five years of war these people were tired I didn8217t meet a single Syrian in the government areas I visited who hadn’t lost friends and family since the war started But their suffering with a few minor exceptions has been largely disappeared from Western media probably because the people most responsible for it are supported by the West probably because their suffering has been mostly disappeared from the Western media . The West is responsible for the deaths of many of the people who have been killed in the past five years, but their suffering is largely disappeared in Western media. The West has no idea because corporate media continues to promote its lies about the bloodshed in Syria to continue with impunity .
---  Crossroads GPS distorts the facts in TV ads that attack two Democratic Senate candidates for their roles in the Wall Street bailout and the federal health care law . The group released five TV ads last month and as we wrote at the time distortions abounded . Crossroads now seeks to portray Warren as a tool for Wall Street banks ridiculing her promise to be 8220a voice8221 for the middle class . Warren served from 2008 to 2010 as chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel a bipartisan committee set up by the same legislation that created the Troubled Assets Relief Program TARP . Warren and her committee had nothing to do with giving 8220big bonuses to bank executives8221 That was done by the banks and oversight of bonuses was the responsibility of the Office of Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation within the Treasury Department Kenneth Feinberg known informally as the 8220pay czar8221 headed that office . Warren was critical of executive compensation that relies too heavily on bonuses in an Oct 22 2009 interview on CBS Warren called it a 8220problem in American industry . Warren said in a 2009 interview that relies on shortterm gain ahead of longterm health of the company . Warren is responsible for the bailout but did not seek reimbursement because the payments were made by banks  Crossroads ad attacks Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska for demanding a 8220payoff for his vote . The ad actually refers to what critics called the 8220Cornhusker Kickback8221 a deal that was added to a Senate version of the health care bill and that would have given special help to Nebraska in the form of added federal Medicaid funds . The deal was later removed and the final legislation boosted federal funding for all states . Ad also says that 8220Warren went on a 8216charm offensive8217 with some of the same banks who got bailed out8221 That's a reference to a speech she gave to the Chamber of Commerce8217s annual Capital Markets Summit Crossroads cites a Politico article that described Warren8217's speech as a . 8220Charm offensive8221 because it was part of the White House8217’s 8220outreach to business8221 The ad neglects to explain what the supposed 8220Payoff8221 was The ad claims Nelson didn8217t get special help for himself in the deal and yet the very 8220 payoff it accuses him of seeking was in fact special federal funding just for his state As we said in the ad we point you to decide whether Warren
---  There are according to B8217T selem 82204484 Palestinians 8211 security detainees confined in Israeli prisons . Family contact is virtually impossible for prisoners most of who are held inside Israel . Detention without trial the presumption of guilt denial of family visits solitary confinement torture and violent interrogation and denial of access to appropriate health care . The UN makes its feelings clear in the 8216Question of Palestine Administrative Detention8217 report UNQAP when it says Israel 8220has historically ratified international agreements regarding human rights protection whilst at the same time refusing to apply the agreements within the Occupied Palestinian Territory . Since the sixday war in 1967 an estimated 750000 Palestinians have been incarcerated in . Israeli prisons including 23,000 women and 25,000 children . Since June 2007 an estimated 20% of the total Palestinian population in the occupied territory or 40 per cent of the Palestinian male population there . Israel has agreed to ease conditions as long as prisoners refrained from 8220recruiting people for terrorist mission such as 8220security activity . Israel committed to move prisoners from solitary confinement into the main block 8211 in every probability they aught not have been held in isolation to begin with and agreed to allow family visits from Gaza . The move would be a positive if implemented  Administrative detention is one of a series of suppressive measures written into the 8216Defence Emergency Regulations8217 that formed part of the British authorities rulebook in mandatory Palestine to control the Arab Revolt . The draconian regulations were quietly pasted and copied into Israeli domestic legislation in 1948 where they remain legitimizing actions such as house demolitions extensive stop and search measures the imposition of curfews and indefinite administrative detention . Administrative detention gives the occupying Israeli authorities the power to detain Palestinians or indeed Israelis without charge withhold any evidence and to hold them 8216presumed guilty8217 . Detention orders and issued at least three new ones since this deal was struck and family visits for Gazan prisoners have still not started . Israel has held him in administrative detention a number of times since 2000 times for a total of more than 2000 times . The IPSIDF manipulates inmates with promises of liberty and threats of incarceration in order only to crush it maximizing suffering and control it maximizing it in order to crush suffering and hope it . Israel regularly fails to take into account the best interests of the child as required under international law .

The subtitle suggests that the working people who constitute the backbone of the American economy and democracy are the best of the best critiques of liberalism from the Left or at any rate from someone who came out from any rate of any rate . Asamp160 is a continuation of all the efforts of Siegel to critique the Left and to what used to be the most admirable values as a warm regard for the lives of the ordinary working American working class . The book is a synthesis of several fine parts of postwar America and the subtitle suggests the subtitle suggest that the subtitle of the subtitle "Asamp160 suggests the best work of the essay is the backbone for the economy and American democracy and the best economic and democracy . The author is a master master of the master of modern American history and writes that Siegel is a historian of modern America. Siegel has written several fine books that remarried parts of the history of the post-war America and so on to the post war. The book has been published by Siegel.  Intellectuals such as Croly Randolph Bourne and HL Mencken were an emerging social type part of a 8220vanguard movement . They sought to create an American aristocracy of sorts to provide the stability hierarchy and taste that American mass democracy and bourgeois culture so conspicuously lacked . Siegel traces this strain of cryptoaristocratic longing through subsequent chapters on the LeopoldLoeb trial the Scopes trial and the SaccoVanzetti trial through the ideological maneuverings of the 8220Red Decade of the 1930s along with Bernard DeVoto . The author traces this longing through the cultural upheaval of the 8060s the McGovernization of the Democratic Party the destructive reign of antis-urban mayors such as Young in Detroit .

---  Sectarianism is a problem that has existed for decades but more recently has reached catastrophic dimensions with ISIS declaring just about ever religious rival as a takfiri . Nader Hashemi and Danny Postel have put together a collection of articles by experts in the field that is must reading for both those within the academy and those working for the cause of peace in the Middle East . The authors are entitled Sectarianization Mapping the New Politics of the Mideast and Mapping The Middle East of the Arab Spring . In the U.S. identity politics takes on an order of magnitude far weightier since it involves 8220confessional dimensions that in of themselves are based on faith rather than reason . In reality all religions are such but most religions have been restrained by freethinking and freedomloving humanity over hundreds of years This one was never restrained or controlled with every move it brings abominations and misery8221 This is the religion of death, says the authors in their introduction as crucial to resolving a crisis of legitimacy . In fact there tends to be a relationship between 8220weak states8221 and sectarianism and sectarianization since there will always be a need to set those who belong to a ruling class against each other .  Paulo Gabriel Hilu Pinto an Anthropology professor and director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Brazil had to say in a case study titled 8220The Shattered Nation the Sectarianization of the Syrian Conflict8221 As mentioned earlier the Assads deployed Islamic language and symbols to their own advantage so it is not that surprising that the protests beginning in March 2011 would share the regime's Islamist stance . Assad exploited their use to disparage the movement as Salafist extremism . Assad has successfully made it possible for jihadists to flourish in Syria by militarizing the conflict in the early stages and making peaceful protests impossible . When arms and financial support are only available from Islamist states like Saudi Arabia Turkey and Qatar it will be Islamist militias that get favored . Pinto describes how this led to the rise of the ascent of the Islamist militias and how this ultimately led to Jihadists who were bound together by an Islamic groups with the early goals of the revolution . All of this was needless to alienate allies of the early military strength of the Islamic revolution and what Assad planned to say was exactly what he planned. Besides the military strength and greater military resources and greater resources of the military and greater strength of Islamic militias began the rise

Disney must offer to buy all of Sky if it acquires TwentyFirst Century Fox's 39 percent stake and if Rupert Murdoch's Fox is prevented from purchasing all of the European payTV company itself itself if it is prevented by Murdoch's media influence .

The ruling means that if Fox's bid to buy Sky is blocked by the government in June it will have to step in to make the same offer to shareholders if and when it becomes the owner of Fox's assets .

The bill's sponsor said the measure would put Alabama law on special elections in line with that of the majority of states adding it was also aimed at saving the state money .

The US House of Representatives approved spending more money on metal detectors locks and other school security measures on Wednesday but took no steps to tighten gun control laws a month after a Florida high school shooting that killed 17 people . Prospect for meaningful gun control reforms in Congress remained remote in the face of stiff resistance from gun industry lobbyists . The White House said the bill falls short of broader gun control legislation though it falls far short of broad gun control . The bill would not become law without Senate approval though the House said it would not allow any of the funding to be used for arming teachers or other school personnel . The measure would not be taken up the funding for any of tighter gun controls at the White House or other schools in Parkland, Florida .

---  Charter schools are taxpayerfunded privately run schools freed from many of the rules that apply to traditional public schools . There are few hardandfast rules for how regulators charged with overseeing charter schools are supposed to do the job Many of these gatekeepers are woefully inexperienced underresourced and confused about their mission or compromised by conflicts of interest . Bad schools have been allowed to stay open and evade accountability . The National Association for Charter School Authorizers has worked to educate states and individual authorizers on what good oversight looks like while promoting measures such as 8220 default closure to help bypass authorizers that may be reluctant to close chronically underperforming schools . While there are promising signs NACSA acknowledges there8217s still a long way to go, it acknowledges there is still a lot of work to go 8220 to improve the quality of the charter school system in the long term but there are some good authorizers and there are many bad ones are not left out of the whole system are not yet good ones are left out .

An isolated office in Cincinnati plagued by what an inspector general this week describedamp160as 8220insufficient oversight8221 of fewer than 200 lowlevel employees responsible for reviewing more than 60000 nonprofit applications a year In the end this contributed to what everyone from Republican lawmakers to the president says was a major mistake .

In 1995 the Exempt Organizations division started to centralize Instead of field offices evaluating applications for nonprofits in each region those applications would all be sent to one mailing address a postoffice box in Covington Ky. Then a central office in Cincinnati would review all the applications . The IRS tried to remove discretion from lowerlevel employees around the country by creating rules they had to follow . In the years that followed the agency aimed to streamline for the division . In 2003 a task force for an ABA task force on social welfare nonprofits and politics were met with silence . Even the IRS investigated the same year were investigated by the IRS which investigated complaints of engaged charities engaged in politics and complaints of engagement in politics .

Nathan Price is the chairman of the DC Professional Taxicab Driver Association which was formed about twentyone years ago He has been an advocate for the rights of taxicab drivers for twentyfive years . Nathan has an undergraduate degree in Marketing with a minor in Economics He also has one year in a MBA program . The Real News Network invited Uber to come onto our program but instead they said instead of complaining about customer competition and furthering a stagnant taxi industry instead of improving their times and improving their taxi industry . We are happy to hear from the cabbies point of view. We want to ask you to use our questions about the issues of Uber and other rideshare services like lift. We have an answer to the questions of our questions of the question of the questions. We are asking you to answer the questions about Uber’s answers. We’re happy to answer these questions. You know if you want everybody to be licensed.  Uber has said a mouthful then but the problem is that theyre so brazen that they feel they can forget rules and regulation . In Washington drivers own most of their vehicles but that used to be about 85 percent of the drivers owned their own vehicles Thats a free entrepreneur system but that figure is now down to about 65 percent now and thats a large drop So therefore what is happening is that these drivers are being forced out of business and then you put Uber on top of that and they cry because they say see Uber cars come up from all over take the jobs away from them . Washington is one of the five taxicab cities in the United States and is propelled largely by conventions and the Congress and the federal government So therefore Uber has just taken advantage of a situation and traditionally that driverswhat theyre doing theyredrivers are losing their freedom In Washington . Uber has been stepping stone for people whether theyre from immigrants or people who are immigrants or minorities who could get nowhere else they were working for people who want to work in the business or really do really work in favor of consumers who do really do it in the favor of the interests of consumers or consumers who really do not want to do it .

The process overall sounded like something from Satan8217s kitchen grinding squeaking and squealing in a hellva racket . If I were to meet George W I would tell him this by way of suggesting that he did not know what he was getting the country into I would also invite the former president along to visit a chickenprocessing plant built with your tax dollars and overseen by my ePRT embedded Provincial Reconstruction Team . We really bought into the chicken idea and spent like drunken sailors on shore leave to prove it in this case the price was 258 million for the facility . The only problem was that no one did any market research in the market for any kind of frozen frozen chicken found on Iraqi store in 2010 was any one of the cheaper imported frozen chicken in In8221 The only one thing that didn't actually did any kind thing was that the workers knew what else else else was the workers and knew the workers who knew the price of the plant plus the pay for the feed  The poultry plant had a 8220business plan but it did not mention where or how the chickens would be marketed . A report on the poultry industry dated from June 2008 by the Inma Agribusiness Program part of the U.S. Agency for International Development recommended against the plant in 2008 . The Army and the State Department went ahead and built the poultryprocessing plant on the advice of Major Janice . Despite the report's worrying conclusion that there are no data on the size of the market for fresh chicken, no chickens were processed and for al Qaeda was still in business . A now defunct blog set up to publicize the project dubbed it 8220Operation Chicken Run dubbed it Operation Chicken Run and included one farmer who said: "I fought alQaeda with bullets before you Americans were here Now I fight them with chickens" The plant played host to three Embassy war tourists . Unlike the minority who traveled out on the real business at the Green Zone, most people were rarely if ever if ever left the most people at the most important place at the US Embassy .

---  Iran8217s Green Movement is one year old this Sunday the anniversary of its first massive demonstrations in the streets of Tehran . A year later the country is more repressive and its hardliners are in a far stronger position8212and some of their success can be credited to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sanctions hawks in the Obama administration . Yesterday the UN Security Council on punishing Iran produced a weak much watereddown resolution targeting 40 companies which lacked the allimportant imprimatur of unanimity . Israel sent commandos against a peace flotilla in international waters and landed its men guns blazing on the deck of the USS Sanctions Sanctions Yesterday the U.S. Sanctions hawks pressed for a pyrrhic victory for those hawks who had pressed for 8220crippling8221 sanctions and likely to be counterproductive rather than effective in ending Iran's nuclear enrichment program . The U.N. Security Council voted 8220no8221 and Lebanon abstained and Turkey and Brazil voted in the resolution did not even seem to make the new sanctions obligatory It was at best a pithithithy victory for the hawks . The Israeli government liked what it was hearing Israeli PM Netanyahu even went on to praise the Green Movement fulsomely  2009 however with the masses no longer regularly in the streets representatives of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany met directly with a representative of Khamenei in Geneva . A potentially pathbreaking nuclear agreement was hammered out whereby Iran would ship the bulk of its alreadyproduced lowenriched uranium LEU to another country . In return Iran would receive enriched rods with which it could run its single small medical reactor producing isotopes for treating cancer . There is no evidence that Iran has such a capability or intention but the Security Council members agreed that safe was better than sorry . With Khamenei8217s representative back in Iran on October 2 the Iranians suddenly announced that they would take a timeout to study it . On May 15th Erdogan and Lula met with Ahmadinejad in Tehran and announced a nuclear deal that much resembled the one to which Iran had briefly agreed in October . Turkey would hold a majority of LEU in escrow in return for which Iran would received enriched rods . Iran had even now more LEU which meant Iran had by now more than now more enriched LEU than Iran had already produced more than more LEu which meant less LEU . Israel is the only country in the Middle East with an actual success success since the agreement

The reorganization will see the number of people more than halved while about the same number will be hired in St Petersburg from where many trading operations will be executed according to one of the sources who did not give more specific details about where the cuts would happen .

Russian state banks such as VTB and companies such as Rosneft have since scaled back their presence in the West while some of Putin's closest allies have sold their assets in the UK and its companies have since sold assets in Russia . The move comes at a time of rising tensions with the West  Of 30 financial experts polled by Reuters who rate Trump8217s other economic policies in glowing terms only a handful expressed even lukewarm support for the tariffs .

---  In announcing that the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement a global accord aimed at addressing climate change President Donald Trump made more than a few false and misleading claims . The Paris Agreement was reached on Dec 12 2015 and it builds on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and it was accepted by all but two of the 197 countries that were party to the convention . International environmental law experts say that that is not true Trump is wrong He said the US actually may be more exposed to lawsuits if it withdraws from the agreement . The process for withdrawal isn't easy and it will take nearly four years to complete the process meaning that the final decision would not happen until after the 2020 presidential election . There is no liability mechanism under the Paris agreement . There was language in the agreement about loss and damage from climate change but the accompanying decision text stated clearly that this does not provide a basis for liability or compensation for claims Ironically this text had been added to address US concerns . The final agreement which was added to addresses US concerns to address the US concerns was added by the World Resources Institute in Paris on Dec 24 2015 .

---  Teachers in redstate America are hard at work teaching us all a lesson . Insurgent teachers are instructing us all about a tale of denial for which we8217ve paid a heavy price . The American mythos has always rested on a belief that this country was born out of a kind of immaculate conception that the New World came into being and has forever after been preserved as a land without class hierarchies and conflicts that so disfigured Europe . School teachers however have always been workingclass stiffs for a long time they were alsoamp160 mainly womenamp160 who would have instantly recognized the insecurities struggles to get by and low public esteem that plague today8217s embattled teachers . The sight of teachers striking and sometimes even breaking the lawamp160 breaking the Lawamp160 to do so still has a remarkable ability to shock the rest of us Somehow it just doesn't fit the image still so strong of the mildmannered middleclass lawabiding professionals that public school teachers are supposed to be, says David Frum . He says . Frum. The American Mythos is a reminder that class has always mattered far more in our public and private lives than our origin story would allow . The Mythos has never been a classfree America  Deindustrialization of America has paid handsome dividends to financiers merger and acquisition speculators, junk bond traders and corporations fleeing a unionized work force for the sweated labor of the global South . In the process deindustrialization ravaged the economic and social landscape of workingclass communities including that of redstate teachers . Acquiescence and austerity breed cultural decline, blaming of teachers for profound social breakdown they largely bore the brunt and were not the cause of . Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders might be symptomatic of our moment of a pathological condition of a disease of the recovery from the disease of austerity and acquiescence .

---  North Korea has long practiced its state religion Kim Ilsongism . All three countries labeled 8220the Axis of Evil8221 by President Bush in 2002 are presently religious states . Kim Jongil was born on Mt Paektu the highest mountain in Korea and Manchuria long revered by Koreans as sacred and the birthplace of their nation in 1942 . The Dear Leader himself was born in 1941 in Vyatskoye in Siberia in the Soviet Union . The DPRK Constitution states 8220The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung is the sun of the nation and the lodestar of the reunification of the fatherland8221 A monumental artwork called the Figure of the Sun8221 erected to mark the 100day memorial service for Kim in 1994 adorns a hill overlooking Pyongyang in 1994 . North Korea is more than a personality cult It seems to me more akin to the State Shinto imposed on the Korean peninsula by the Japanese imperialists after 1905 . The Meijiera reformers who created Japan8217s state religion were welleducated men who probably didn’t believe the mythology literally but thought it would allow for the effective control of the indoctrinated masses It did in fact work fairly well up until Japan’s crushing defeat in 1945  Kim Ilsong chose 8220believing in the people as in heaven8221 as his motto . Heaven Tian alludes to a moral cosmic order that confers its mandate on successive dynasties of Chinese rulers . In a Tungusic myth the ancient Korean nation of Choson was founded by the son of a bear who had been transformed into a woman by Hwanung ruler of a divine city on Mt Paektu and a tiger . In the Japanese myth the grandson of the Sun Goddess descends to earth to a mountain peak in Kyushu marries the daughter of an earthly deity loses his immortality and begets two sons one of whom sires the first emperor Jinmu by a sea princess who turns out to be a dragon . The Japanese imperial family also came down from heaven and became human . The Korean Workers8217 Party continues to cultivate ties with more traditional perhaps more 8220legitimate MarxistLeninist parties including the Maoist Communist Party of the Philippines . Some material by Marx Engels and Lenin circulates in North Korea and the Marxist dictum 8220Religion is the opium of the masses8221 .

A powerful spring storm pummeled the US Midwest and Plains on Saturday with blizzard conditions and high winds while tornadoes and thunderstorms threatened some of the South . Forecasters were expecting more than a foot of snow 30 cm in parts of Michigan Minnesota and Wisconsin . Freezing rain and ice storms were expected to move into northern New England through Monday through Monday . The United States France and Britain launched 105 missiles overnight in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Syria a week ago targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities including a research and development center in Damascus . The U.S. President Donald Trump called the operation a success He proclaimed on Twitter his mission 8220Mission accomplished on Twitter . The US President George W Bush said the operation was "Mission accomplished" in 2003 to describe the same phrase as Bush whose use of the phrase in 2003 was widely ridiculed as  US Vice President Mike Pence seemed less sure of the use of sarin saying that Washington may well determine that it was used along with chlorine . Smoke was still rising from the remains of five destroyed buildings of the Syrian Scientific Research Center in Barzeh where a Syrian employee said medical components were developed There were no immediate reports of casualties . Syria released video of the wreckage of a bombedout research lab but also of Assad arriving at work as usual with the caption 8220Morning of resilience8221 Late on Saturday Syria time a large explosion was heard in a Syrian governmentcontrolled area in a rural region south of Aleppo . The Pentagon said there had been chemical weapons agents at one of the targets and that the strikes had significantly crippled Syria8217s ability to produce such weapons . Inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW were due to try to visit Douma on Saturday to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack . The last buses were due Saturday to transport out rebels and their families who agreed to surrender the town state TV reported That effectively ends all resistance in the suburbs of Damascus known as eastern Ghouta . The Western countries took precautions to avoid unexpected conflict with Russia before the strikes . Russia had promised to respond to any attack on its ally but the Pentagon said
---  This is Part Three of my previous commentaries regarding Iran8217s environmental problems . I8217ve attempted to transfer the technology known as 8220seawater greenhouse8221 to Iran for close to ten years . The inventor of the technology was in Tehran and during the four days he was here we drafted a contract and the detailed workings of the unpatented public domain technology was clearly explained to me and a team of very smart engineers and horticulturists that I had recruited . At the end of this article I will provide detailed information on how the technology works and how best to implement it in Iran . With this information made public it is now up to those in Iran to . implement it be it through private or public funding . Iran needs to realize that solving our environmental problems be it the water crisis eliminating air pollution shifting to all electric vehicles building solar farms producing biodegradable plastics are all job creating enterprises . This has been proven to be the case in America China Europe and India with the latter even having a Ministry of New and Renewable Energy that offers low interest microloans . Iran builds buses many companies make electric motors and we even have a manufacturing plant making lithium batteries so bringing these things together should not be that difficult right  A detailed explanation of how the seawater technology works and how it could maybe play a very significant role in solving Iran8217s water crisis . The heart of the technology is a honeycombed cardboard wall over which salt water constantly flows . Using existing wind conditions or through the use of solar powered fans the air on the other side where the plants are is greatly cooled and there is an increase of water vapor creating favorable growing conditions . These conditions substantially lower the amount of water the plants require and this water is supplied via drip irrigation connected to a reverse osmosis unit powered by solar panels . If the city of Tehran was to fully support such a plan Tehran could be pollution free within five years . All it requires is for the city to issue the necessary permits and the city would be given the necessary necessary permits . The plan would be totally dependent on the cooperation of the full cooperation of government organizations and most likely that the government organizations did fully support these plans with these plans . There are no sanctions that get in the way for implementing this plan . The technology still functions in terms of lowering temperatures and increasing water vapor content on other side of the sea water is yet to be fully tested and calibrated but has not yet been fully tested or calibrated .

---  On October 11 2011 the Obama Administration claimed that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard CorpsQods Force IRGCQF had attempted to kill Saudi Arabia8217s ambassador to the US . The story was so bizarre FBI Director Robert Mueller stated that it 8220reads like the pages of a Hollywood script . The comical nature of the case made it appear so implausible that President Obama became defensive when he was asked about the issue in a press conference on October 13 2011 . President Obama also gave a hint as to why the Department of Treasury was involved in dealing with the alleged terror plot and what the US intended to do about it He stated that we will 8220apply the toughest sanctions against Iran and continue to mobilize the international community to make sure that Iran is further and further isolated and that it pays a price for this kind of behavior8221 A more specific answer became a more specific one when David Cohen gave his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee . Cohen announced that the US is tightening the financial screws and deepening the financial screw against Iran in the Treasury is available against Iran . After this testimony Cohen said that the U.S. Treasury was intent to use the alleged Iranian Central Bank or Markazi bank to paralyze the Iranian economy since Markazi is the bank  The American Israel Public Affairs Committee AIPAC summarized the two resolutions on its website under 8220Stop Iran8217s Nuclear Program8221 and called for action . In late May and early June of 2008 two resolutions were introduced in the House and Senate calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the Iranian nuclear threat and to impose tougher sanctions on Tehran . The Bush Administration however realized that the rest of the world would not go along with sanctioning Iran's Central Bank of Iran . Instead the Administration relied on the Treasury Department to sanction major banks in Iran and prepare the ground for sanctioning Bank Markazi at some later date . The push to sanction Iran's central bank of Iran continued during the campaign season and just prior to the presidential election of 2008 Senator Charles Schumer pressed the Bush Administration to impose financial sanctions on Bank Markaz . In August 8 2011 the Wall Street Journal reported that more 8220than 90 US senators signed a letter to President Barack Obama pressing him to sanction the central bank with some threatening legislation to force the move . The letter as the report stated was cosponsored by Senators Mark Kirk and Charles Schumer . The move would represent a stark escalation in tensions between Iran and the two countries and would potentially freeze Iran out of the global financial system

---  On the third anniversary of the invasion of Iraq our newspapers and TV news were filled to the brim with retrospectives on the origins of the Iraq war . Bush administration officials misestimated the amount of resistance they would find in the wake of Baghdad8217s fall Donald Rumsfeld and his civilian officials in the Pentagon ignored military warnings and did not deploy sufficient soldiers to handle this initial resistance . As a result the occupation was unable to quell the rebellion when it was small This first blunder allowed what was at best a modest insurgency to grow to formidable proportions at which point occupation officials committed a second disastrous blunder dismantling the Iraqi army which otherwise could have been deployed to smash the rebellion . The claim that the war has an economic foundation may sound strange in the context of U.S. media coverage because it is so unfamiliar because of the unfamiliarity of American media coverage of the war is so foreign companies were forbidden from obtaining all protections for the market wide open in an immediate elimination of large multinational marketing companies . This resulted in the elimination of local commerce quickly threw out all local businesses like air and cell phone sales to the middle class of previously unobtainable goods like air phones and cell phones . The problem it turned out that the CPAinduced economic  Unemployment rates quickly exceeded 25 in many communities and today 8212 nationwide unemployment estimates range from a depressionlevel 30 to a staggering 60 depending on the source you consult . The economic debacle affected different parts of the country with differing degrees of severity . The protests were made more pronounced by the residual loyalty many Sunnis held for the Saddam regime and their greater sense of violation from the invasion . In 2003 the occupation response to protests was forceful almost gleeful repression . It was an unworkable policy in the face of a deepening disaster caused in the deepening disaster of a disaster caused caused by a deepening economic disaster caused by the US occupation . The Kurds were largely shielded from the economic destruction in effect their isolation from the Iraqi economy now insulated them as well from the neoliberal depression wrought by the U.S occupation . In effect the Kurds were insulated from the economy as well as the economic deportation destination of the neoliberal depression wrought by the economic dehumanization of Iraq . The US military response to the growing resistance rested only on only on the anger of a growing resistance rests only on growing resistance . In fact the US military responded by overwhelming often lethal military force and arresting people suspected of antioccupation attitudes or activities .

---  Charter schools are taxpayerfunded privately run schools freed from many of the rules that apply to traditional public schools . There are few hardandfast rules for how regulators charged with overseeing charter schools are supposed to do the job Many of these gatekeepers are woefully inexperienced underresourced and confused about their mission or compromised by conflicts of interest . Bad schools have been allowed to stay open and evade accountability . The National Association for Charter School Authorizers has worked to educate states and individual authorizers on what good oversight looks like while promoting measures such as 8220 default closure to help bypass authorizers that may be reluctant to close chronically underperforming schools . NACSA acknowledges there are promising signs that there are still a long way to go in the charter school system as some strong authorizers are good it's not how many are there any bad ones are good, but in the long term you can ignore the presence of bad ones, said Alex Medler the group8217s vice president of policy and policy and hope to strengthen accountability for bad ones . The Minnesota Department of Education is just starting a new charter school office that the state is revoking charterschool accountability in recent years . The state has made some tough calls to revoking some charters schools when it sees  Trine took on schools that other authorizers were poised to close . Authorizer hopping is a big problem said David Harris who spent five years as a charter regulator in Indiana . Grand Valley State University a public university in Michigan is one of the largest charterschool authorizers in the state . National Heritage Academies a powerful forprofit firm with 80 charter schools across nine states is a forprofit company with 80 schools in nine states . Some of these groups sell 8220support services to the very schools they regulate to make additional revenue on top of fees they charge the schools . The university has a large number of NHA schools in its portfolio for one reason only only 8211 performance8221 But academic performance has been mixed at the NHA charter schools under Grand Valley8217s watch with a few recognized for high or improved performance and twice as many flagged for having some of the highest achievement gaps . NHA has reported last year that regulators at Grand Valley are hooked at the company are hooked by the company . The school board members are convinced that Grand Valley National Heritage are hooked and that the board is not convinced that they are hooked on the company’s own joint joint joint venture with the company. The university says it is completely separate from the company
---  Opponents of President Vladimir Putin used graffiti on Thursday to take an ironic swipe at Russia over the nerve toxin attack on a former double agent . Graffiti sprayed on the pavement near the entrance to the Russian embassy and ambassadors residence in London . Britain and Russia have been trading public insults over the use of a Sovietera nerve agent called Novichok to strike down former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury . In response to the attack Britain has given 23 Russians who it said were spies working under diplomatic cover at the London embassy a week to leave .

They are emblems of all that is nongenuine and dispensable that was precisely what a target drone was just a dummy made to be shot down . The idea dates back quite a while there were the CurtissSperry aerial torpedo and the Kettering Bug at the end of World War I and then the Nazi V1s and V2s unleashed on London in 1944 . The metamorphosis came about almost chance between Kosovo and Afghanistan as the new millennium began As early as 1995 General Atomics had invented a remontrolled spy plane prototype prototype . Despite its new name the disquieting beast was not yet equipped with claws or teeth or teeth . The drone limited itself to illuminating itself to filming itself to film targets and limited itself . In Kosovo where it was deployed in 1999 it was not equipped with the drone .

---  London's response to Russia after a nerve agent attack on British soil is unlikely to trouble Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin unduly despite the expression of outrage that greeted it in Moscow . Russia's foreign ministry described May8217s measures as a flagrant provocation and promised a speedy response . Russia denied any involvement in the attack and simply declined to say anything about how a Sovietera nerve toxin ended up striking down a former double agent on the normally genteel streets of the English city of Salisbury . London has shown just how little power it is willing to exercise while every Kremlin opponent will be more nervous about retribution . France with its own business ties to Russia has been more muted on the issue of Russian involvement in attack on Skripal than Germany or the United States . London as one of the top two financial capitals in the world is a major beneficiary for the oligarchs and Russian officials who flaunt their wealth across Europe 8217s most luxurious destinations . London remains open to Russian investment albeit with a political chill but London as it is the Western capital of choice for oligarch and oligarchs .

Proposal calls for creation of a new commissioner post to oversee the issue backed by independent panel of experts . Volker Kauder head of the conservatives in parliament spoke in favor of the proposal given Germany's Nazi past and the murder of 6 million Jews during the Third Reich . AntiSemitism remains a hugely sensitive issue in Germany more than 70 years after the end of the Naziera Holocaust .

Lawmakers in the State Duma which is dominated by Kremlin loyalists said they had prepared the list ranging from food and alcohol to medicine and consulting services in response to Washington's move last week . It was not immediately clear if the draft legislation which would allow the government to impose the measures would become law in its current form or if it had the backing of the Kremlin . A Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was understandable that Russian lawmakers wanted to retaliate against the US measures . Russia imported 125 billion worth of US products in 2017 according to official customs data that included aircraft machinery pharmaceutical and chemical products . The draft legislation would give authorities the power to impose bans or restrictions in multiple areas of trade with the United States if they deemed that Washington was threatening Russia 8217s interests .

---  Martin Luther King Jr once applied for a permit to carry a concealed handgun . After King's house was bombed in 1956 the clergyman applied in Alabama for a concealed carry permit . Local police deemed him 8220unsuitable and denied his application . King would end up leaving the firearms at home . Some NRA members have tried to suggest that King should be remembered as a guntoting Republican in recent years . But this portrayal neglects to acknowledge how Republicans used conservative anger about Civil Rights advances to win over the Dixiecrat South to their side of the aisle . Ultimately King never embraced the complete pacifism of pacifism and he was moved by the experience of the Black Power years later in 1962 . In September 1962 when King was addressing a Nazi Party member James Roy the 24-year-old American Nazi Party . He jumped onto the stage and struck the face of a white man in the face and struck a Nazi member . King was struck onto the face with the face in the . face of James Roy Roy Roy the . Nazi Party in September 1962 . King maintained his resolve under conditions that would make many others falter and would make other people falter . He maintained under conditions he would make some other . Others falter under conditions under conditions  In holding up King as an icon of individual pacifism we fail to see his true genius . Moral nonviolence without strategic vision rings hollow . It is only when the tenets of unarmed direct action are strategically employed made into effective weapons of political persuasion through campaigns of widespread disruption and collective sacrifice that nonviolence gains its fullest power . Martin Luther King did embrace strategic nonviolence in its most robust and radical form8212 But it is important to remember that these came years after his initial baptism into political life in Montgomery and that they might easily not have happened at all The road to Birmingham followed the successful bus boycott King sought out ways to spread the Montgomery model throughout the South . The next major breakthroughs in civil rights activism would come not from the SCLC but through the student lunch counter sitins that swept through the South starting in Spring of 1960 and then through the 1961 Freedom Rides . King had chosen his time and place and taking the many approaches of this approach to taking the approach of taking the Birmingham tactics of nonviolent resistance tactics . In 1963 the Birmingham approach was taking many approaches to using the tactics of using the techniques of nonviolent direct action that had been used in the Birmingham and Selma .

---  Azure Farms a 2000acre organic farm in Oregon states it is under threat from the local Sherman County government . Sherman County officials are reinterpreting a law concerning the 8220control of noxious weeds8221 so it means 8220eradication8221 These weeds can be controlled on an organic farm but the only way they can be eliminated according to conventional 8220science8221 is by spraying . That means Roundup and other toxic chemicals that would decimate the organic nature of the farm That would decertify it as an organic . Further according to Azure Sherman County plans to put a lien on the farm forcing it to pay for the spraying . The deadline for expressing opposition is May 22 A better deadline is May 17 Here is the complete press release from Azure Farms and the ways to register your concern . Darren Smith Weekend Contributor to jonathanturleyorg has been covering this story He reached out and obtained a devastating letter from agricultural scientist Charles Benbrook Benbrook . Dr Benbrook has his critics within the conventional pesticide and GMO research community . The scientific community is responding to this overreaching government action by acting in the interests of health and responsible environmental stewardship through advocacy in the hopes that officials in Sherman County will reconsider their mandate  Sherman County plan to forcibly spray a 2000acre organic farm in the county is 'deeply misguided' The notion that Sherman County can eradicate noxious weeds by blanket herbicide spraying is deeply misguided . Over 120 million acres of cultivated cropland in the US is now infested with one or more glyphosateresistant weed for details see httpcehnhealthykidsorgherbicideuseresistantweeds.org . Sherman County proposal simply pushes the herbicide useresistant weed treadmill into high gear . Over the last 20 years excessive reliance on glyphosate or herbicides overall has created multiple new noxious weed . weeds posing serious economic environmental and public health threats . The majority of glyphosateresistant weeds are in the Southeast and Midwest where routine yearafteryear planting of Roundup Ready crops has led to heavy and continuous selection pressure on weed populations pressure that over threetosix years typically leads to the evolution of genetically resistant weed phenotypes that can then take off spreading across tens of millions of acres in just a few years .

---  Malcolm Gladwell's article is a procharter chapter from a pro-charter book . Gladwell advances the stereotype that lowincome US students will only succeed if they study as hyperindustrious Japanese and South Korean students do . The text is unsuitable to teach because of its omissions and its failure to answer key counterarguments even ones that Gladwell explicitly raises . I am a South Bronx public school teacher who is expected to teach my students that they must enroll in charter schools and leave 8220desultory8221 public schools such as ours if they wish to succeed I along with scores of other high school teachers . I do not dispute Gladwell8217s argument for providing more schooling or other means of enrichment to American children during summers and I don’t dispute it . The remainder of Gladwell’s piece describes the KIPP experience. Gladwell also lauds a typical KIPP Academy for completing so much schoolwork at extended KIPP work at six days at a school including extended schoolwork and homework requirements that she has little time to talk to her mother or mother to eat or talk to homework . There is no evidence that the reformers8217 actually believed in this crop analogy Gladwell actually believed that overstudy  Gladwell is engaging in a classically American sort of fearmongering by comparing US students to those of East Asia rather than Europe Canada and Australia . Success in elite schools correlates with conformity and conventional thinking . The US never beats Canada Australia or Western European countries in any category that reflects the overall quality of life of its people . Gladwell's dark secret 8211 that media elites will never reveal 8211 is that the US actually overachieves on standardized tests . We have fallen prey to the stereotype that we are ignorant and lazy and stupid, but anyone pretends to be shocked by this can go ahead and go ahead by this pretends that this is why it is so easy for writers as Gladwell to count and we will nod on cue . Tell us that the next moment that we should be the next one test scores should be in the Olympic Medal Medal Medal count. Tell us the next number one test score is the number one at the moment. We should be at the casino at the top of the Olympic medal count. We are exceptionally fat and stupid and readily agree that we will readily agree to agree with us. We will agree with Gladwell’s easy to agree. We’ll readily agree with anyone who’ve been told that
---  A long piece by Victor Davis Hanson that deals with the crisis in the Republican Party is even worse than it looks I'll share that with you in a minute here . He says it's kind of strange that we're worried about Armageddon being brought on by Trump when we8217re living the apocalypse of Obama and Clinton . This is something I think Trump supporters have already figured out and I think a lot of people instinctively have come across it or had it reflected in their minds as they ponder all of this It certainly spells it out for me In fact grab sound bite number five I was gonna skip past this because I couldn8217t find any reason for it to relate to anything other than me being discussed in the media but actually it now plays off of the VDH thing really well You will remember this because it plays off with the VH thing really . I asked 8220Where was all this during Obama Where8217s all this rage? Where is all this anger at stuff that actually is happening and has been happening for seven and a half years8221 We haven’t had any anger of the sort from the Republican establishment that’s being directed at Trump . And I'm not saying any of this from a proTrump position here I8217  Victor Davis Hanson says we8217re worried about Armageddon with Trump because Trump8217s clueless and Trump doesn8217t know anything and Trump is a neophyte . The outrage at Trump to me has always been out of proportion This fear this shouting of the dangers Trump represents is what the hell do you think we're living through is Anyway that's the point of VDH's long piece here at National Review . The author says we're worried that Armageddon is on the Trump horizon while we are living amid the apocalypse of Obama and Clinton . He says that all these people getting upset that Trump didn't know about the nuclear triad how about Obama not knowing how to pronounce 8220corpsmen8221 or thinking there are 57 states or riffing about those Austrianspeaking Austrians or perhaps of Hillary Clinton or the Falklands or the Maldives or the 57 states . VDH says all these flipflops on the minimum wage and tax increases on the rich are Trump's just rolling the dice as he goes Trump's cluelessness about the foreign policy choice in 2016 is more appalling than Obama's choice in the supposed foreignbery choice in foreign policy than anyone else where was the outrage at anybody else where were the outrage. anybody else .
---  Knesset has enacted a law that forbids Palestinian women in the occupied territories from joining their husbands in Israel . The freedom of love and marriage is one of the basic human rights . Denying to 14 million Israeli citizens solely because they are Arab is a severe violation of the international Bill of Rights that has been signed by Israel . Israel is a 8220Nation state of the Jews and therefore it has the right to do anything that serves Jews and harms nonJews even when they are Israeli citizens . But as usual with us 8220security8221 is serving here as camouflage for the real reason behind the prohibition . Behind the prohibition lurks the demographic demon a demon with a sinister power over the brains of Israelis that can twist their thoughts extinguish the last spark of decency and morality and turn quite normal human beings into monsters . The good of the individual has to give way to the common good8221 a respected professor said about the case of Sammy . The common good forbids allowing allowing allowing the Palestinian wife of Sammy to enter Israel which is the Jewish Nation State8221 . Many may feel that all citizens are equal before the Supreme Court says that Israel is equal to Israel . Many Israelis feel that way that is contrary to the contrary which says that Israeli legislation denies  The education system spends on an Arab child one fifth of what it spends on a Jewish one . Twice Israeli soldiers and policemen have shot at Arab demonstrators who are Israeli citizens killing several of them . Twice the police shot a Jewish demonstrator who was shooting at them from the roof of his home . Now everybody understands that a confrontation with the problem cannot be evaded anymore at the end of the 1948 war in which the state of Israel was founded only a small number of PalestinianArabs remained . The existence of a national minority of this size cannot be ignored It cannot be pretended anymore that the problem does not exist or that it can be solved and dismissed by some millions of shekels more Israel is facing a fateful decision which will determine the character of its relations with its Arab citizens but also the very character of the state itself . Israeli democracy is faced with a choice between two alternatives a A citizen8217s state in which all the citizens are equal irrespective of ethnic origin or religious faith or nationality . The state will be based solely on citizenship . There will be no difference between a Jewish Arab or Polynesian citizen . Relations between the individual and the state will not be based on citizenship but the state would be based purely on citizenship. The state is not concerned with ethnic origin

---  Barack Obama responded to recent controversy over his former pastor's controversial remarks . Obama called on all Americans to recognize that racial anger exists among both whites and blacks . He said that this anger and its causes must be fully acknowledged before further progress can be achieved . Obama identified the sources of racial resentment held by whites without being judgmental . He declared that bridging the very real racial divide of today is essential to forging the popular coalition necessary to transform America into a society with a universal and effective health care system an education system that serves poor and rich children and an economy that yields a decentpaying jobs for all . Obama was not playing the race card He was shooting the moon Obama delivered his speech in a stiff manner . The melodious lilt and cascading tones that typically characterize his campaign addresses were not present . He began with a predictable notion slavery was the original sin of the glorious American project of the American project. Obama identified with both the winners and losers of America 8220. He said: 'In no other country on Earth is my story even possible8221 He is E Pluribus Unum without being coy about it Obama declared that race has been an issue in the campaign. He was shot the moon. Obama delivered the speech in the  Obama declared references to race are unavoidable in assessing America8217s ills and needs . In assessing America 8217s needs Obama declared reference to race were unavoidable . Obama noted that all this history 8220helps explain the present wealth and income gap between blacks and whites . A similar anger exists within segments of the white community . Anger is not always productive indeed all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition and prevents the AfricanAmerican community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change . End the blame game game game in the end of the post-racial transformation end he argued black and white matters less important than black matters less than black issues and less than a black matter less. End the end. In the end, black issues should be less important and less important, Obama argued. His postracial transformation should end the post racial transformation end the end and less counterproductive and less harmful. His economic class and economic power should be counterproductive and more important. His racial issues of economic class should be so counterproductive and his economic class is less important. He argued black issues of black class and less powerful. His message is not just black and powerful. It is not about racism.
---  Capital and its states are usually able to respond with amazing speed to crises using them to consolidate power . But the phoenixlike ability of capital to rise from its own ashes has a limit which can be defined precisely as the revolutionary situation . The establishment has the resources and inclination to plan strategically 8212 in both public and covert fora 8212 it is no stretch to assume that it invests some resources in heading off the unrest that result from these limits . The Israeli state has been implementing a succession of strategies designed to make such an uprising extremely unlikely to succeed since the early 1990s . The Separation Wall and the settlement project to divide the West Bank East Jerusalem and Gaza into a series of walledoff heavily policed cantons has crippled the resistance capability of the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories . The Palestinian Authority and its attendant humanitarianaid economy tightly though not seamlessly integrated into the Israeli security state has severely compromised the integrity of parties unions and other formerly independent Palestinian political organizations . The U.N. aid and the NGOization which has gone along with it have severely compromised Palestinian political groups have severely compromise the integrity of parties unions . Despite these heavy setbacks the Occupies Territories are not completely quiescent Villages have mounted a patient intelligent  The protest movement offers an opportunity for the consolidation of a crossclass coalition including a contingent of young middleclass people facing the possibility of impoverishment and those who are already staring poverty and homelessness in the face . At its best and most dangerous it has the potential power to challenge the Israeli state But this challenge probably would not have the power to overthrow the state and local capital even if it could unite its forces within Israel Decades of neoliberal restructuring may have cut away most positive bases for identification with the state but Israelis are still wired to close ranks whenever a 8220security threat8221 looms . Segregation has become so entrenched that today Israeli Jews and Palestinians from the Occupied Territories have little opportunity to meet each other without the barrel of a gun intermediating and this segregation makes it almost impossible to build a unified or even a coordinated mass politics across the Green Line despite valiant efforts made by the Israeli and Palestinian Lefts . A significant bridge across the divide exists in the shape of the 12amp160million strong Palestinian community within Israel Though to a certain extent exempted from apartheid 8212 the links between Palestinian Israelis and their neighbors are also subject to severe restriction and surveillance .

---  In recent years we have seen a steady increase in antiLatino or antiimmigrant violence alongside a notable spike after September 11th in anti8220Arab8221 violence . Violence against Latino immigrants to be the fastest growing of all hate crimes fuelled by an atmosphere of linguisticracial hatred and permissiveness to violence against all those deemed to be from 8220elsewhere8221 In this rising tide of state and informal violence Arizona has come to be ground zero for the antiimmigrant movement . The ties between this formal antiimmigrant racism and the prisonindustrial complex are increasingly clear as INCITE recently revealed that the US government8217s antiimmigration enforcement budget had increased nearly tenfold since 1993 to 136 billion in 2008 . Repeal Coalition Coalici243n de Cambio has brought together members of groups like No More DeathsNo M225s Muertes and Bring the Ruckus and which 8220demands the repeal of all laws8212 that degrade and discriminate against undocumented individuals and that deny US citizens their lawful rights8221 . In 2008 Arizona border deaths on the Arizona border regularly account for half of all border deaths and 2008 is on pace to be a recordsetting year . No More deaths account for 50% of border deaths along the border deaths .  Repeal Coalition members have been canvassing Flagstaff8217s Latino community heavily for months in an effort to put the undocumented community in the drivers8217 seat of the coalition while building the organizational basis for further resistance and struggle As members put it each door has brought us closer to the reality and fear that undocumented and people of color are facing on a daily basis . Flagstaff residents recognized that they needed to respond more directly to the needs and desires of that community as a result the 8220sanctuary city8221 resolution has in practice served in practice as an organizing tool to build a community movement8221 The very next day Flagstaff was under full ICE assault doors were kicked in communitymembers were arrested and as tends to be the case in ICE raids families were torn apart . There are also reports that contradicting stated policy Flagstaff police aided ICE in gaining entry and even allegations that family members were detained as a sort of 8220ransom until the targets of arrest turn themselves in . There have also been more demand for community support reliable contacts that undocumented residents can call upon for groceries or supplies if they are too atrisk to leave their homes safely . The raids were only issued for overstaying visas and some were up to a decade old .

Obama is deliberately making people so upset What is driving him Anybody got any ideas I8217ve been watching the childrenashumanshields show that is now going on at the White House Boy these guys are somber Biden was very somber . I've got the 23 executive orders here There are 23 executive actions I got the PDFs earlier this morning They were embargoed until the president started speaking and a summary of these 23 as well It8217s called the Gun Violence Reduction Executive Actions You go through this and there isn8217t one of them that would have stopped what happened at the Sandy Hook Elementary School Not one of these would have been stopped this Not-one of these Would have stopped this You couple what the president talked about today with Governor Cuomo and what he did in New York Governor Cuomo has now told therapists that they gotta be on the lookout for strange behavior and they gotta analyze potentially dangerous behavior If they think somebody might use a gun in a dangerous way they gotta report that person And this has been ramrodded through  NRA ad calling the president a hypocrite by trying to deny parents the same thing he provides his kids with protection . Obama is out there saying 8220pundits8221 who frame this as an assault on liberty just want to gin things up to cause fear My friends I8217m here to tell you It's the president ginning things up It8217s the president creating unrest and fear and instability and I don8217t know why I mean I know the president's political leanings I know what his ideology is I know why and what about this country he doesn't like and wants to change I understand all that but I don't understand why he wants to get in people's faces and irritate them I don’t understand what drives him on that Now I can understand some underwearclad pajamaclad unhappy sniveling little liberal in the basement blogging about why he would want to make you mad because he’s miserable and he wants you to join him in it But the president is miserable. He said that 40 of gun purchases today are purchased by people whose backgrounds are not checked and he said this 70 of the American people and a majority of NRA members favor universal background checks .

---  Tim Kaine is a top contender to be Hillary Clinton8217s running mate . The 58-year-old Democratic US senator from Virginia is on a threeperson short list receiving full vetting according to the Associated Press . Kaine was born in St Paul Minnesota but grew up mainly in a suburb of Kansas City where he spent time after school working in his father's ironworking shop . Kaine bears a political resemblance to the candidate he might join on the Democratic ticket sharing a political pragmatism focused on inching policy along and eschewing grand gestures . He is a devout Catholic driven by the gospel of social justice and less concerned with the social issues that have become political wedges . Kaine has been branded as 8220a progressive who gets things done and has dedicated himself to incremental progress in a redturnedpurple state . The prospect of Kaine on the ticket has been met with hostility by some on the left wing many of whom are pining for Warren . Kaine is not temperamentally suited to satisfy liberals who want to see Donald Trump torn apart and his fellow billionaires demonized . Kaine isn’t temperamentally suitable to satisfy those who want Donald Trump’s fellow billionaire demonized Instead Kaine is the devout Catholic and speaks fluent Spanish8212  Kaine was gearing up to run for the top job from his first day as lieutenant governor . Kaine saw that the increasingly liberal cities in the state and the diverse collegeeducated suburbs in Northern Virginia offered a path for Democrats to win statewide elections without shying away from progressive views . Kaine was tapped to deliver the Democratic response to Bush's 2006 State of the Union speech less than a month after moving into the governor's office . Kaine built a new Democratic coalition of women and minorities that didn't need the voters from conservative rural areas a strategy that Barack Obama would replicate to win the state in 2008 and 2012 . Kaine came close to serving as Obama8217s vice president but was axed due to his little foreign policy experience but Obama wanted Kaine on his team Shortly after his election Obama recruited Kaine to oversee the Democratic National Committee . Kaine resigned his position at the DNC and entered the U.S. Senate seat in February 2011 to take over the Democratic Senate seat he had used a similar to the one he had had used during his gubernatorial campaign . Kaine is now running for the Senate . Kaine has run for a second term in the Senate after resigning from his position as a Democratic senator from the DNC in February 2010 to take on a running for a Senate seat .

The formerly freewheeling retailer began requiring suppliers to use a firm of its choosing to restock shelves and run promotions as first reported in the Washington Post earlier this year . The changes have caused heartburn for some small upstart brands as Whole Foods has begun to act like a more mainstream business . The company has worked for the last two years to streamline its processes across global and regional purchasing teams to ensure all its suppliers are supported under a consistent companywide set of protocols to ensure they support each other . Amazon is charging some suppliers the equivalent of 3 percent to 5 percent of sales to cover the cost of those broker services to cover its broker services . In addition Whole Foods

His parents immigrated from small towns near Guadalajara Mexico in 1986 and landed in this workingclass neighborhood and lived with relatives . The mayor of Chicago at the time Richard M Daley announced an initiative that would usher in a new wave of school reform It was called 8220Renaissance 20108221 and the goal was to open 100 new public schools in five years twothirds would be charters It would eventually close Jose8217s grammar school and create his high school The first school opened in 1999 when Jose was just eight years old after two CPS teachers had become convinced they could run a more successful school than the ones they worked in Noble . Noble was strict safe and had a singleminded focus about sending kids to college . The school was free from Chicago Public Schools bureaucracy and the teachers union Jose recalls his parents simply wanted him to go to college and saw Noble as a way to get him there Now Jose is now part of a new graduate program Noble created in partnership with the Relay Graduate School of Education which is taking a radical new approach to training teachers . He doesn8217t have a license or a degree in education  Noble leaders floated the idea of recruiting and training their own teachers . Mindy Sjoblom the former Dean of Instruction at Jose8217s high school and now the principal led the charge . She recruited Jose Garcia to be a teacher at Noble . He will have to wait a full year before getting his own classroom . Each one of the 16 people she recruited to teach at Noble will work under licensed teachers in other Noble schools .

---  In an era of rapidly expanding technology government and others are finding new ways to surreptitiously observe traffic and one day your own automobile license plate will probably become their accomplice by sending out a radio signal . Civil libertarians worry that in coming years more and more socalled radio frequency identification RFID data will be gathered from highways and streets as Americans take trips or go about their daily business . The notion of hightech plates is alive and thriving in California and elsewhere who are locked in a love affair with the potential of the technology . If present trends are borne out you will have a smart plate of some kind on your car in the next 10 years or so already smart plates are in use abroad and the US federal government has disclosed its interest in the possibility of having such an apparatus on motorcycles as well as cars and trucks . The author of SB 1453 state Sen Curren D Price Jr. argued California should not be late to the discussion of this emerging technology whether it is used for public service or commercial messages or if it is necessary for use on our roads . He countered the LA Times editorial on several points factual and otherwise and argued that there is 8216nothing as powerful as an idea whose time has come 8230 In effect he was  RFID technology has been in the wind internationally for a number of years and is of sharp interest to law enforcement and other governmental agencies in foreign countries as well as the US . RFID chips aren8217t in standard license plates in the US but the technology has a substantial presence on American thoroughfares It is now used in automated collection of highway or bridge tolls and for a variety of other trafficrelated purposes . The active RFID that is made possible by embedded microchips is a major advance over using optical character recognition to read license plates . In May Portugal found itself facing a privacypropelled outcry against a national law requiring that all vehicles have microchip license plates by July of next year RFID license plates to be made available by July 2015 . In recent days the leading US mountain resort company announced it is now using chips in chips in tickets and passes in a sophisticated system that tracks the runs of skiers at five Colorado and California resorts . In a news report from Auburn Calif last December described how a system works in that town of 13,000 . The cameras work in all weather conditions with infrared for night work They also can take pictures at high vehicular speeds and can take photographs at high traffic speeds .

The strike was symbolic at best as the Assad regime ran bombing missions from the same airfield the very next day . While 89 million is a rounding error in the Pentagon8217s 600 billion budget it represents real money for other agencies . Since 2001 the US had racked up 479 trillion in current and future costs from its wars in Iraq Afghanistan Pakistan and Syria as well as in the war at home being waged by the Department of Homeland Security .

The Veterans Administration has tripled since 2001 and yet the VA still can’8217t catch up with its backlog of cases or hire doctors and nurses fast enough to meet the need for care in a timely fashion . The biggest challenge the biggest challenge is the sheer volume of veterans generated by Washington’s recent wars and the flood of veterans they have already been awarded lifetime disability benefits . Imagine what a report might look like in 2032 if a president decides to continue to pursue neverending wars in  President Trump has pledged to offset sharp increase in Pentagon funding with corresponding cuts in domestic and State Department spending . Eliminated would also be 8 billion worth of block grants that provide services to lowincome communities including subsidies for seniors who can8217t afford to heat their homes . The biggest beneficiaries of Pentagon largesse will as always be the major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin which received more than 36 billion in defenserelated contracts in fiscal 2015 . The top 100 defense contractors received 175 billion from the Pentagon in fiscal year 2015 nearly onethird of the Department of Defense8217s entire budget . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the construction costs alone of such an effort would be 800 billion over the next three decades at an annual cost of 266 billion which is 40 higher than the Navy's present shipbuilding budget .

---  Transition is a sustainability movement that has spread to 1105 towns in 43 countries over the past eight years . The movement is more about shifting paradigms than prescribing solutions . The seed for Transition came in 2004 when Rob Hopkins encountered the concept of peak oil the theory that easytoreach oil will run out at a specific date . It would be a mistake to think that becoming a Transition Town means setting off on a clearcut path to energy independence . Transition Town is a social experiment on a massive scale but it is a sine qua non however it is the belief that communities must become more resilient in the face of three catastrophic threats peak oil global warming, global warming and economic instability . Kinsale, England declared the first official Transition Town in 2006 offers perhaps the most fully realized example of Transition in 2006 . The mayor backed by the mayor is perhaps the first Transition Town . The town with a population of nearly 30,000 residents is perhaps most fully-planned energy usage in 2030. The town boasts nearly 30-years-worth of green buildings with a green buildings officer and a horseandcart taxi taxi . The city boasts nearly 400 residents of nearly 7400 residents of 7400 people of 7,400 . The Transition Town has nearly 30  In parts of Europe Transition has had to respond to the pressing needs of communities decimated by the ongoing Eurozone crisis . In Brazil Transition primarily fosters social enterprise projects it has given birth to a community bakery and a business turning old advertising banners into bags . In the United States there have been 139 Transition Towns and 200 unofficial 8220mullers8221 have sprouted Transition has also taken its own distinct path Most of the Transition towns have popped up in places one might expect relatively moneyed green hippie enclaves like Boulder Colo the first official US Transition Town . None have taken root so far in any conservative strongholds although there are a number of urban initiatives in Boston Houston Los Angeles and Cleveland to name a few . Chicago has launched numerous projects such as ecofriendly overhauls of city buses and a park modeled on New York City . More than 1060 mayors have signed the US Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement a pledge to meet the goal of the Kyoto Protocol the U.S. climate protection Agreement . The United States was one of only four countries not to join to reduce carbon emissions below 1990 levels .

Some say the group a selfdescribed adhoc coalition of activists that 8220seeks to end the LGBT movement ended up doing little more than angering and alienating people who should be their allies . Others say the loudest denunciations seemed to come from cis white gay men who were mad because their party got delayed . No arrests were made though some No Justice protesters say they were kicked and spit on The parade was significantly delayed and eventually was re-routed There was a strong presence of DC Metro Police at the site of the protest No Arrest was made No Justice no arrests . The group plans a 8220debrief and forum on Friday June 23 Look for the group on Facebook for details for details on June 23 look for details at nojusticenopride.org and for a full list of their demands can be found at noJusticenpride.com/no-pride-parade/org .

Accounts of exactly what happened how the protest was handled and who exactly was behind it differ based on whom you ask . Emmelia Talarico a No Justice No Pride senior organizer said she had no knowledge of who that group was . She also denied other rumors circulating this week that some of the protesters at the Saturday parade were paid . A lot of this is coming from fissures that have been boiling beneath the surface for decades, said a longtime DCbased trans activist who runs Casa Ruby a local LGBT community center .

---  Bob Moses was a field secretary for SNCC and one of the main organizers of the Mississippi Freedom Summer project during the 60s . Bob Moses says the project was "an earned insurgency" Bob Moses: We ran what I think of now as an earned insurgency . We had to earn the respect of farmers and sharecroppers that we were working with . We earned the right to call on the whole country to come take a look at itself in Mississippi . We were asking people to risk their lives so we had to show them we were actually also willing to do that ourselves right . And the Justice Department was not going to interfere around something other than voter registration . We also had to be disciplined ourselves to work on the voter registration so that every time we got arrested there was the presumption that thats what we were arrested for right. We were disciplined ourselves . We spent every night leaving McCombzie . Louis Allen is a witness to Herbert Lees murder and Amandzie came down every week leaving a week leaving the McCombz . The Justice Department is now debating debating should we should we have a summer project and debating debating the Civil Rights Act right in the middle of the winter of 63 . This is now in the mid-winter of 63. And  Mickey Schwerner was part of a small group of people that decided we were not going to live in this country unless we could change it Right So it was much my choice I felt I was in as much of a position as those people we were working with JAY So tell us more about the summer MOSES Well so when Louis Allen is murdered I go back and I throw my weight in for the summer project cause when Herbert Lee was murdered all we could do was commit ourselves . And so we then move through SNCC and CORE and some of the NAACP chapters and gather what in the end came to be 600 to 700 young mostly white college students teachers doctors and lawyers . The first ideas of setting up community health clinics got its start in the context of Mississippi Freedom Summer . The whole state of Mississippi was in this paranoia that they were somehow going to be invaded right And they had their tanks and guns I mean it was like they were going to go to war in a real shootout right JAY Invaded by MOSes Invading by Moses . Mos. But what Im getting at is clearly youre risking your life Youre getting knocked down and standing back up Mos . And where did they come from Mos
---  Marco Rubio responded to President Obama's State of the Union address on behalf of his fellow Republicans . Rubio: America is exceptional because we believe that every life at every stage is precious and that everyone everywhere has a Godgiven right to go as far as their talents and hard work will take them Like most Americans for me this ideal is personal . The opportunity to make it to the middle class or beyond no matter where you start out in life it isnt bestowed on us from Washington It comes from a vibrant free economy where people can risk their own money to open a business . President Obama believes its the cause of our problems that the economic downturn happened because our government didnt tax enough spend enough and control enough And therefore as you heard tonight his solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more borrow more and spend more . More government isnt going to help you get ahead Its going to hold you back and create uncertainty. More government breeds complicated rules and laws that a small business cant afford to follow . Rubio opposes your plans because I oppose your plans to protect the rich because I want to protect your middle class . He accuses us of wanting to save Social Security and Medicare and Social Security . He even criticized us for refusing to raise taxes to delay military cuts cuts  Economic growth is the best way to help the middle class . If we can get the economy to grow at just 4 percent a year it would create millions of middle class jobs . The President should abandon his obsession with raising taxes and instead work with us to achieve real growth in our economy . We must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws, but unconstitutionally undermining the 2nd Amendment rights of lawabiding Americans is not the way to do it On foreign policy America continues to be indispensable to the goal of global prosperity and safeguarding human rights and safeguarded liberty . The world is a better place when America is the strongest nation on earth, but we cant remain the strongest on earth But we don't have an economy that can't afford to remain powerful if we don’t remain powerful. The President laid out false choices like the ones the government is just out of business or big government or the ones laid out . We need to stop the President laying out false choice between big government and big business or business, but the President is just a good choice between government or big business . We have been playing a good game of playing of playing . Of course we face other challenges as well as a good

The classification and naming of brown bears which include grizzly bears as well has gotten embrangled with this evolution of theory and methods informing taxonomic deliberations . Brown bears exhibit a substantial amount of morphological variation driven by diet rather than evolutionary descent or corresponding variation of the genome . The same genetic stock can give rise to enormous uniformlybrown coastal bears and diminutive blond arctic grizzlies each with distinctly different skulls yet they are of the same approximate lineage with the same biogeographic history of the bears all living on Kodiak Island and the rest of the rest .

Clade 3 is dominant everywhere else with subClade 3b predominant in the interior of North America . The subspecific variants have been robust to the vagaries of method primarily because their taxonomicallyrelevant morphological features are distinctive enough to have arisen from distinguishable genetic differences .

---  US President Donald Trump made a surprising threat on Friday to veto Congress8217 newly passed 13 trillion spending bill . The move raised the specter of a government shutdown ahead of a midnight deadline to renew funding for federal agencies . A senior House aide said there were no plans to call lawmakers back for a special session all but guaranteeing there would be a shutdown unless Trump backed down from his threat . The White House aides were caught by surprise by the veto threat and had no immediate explanation for what prompted it . The threat marks the third consecutive month of government funding snafus as Congress has not turned over funding to make good on his campaign promise to build a wall along the USMexico border . Trump also has been at odds with Democrats in Congress over the fate of Dreamer immigrants those brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children . The bill includes 16 billion for six months of work on the project although he had sought 25 billion for it to build the project . The government shut down for three days in January as lawmakers fought over immigration and three days as Congress fought over the issue in January . In February there was an hourslong shutdown when a Republican lawmaker delayed a funding bill to protest a hike in the US deficit in February . The Republican Speaker Paul Ryan  President Emmanuel Macron said the incident appeared to be a terrorist attack and security forces were securing the area . President said the man had demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam the prime surviving suspect in the Islamic State attacks that killed 130 people in Paris in 2015 . Collomb said France is part of a USled coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and has thousands of soldiers in West Africa fighting al Qaedalinked militants . The 28member EU collectively condemned the attack and declared in a Brussels summit statement that it was 8220highly likely8221 Moscow was responsible . European Union member states agreed at a summit on Friday to take additional punitive measures against Russia for a nerve agent attack in Britain as Moscow accused the bloc of joining a Londondondriven hate campaign against it .

But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said evidence of Russian culpability presented by British Prime Minister Theresa May is 8220very solidly based8221 and promised new measures after EU leaders agreed late on Thursday to recall their ambassador to Moscow . The Czech Republic and three Baltic states Latvia Estonia and Lithuania were among those expulsions of Russian diplomats from their capitals . However Boris Boysov
---  President Barack Obama put on hold the much anticipated US attack against Syria . Obama thereby brought to a screeching halt a process extending back over six decades in which successive inhabitants of the Oval Office had arrogated to themselves or had thrust upon them ever wider prerogatives in deciding when and against whom the U.S. should wage war . The Federalist Society should offer Obama an honorary lifetime membership, writes Ahmed Asad . Asad: Obama is a constitutional lawyer of course and it8217s pleasant to imagine that he acted out of due regard for what Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution plainly states namely that 8220the Congress shall have power8230 amp160to declare war8221 to declare war . He says Obama was saying to Congress I8217m keen to launch a war of choice. But first I want you guys to okay it. Now in effect Obama is saying I8218m keen on launching a war, he wants to launch an 8220 shot across the bow8221 of the Syrian ship of state, he says. Now he wants Congress to OK it. Obama's invitation qualifies as beyond unusual and the president8218 . For example, the Arab League refused to allow US forces to allow its airspace access to Syria airspace .  Obama has implicitly opened the door for a Great Debate regarding the trajectory of US policy in the Middle East . The Senate and House of Representatives will likely be voting to approve or reject some version of an Authorization for the Use of Military Force AUMF at stake is much more than the question of what to do about Syria .

Despite troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan dropping sharply the Obama administration has still managed to spend more on the Pentagon than the Bush administration did during its two terms in office . The entrenched power of the arms lobby and its allies in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill makes it harder for members of Congress to consider cutting or slowing down even a failed or failing program . The strategic placement of arms production facilities and military bases in key states and congressional districts has created an economic dependency that has saved many a flawed weapons system from being unceremoniously dumped in the trash bin of history .

The overwhelming consensus in favor of a 8220cover the globe8221 military strategy has been broken from time to time by popular resistance to the idea of using war as a central tool of foreign policy is broken by resistance to use war as an alternative to foreign policy in foreign policy . The public is almost entirely on our own  The next major challenge to armed exceptionalism and to the further militarization of foreign policy came after the disastrous Vietnam War which drove many Americans to question the wisdom of a policy of permanent global interventionism .

Snowden has been working at the National Security Agency for the last four years . Snowden will go down in history as one of Americas most consequential whistleblowers alongside Daniel Ellsberg and Bradley Manning . The Guardian after several days of interviews read the full transcript of Edward Snowden’s identity at his request . Snowden is deeply worried about being spied on and has watched television and monitored the internet hearing all the threats and vows of prosecution emanating from Washington . He said he has no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong He said Snowden will be made to suffer for my actions but I will be satisfied if the federation of secret law unequal pardon and irresistible executive powers that rule the world that I love are revealed even for an instant . The Chinese government might whisk him away for questioning or he might end up being grabbed and bundled into a plane for questioning viewing him as a useful source of useful information . Snowden said he could be rendered up being seized and bundled in a plane bound for U.S. territory for questioning .

The golden age of the Jews8221 in America has passed its zenith, writes Richard Aaehr . He laments that with an intermarriage rate around 50 and a fertility rate of 16 children per Jewish woman Jews are committing population suicide8221 He takes a swipe at liberal American Jews most of them supporters of legal abortion . As Jews decline in number he points with a quivering finger at the Arab and Muslim population in America heading in the other direction he points at the Muslim population of America . He says that in the 2004 campaign four Jews gave over 80 million to Democratic political funds to the Democratic Party . In the history of giving a few individuals has not happened before this level of political political money of never happened before the countryIsrael is not a political issue but a few of them have given a few in the past . Baeh cites two academic studies putting the US Muslim population at between 18 and 29 million two thirds the size of the Jewish community . He also points out that the . total ArabMuslim community is about 35 million with the total Arab  There is good news and bad news about the decline of Jewish and proIsrael influence and the rise of ArabMuslim influence in the American political system are greatly exaggerated .

---  Five Afghans who returned home on the same flight as alJazeera journalist Sami alHaj and the other three prisoners described in my previous article the future is disturbingly uncertain . For the five Afghans who were released from Guant225namo they were not freed outright as was the case with the 152 other Afghans previously released but were instead transferred to Block D a wing of PoliCharki Kabul8217s main prison . In common with previous Afghan releases the identities of the five men have been difficult to establish The Pentagon never discloses the names of those it frees and although lawyers representing the prisoners are informed of their clients the identities remain unknown unless the media are present on their arrival which has not happened in Afghanistan for many years or until further investigation by lawyers or journalists turn up details of their identities . As with those described above their stories reveal yet again the wholesale mockery of justice that defines the regime at Guant225nomo remain unknown . Haji Rohullah Wakil is the most significant is 46year old Haji . Wakil a celebrated antiTaliban commander in Kunar province whose opposition to the Taliban was such that he fired the first salvo against the Taliban in October 2001 after the USled invasion in Afghanistan after the invasion in October  Sabar Lal who was finally freed from PoliCharki in February had no doubt that he had been betrayed by the Taliban . At Guant225namo he explained to his tribunal the injustice of imprisoning him with members of the Taliban at the hands of US forces . The story of the second Afghan Abdullah Mohammed Khan a 36year old ethnic Uzbek shifts the focus from Afghanistan to Pakistan and appears to be another example of dubious intelligence on the part of the Pakistani and American authorities . Khan denied knowing anything about any connection that Musa might have had with alQaeda saying that all he knew was that he came to Pakistan from Turkey with his family for medical treatment on his feet which were 8220in very bad condition8221 He also denied knowing about a CD containing explosivesmaking manuals that was apparently discovered in Musa8217s house . No attempt was made to verify whether or not they were true . No one has ever established the identities of the other 59 men who were falsely accused of the others who were accused of having links to alQaeda . Despite this both Farouq Saif and Mohammed alTumani remain in total against 60 prisoners in total in total of 60 prisoners who have been accused of spreading false allegations against 60 men in total .

The Tennessee Republican claims he wasn't privy to any inside information leading up to the sale of his stock in Hospital Corporation of America HCA weeks before the company reported lower than expected earnings July 13 that sent the stock south . The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the matter a spokesman for the senator said last week to determine if Frist broke any laws . Frist had attempted to have it both ways since he created his socalled blind trust in the 1990s being intimately involved with his investments that directly conflict with his political work as a senator and then claiming that he was totally unaware of his personal financial investments because it8217s in a blind trust . The mainstream media quick to accept Frist's statements that he had been in the dark about his HCA holdings was complicit in allowing the obvious conflict of having a senator who makes national decisions on healthcare that directly benefit the senator's fortunes and that of his family fall off the radar screen . In fact Frist knew of these sales or at least had access to information that these sales took place . The income from these sales of HCA stock was reported on his annual financial disclosure statements that Frist filed with the Secretary of the Senate  Senator Bill Frist has 89 percent of his assets tied up in HCA stock .

The Justice Department ended a 10year probe into how HCA defrauded the federal government and agreed to a 631 million settlement in the largest fraud settlement in US history . HCA paid 17 billion fines to keep one Frist out of jail making it the largest US fraud settlement ever . In February Frist instructed the trust administrator to unload his shares of his trust to sell his shares by the truckload prompting shareholders to raise questions on HCA boards to raise concerns about the company .

---  The New International Version of the Bible is by far the most preferred translation of the Scripture according to a new survey of US evangelical leaders . More than 65 percent of the participating leaders named the NIV as their preferred Bible in a survey conducted by the National Association of Evangelicals NAE . New Bible translations face large competition to gain a foothold in churches and homes but once established they have long staying power commented Leith Anderson president of the NAE which claims to represent 30 million evangelicals . The church failed to stand for the word of God It surrendered really without much of a fight and this is at the root why the church is so powerless today I found it very easy to memorize the KJB and spent a great deal of time memorizing the word during the late 1970s . The word is not in the heart Thy word Thy word has hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee against thee, says the pastor of a large church and I had an ugly confrontation with an assistant of a pastor who said he tells me he tells everyone to use any translation but he says he never heard anything about this revolution from the pastors I had contact with the pastors and said he was shocked to see a different translation .

The next revision of the Bible will be like Satan knew he could not gut the gutting the Bible as it would be too obvious so in the first edition so in one edition so many key verses and words that weaken faith will be deleted later the NIV is even politically correct and there will be even worse as there will even be even there to the next edition as there is no gender neutral and there is even a gender neutral edition .

---  Since the 1990s the U.S. has transferred large quantities of military materiel ranging from trucks and aircraft to machinegun parts and millions of rounds of live ammunition to Bahrain8217s security forces . The Pentagon has recently proven more powerful than American democratic ideals more powerful even than the president of the United States . A TomDispatch analysis of Defense Department documents indicates that the Pentagon and those oilrich nations have pressured the White House to help subvert the popular democratic will sweeping across the greater Middle East . The relationship represented by that bullet or so many others like it between Bahrain a tiny country of mostly Shia Muslim citizens ruled by a Sunni king and the Pentagon has proven more . than American democracy ideals . The US supplied Bahrain with enough 50 caliber rounds8212used in sniper rifles and machine guns8212to kill every Bahraini in the kingdom four times over .

The Pentagon in coordination with the State Department oversaw Bahrain’s purchase of more than 386 million in defense items and services from 2007 to 2009 the last three years on record These deals included the purchase of a wide range of items from vehicles to weapons systems .

The six Gulf nations along with regional partner Jordan are set to spend 70 billion on weaponry and equipment this year and as much as 80 billion per year by 2015 . The Pentagon is also the sole conduit through which its Arab partners in the Gulf can buy the most advanced weaponry on Earth by acting as a gobetween the Pentagon can ensure that the weapons manufacturers it relies on will be financially sound well into the future . Human Rights Watch reportedly strongarmed the White House by playing on fears that Iran might benefit if Bahrain embraced democracy and that as a result the entire region might become destabilized in ways inimical to US powerprojection policies . The White House has begun a review of its military assistance to the Bahrain regime . The British government suspended exports of any military equipment to Bahrain while France suspended its military exports while the UK suspended exports while France has suspended any military exports to the kingdom . The United States is however already deeply involved in the Bahraini uprising and has given a box of doughnuts to the other Gulf nations and given a lot of its own doughnuts .

Bush has done a clever job of manipulating the mass media but in reality his smooth imagery and downhome personality are severely undermining America8217s values . Bush does not seem to understand that while it is not a sin to be born to privilege it is a sin for spending your life defending it . Bush's economic policy which determines social policy is much like the iceberg waiting in the path of a steaming Titanic . The Bush tax and budget cuts were not made in order to jumpstart the economy or balance the budget they were simply massive cash transfers . Social programs are being slashed to pay for the war in Iraq tax giveaways for the wealthy and new defense contracts for arms makers who just happen to be big Republican campaign contributors . The administration has not provided the American people with a strategic vision as to how the War in Iraq and this excessive and bloated arms buildup fits into our larger defense antiterrorist and foreign policy . We have lost our moral compass as well as our national security and public institutions as a consequence of what is significant in both Iraq and foreign policies have suffered As a consequence as a result of the Bush administration has failed to understand the consequences in terms of human lives and

---  Nearly three out of every five parolees in Illinois are without work8212 with even higher rates of joblessness on Chicago8217s predominantly black South and West sides . More than half of all exoffenders in the state wind up back behind bars within three years of release . Employment is the most important factor in keeping exfelons from returning to prison but advocates say employers are still just too scared to hire them . Federal government incentives like tax credits for companies that take chances on excons have failed to drum up excitement . More common are employers who turn to criminal background checks to filter out such workers from the start . The number of background checks performed by state police hit at a 20year high this year this year state police has conducted 707544 checks the most it began performing them in 1984 and is rising so far this far this year . The retail industry has hired about 6600 workers in Chicago area which employs about 66000 workers in the Chicago area has hired around 6600 people in recent years . Ex-employees are more motivated and better overall temporary employees than the average of 30,000 people in the city of Chicago area . Exoffenders have never caused a major problem but none have ever caused a problem with employee theft .  Up to 5000 in federal bonding insurance to cover any losses incurred from hiring exoffenders . Just 14 of the policies were issued statewide in fiscal year 2004 which ended June 30 Advocates say increasing the benefits and programs may be one of the only ways to increase participation . Training the wouldbe workers themselves however remains a critical part of all major exoffender employment programs in Chicago . Exoffenders learn how to search the Internet for jobs prepare resumes and dress for interviews they coach them extensively on answering the one application question many of them dread the most 8220Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Safer Foundation says it instructs them to come clean 8220 Truth is the only way to get employers to hire them but getting our people to stay there That's an issue in itself. The first 30 days are the most critical time for nearly half of Safer's clients who are still with those same employers 30 days later . Most employers aren't tolerant of those who are not tolerant of workers who are repeatedly late or repeatedly calling their supervisors repeatedly asking them to show up for work without informing their supervisors or inform their supervisors for work . Most of the workers who have found better wages or don't have to call their supervisors without telling their supervisors about their supervisors .
---  Tuesday8217s announcement of the ObamaGeithner recovery plan is basically an extension of the BushPaulson plan . Smaller less troubled banks will be bought out by the large 8220troubled8221 ones to the personal financial benefit of their stockholders . Wall Street Journal oped page has provided enough hints trickling out for the past three months to tip the hand of Wall Street . Financial elites the problem is that it is not possible to inflate another bubble from today 8217s debt levels widespread negative equity and stillhigh level of real estate stock and bond prices . Financial power elite would love to recover The problem for them is how to start a new new bubble and make yet another new fortune and make another fortune yet the alternative would be to keep what they have taken and run and run. Discussions about emergency loans can improve on Citibank and Creditors have focused on putting enough emergency bailouts in place in place to improve on the emergency lending lending . The world is the real estate bubble, As I said above it was a golden age The financial and real estate and financial world and the financial and financial bubble is the global real estate . The real estate is the financial power elite . We are approaching Russian kleptocratic  Wall Street the banks and the other financial vehicles enrich the wealthiest 1 per cent and indeed the richest 10 per cent of the population . The first trick is to preserve the wealth of the creditor class 8211 Wall Street . Next comes an 8220aggregator8221 bank that sounds like 8220alligator8221 from the swamps of toxic waste to buy the bad debts and put them in a public agency . The harder part is to revive opportunities for creditors to make a new killing And it's the economy that8217s being killed Here I imagine how I imagine the plan might work . The government will swap 8220cash for trash for trash in exchange for the 500000 mortgage that is going bad heading toward only a 250000 market price . The PPP institution will start with say 3 trillion in funds and will have the power to buy and renegotiate the mortgages that have passed into the hands of the government and other holders . It will be financed with private funds 8211 in fact with the funds now being given to recapitalize America 8217s banks headed by the Wall St banks that have done so poorly .

---  Christopher Everard offers some answers to questions about a muchmaligned and often misunderstood Royal Family . The Queen uses the Christmas Day broadcast to make us think she is wholly British and a Christian . Her actual family come from Saxony and Bavaria and more of her ancestors are German than British . Her Christmas Day speech usually includes references to British religious landmarks such as this year's Reconciliation8221 . Her name is not 8216Windsor8217 but the royal family were known as the Dukes Kings and Queens of 8220SaxeCoburgGotha8221 In a time of brutal war with Germany the queen8217s grandparents and greatgrandparents created a fake name which they use to this day 8216WINDSOR8217 . Her money comes in the form of TAXES which are earned from millions of people and she also earns millions each year from her private estate which is centred on the county of Lancaster THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER . The queen hires and fires the head of the BBC and several other prominent jobs in Britain . Her family's financial affairs are forbidden from public discussion and she can recall and dissolve parliament whenever she likes . Her cousin is DAVID CAMERON and there are strong Germanic  Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs earned Her Majesty8217s Revenue 163660 billion pounds last year . Much of that tax comes from the People 8211 not Corporations 8211 who are often able to shutdown their parent company after three years and start trading under a slightly different name . This of course makes a mockery of the unwritten law that the wealthier of people in society contribute tax revenue in order to help the disabled ampamp elderly . Workers however on the PAYE system cannot take legal advantage of tax havens and have the indignation of a large portion of their salary being taxedstolen at source with not a jot of thanks from the Inland Revenue . Three of the Duke of Edinburgh's four sisters had married German princes three of whom became leading Nazis . The sinister Nazi connections come from three of the . sisters 8211 and that means that they were financing the killing machine which bred the killing machines which bred a 8216master race 8211 . The queen's immediate intermarried family plotted and conducted bombing raids and reduced the areas where poor people lived into rubble and wasteland . It was the queen8217's relatives who waged war on the people 8211 the POOR PEOPLE . She announced in her Christmas broadcast that she had been murdered or ordered the torture and execution

SAGE provides dental care free no cost to the patient at all in underprivileged underserved areas . Veterans dont get any dental care from the VA unless theyre 100 disabled . Medicaid covers some dental but only pretty much emergency stuff . They will cover a regular cleaning but they wont cover whats called a deep cleaning if you have gum disease or other cavities that arent hurting them right now but they will not cover that so either the patient or the patient has to pay for it . The mouth is obviously part of the rest of the body If you have infection and disease in your mouth then you have infections in the other parts of your body things like diabetes go up if you've gum disease heart disease go up . If you're two to three times plus more more likely to have diabetes you have diabetes . The same bacteria is the same plaque clogs your arteries and causes a heart attack or a stroke If the vessel goes to your brain it'll cause a heart itll cause a stroke if it goes to the brain it will cause a stoke If it goes into your heart it can lead to a stroke  SAGE is near the Mexico border and treats undocumented immigrants for free no questions asked . The organization is a nonprofit organization treating these people without having any coverage and not having to pay anything . A lot of them are scared to come out sometimes and go to a dentist or healthcare provider because they think they might be deported just by seeing a healthcare professional or by making themselves known. Theyre in a lot of fear very scared AARON MAT201: Weve already seen over 3000 patients. Im seeing these patients after hours and on the weekends of my private offices because SAGE does not have its own building yet I own two private offices . I think there should be a lobby that can effectively organize the needs of your patients who can say your needs and can say what needs your patients to say. I think patients should have accurate and appropriate representation because we have no insurance companies which are taking extra money which they end up taking up extra money to take up a kind of extra money and then they don’t have extra insurance companies. I’ve put everything in the same kind of money that they take up extra extra money. Ive put all of the extra money in the insurance industry’s not really taking up a lot extra money but the insurance companies

---  The world8217s leading oil producers were expected to bring fresh discipline to the chaotic petroleum market and spark a return to high prices . But far from restoring the old oil order the meetingamp160 ended in discord driving prices down again and revealing deep cracks in the ranks of global energy producers . The Doha debacle will perpetuate the low oil prices that have plagued the industry for the past two years forcing smaller firms into bankruptcy and erasing hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in new production capacity . It may also have obliterated any future prospects for cooperation between OPEC and nonOPEC producers in regulating the market . The failure of a November meeting has been widely attributedamp160to the Saudis8217 desire to kill off new output elsewhere8212and to restore their historic dominance of the global oil market . Saudi Arabia is now looking capable of weathering any price downturn than its rosy prediction is grimmer as the Saudi royals begin cutting back on any price cuts and finding themselves themselves .

The Saudis were also seeking to punish regional rivals Iran and Russia for their support of the Assad regime in  The Saudis rejected the draft agreement it had helped negotiate in Doha and the assembly ended in disarray . Most analysts have suggested that the Saudi royals simply considered punishing Iran more importantamp160 than raising oil prices . With the proposed agreement in tatters Saudi Arabia is now expected to boost its own output ensuring that prices will remain bargainbasement low and so deprive Iran of any windfall from its expected increase in exports . The kingdom is expected to immediately raise production from its current 102 million barrels per day to 115 million barrels and could add another million barrels in the next six to nine months . With Iranian and Iraqi oil heading for market in larger quantities that8217s the definition of oversupply it might also wound the kingdom in a major way if not fatally . The Saudi intervention has in fact failed to achieve its intended objectives though it has produced thousands of civilian casualties provoking UN officials and creating space for the al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . The prince seems determined to keep the conflict going and to counter Iranian influence across the region . For Prince Mohammed the oil market has evidently become just another arena for this ongoing struggle for this . For the Saudis the oil industry is being fundamentally transformed altering relationships among the major producers and eroding their inclination to cooperate .

---  Ralph Nader offers nothing but a protest vote for the candidacy of George Bush and for continued war at home and abroad . Nader stands for everything that a progressive voter could want in 2004 is to vote for Nader . The left made a mistake in 1992 with the election of Bill Clinton and went about our business figuring that we had a Democrat in the White House and so all would be well but he turned around and screwed us . The idea here is that by withdrawing our votes from the sellout Democrats and casting them for a genuine progressive alternative we force the Democratic Party to shift its position more to the left on a variety of issues . The problems with this approach are twofold and there is no mechanism for transforming the next presidential election is four years away and there are no mechanisms for the pressure of a third party to transform the party into a leftward swing vote in the 2004 election . If anything Nader created a toxic reaction to Bush to the same reaction can be expected in 2008, it might be expected to be even worse in 2008 and it might even be argued that another Nader vote could be argued for another 23 percent around Nader’s vote for Bush in 2008 . The same reaction is expected in 2004 could be expected only in 2008  The courts the election system and debates the media are rigged to keep third parties on the fringe . The likelihood of a third party fracturing into ineffective factions and selfdestruction before it could become a significant electoral force is almost 100 percent . John Kerry is belatedly going about trying to win that support of the antiwar movement . The only way we can see talk converted into actions will be if Kerry replaces Bush and we push him to do the right thing in office . We should face no power to influence this president and we should face that George Bush is no longer trying to influence the president . We never really pushed Clinton. We believed his blather or we were just too lazy or selfinvolved to challenge him and gave him a pass when he stiffed us . We must push him when he stepped down when he was in office. We have no influence to this president. We had no ability to influence George Bush. We need to try to influence his policies and we had no influence trying to change his change in education and change his education bill etc. George Nixon certainly certainly not trying to try and try to change Nixon. He certainly certainly is no trying and not trying trying and tried to change Richard Nixon’s change in his rush to war
---  Each was asked these questions: What do you consider to be the top two issues in the city of Rio Rancho and how would you address them . What qualities or experiences make you a better candidate to represent the city than your opponents . What should the city do to spur economic growth and attract new employers? How do you envision being a fulltime mayor? Here are their responses: R Morgan Braden, Gregg Hull, Carrie Davene, Carrie Carrie Dzezon, Carrie Hull and Kristopher Allen Kaylene . Gregg Hull: I will listen to our citizens who have a vested interest in our great city. I will have regular office hours where citizens can get hold of me I will attend city board meetings and assist our city council members and city manager with direction and fresh ideas to our city not the old and unproductive way that we have had in the past. I have had successes and failures and have learned from both I have a passion to make Rio Rancha the best place in New Mexico to live work and raise a family. I am personally opposed to raising any of our taxes. We need to work actively recruiting businesses both large and small Start by working with the state economic development board to keep up with companies interested in our area  Jim Owen is the only candidate for mayor that has not been mayor or run for public office so I bring a fresh new perspective to the office of mayor . The number one issue for Rio Rancho is our lack of economic growth . In order to provide the city services required to maintain and improve our quality of life we must increase our gross receipts tax revenue . The mayor is just part of the governing body and he needs to have the support and respect of the city council . I sold my business over a year ago and with no other distractions I am able to dedicate my full attention to this community . I have the proven relationships needed to engage and convince successful business organizations to come to the city . The city has the reputation for being the safest city in New Mexico but there is always room for improvement If we expand our gross revenue we will be able to properly equip and retain our public safety personnel without increasing tax increases without increasing taxes . I will work fulltime with the community and city council to implement jobcreator tax incentives . I would support an effective longterm bonding plan that provides for defined goals and completed projects optimizing the investment of the taxpayers . I am used to putting in long hours to achieve objectives and be successful as mayor. I have never embarrassed this city
---  Todays Powers That Be economic political and media are wrongly forcing a regime of austerity on our nation . Theyre insisting that we hoi polloi must downsize our middleclass dreams claiming that America no longer has the wherewithal to do big things . Far from shrinking down we have the economic strength today to be spreading the middle class and advancing the historic egalitarian ideals that were planted at Americas founding . In Washington on Wall Street and in the corporate suites the elites have taken exquisite care of themselves with theamp160 top one percent tripling their share of the nations wealth since 1980 . The massive redistribution of wealth is not an issue of economics but of basic morality in basic morality In plain words its robbery . In this country of unsurpassed wealth its an abomination that the power elites are casually tolerating poverty pay as our wage floor. Nearly four million Americans are being paid at or below the desiccated federal minimum wage of 725 an hour For a single mother with two kids thats 4000 a year beneath the poverty level . In most places even if youre single with no childrentry stretching that over the basics of rent utilities and utilities . Imagine that they can actually juxtapose the words working and poor without blinking much less blushing or barfing  The one simple step that would immediately add juice to the consumer economy which accounts for twothirds of Americas economic activity is to do the one thing that boneheaded lawmakers adamantly refuse even to consider . Raising the legal minimum wage to 10 an hour would elevate 30 million hardworking Americans now paid a poverty or nearpovertylevel income . The most important consideration in raising the wage floor the man from Bain Capital explained in a March interview is to keep America competitive by which he means Keep profits of speculative profiteers like him like Bain Capital high So that would tell you Professor Romney instructed that right now theres probably not a need to raise the minimum wage Unless of course youre a minimumwage family or the American economy . Mitt is merely mouthing the preposterous and perverse corporate line that lifting the minimum would hurt lowincome workers, says the prince of private equity Mitt Romney . In terms of what 10 buys this would lift the value of minimum wage only to what it was back in 1968 when worker productivity was only half of what it is todayamp160 Here is not a minimum wage . The percolateup solution would provide a huge and direct lift out of our present doldrums for those 30million hardhit people would .
---  In a blow to manufacturers Monsanto Co and BASF SE Arkansas state lawmakers voted on Friday to bar sprayings of a controversial weed killer after midApril to protect farmers from potential crop damage . The ban makes it less attractive for farmers to buy soybean and cotton seeds that Monsanto engineered to resist dicamba because the crops are designed to be sprayed with the chemical during the summer growing season . The United States faced an agricultural crisis last year caused by new formulations of herbicides . Farmers and weed experts said the products evaporated and drifted away from where they were applied hurting crops that could not resist them . Monsanto is banking on its dicambabased herbicide and soybean seeds engineered to tolerate it called Xtend to dominate soybean production in the United States the world8217s secondlargest exporter .

---  The eagerly awaited judgment in Writ Petition No50 of 1998 was delivered by the Supreme Court of India on August 09 2012 . The background of this petition has already been explained in detail in the piece titledamp160 The Orphans of Bhopalamp160that was published recently inamp160CounterPunch 1amp160 . The Scientific Commission submitted its report to the Central Government in July 1987 while the Commission was denied extension and was disbanded immediately thereafter the Report was not made public until about a decade later . Unfortunately the wellconsidered recommendations made in the8220Final Report on Medical Relief and Rehabilitation of Bhopsal Gas Victims were ignored by the Court at that time . However it is significant that after an avoidable gap of twentyfour years most of the recommendation made by DrSadgopal and DrDas in their Final Report have been accepted by the court in its verdict on the present writ petition . Most of the recommendations have been taken to task for its final Report have now been accepted in the verdict .

---  House members and the White House made seemingly contradictory claims concerning the Federal Drug Administration8217s blood donation policy for gay and bisexual men . Days after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando House members said the FDA's oneyear deferral policy or celibacy for men who have sex with men is based in fear and stigma not science . The White House said that the current policy does 8220rely on scientific advice rather than scientific advice . The FDA changed its original 1985 policy from a ban on any man who has had sex with another man since 1977 to a one year deferral . The revised policy also defers blood donations from a woman who has sex with anamp160MSMamp160for one year The FDA cites high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus or HIV in the MSM population as support for its oneyear deferredral policy . The CDC and AIDSgov also note that unprotected anal sex is the riskiest type of sex for HIV transmission in part because of the biology of the rectum . The U.N. explains that the term includes sexual acts between men who don8217t identify as gay or bisexual men in the United Nations as a sexual preference or sexual acts . Australia changed its policy between 1996 and 2000 .  The FDA is concerned with HIV transmission from MSM donors during the socalled 8220 window period when current tests often can8217t detect the virus in blood . The FDA says the rate of partner infidelity in ostensibly monogamous heterosexual couples and samesex male couples is estimated to be about 258221 The FDA also cites a condom failure rate of roughly 1 to 2 percent per episode of anal sex . Conversely many proponents of the individualamp160risk assessment for MSM blood donations argue MSM in monogamous relationships are at low risk for HIV transmission . We reached out to the FDA for clarification but have yet to hear back If we do receive a response we will update this article accordingly . In fact these advancements in HIV testing and other factors have reduced the risk of HIV transmission via blood transfusion from about 1 to 2500 to 1 to 1 million to 1, 2500 million in revised revised HIV transfusion to the revised revised blood donor testing since the 1980s in New York University and Columbia University respectively do address the FDA's proposed one proposed one-year deferral policy for MSM Blood Donor policy do not address the proposed one year deferral for HIV . We weren't able to independently verify infidelity rates in monogam monogamous samessex couples and heterosexual couples .

US officials are asking China to cut tariffs on imported cars allow foreign majority ownership of financial services firms and buy more USmade semiconductors in negotiations to avoid plans to slap tariffs on a host of Chinese goods and a potential trade war . US stocks surged on Monday on the news that the two sides were talking after a massive rout last week when Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on up to 60 billion of Chinese imports over alleged misappropriation of US intellectual property . China said it would treat foreign and domestic firms equally equally would not force force force not force domestic firms to transfer technology and strengthen intellectual property rights to strengthen its own technology and buy USmade products . US President Donald Trump and Chinas President Xi  A train believed to be carrying a senior North Korean delegation left the Chinese capital on Tuesday following a dramatic whirlwind visit that some reports said included the country8217s leader Kim Jong Un . The unconfirmed visit comes ahead of planned summit meetings with South Korean President Moon Jaein and US President Donald Trump . The White House has demanded that China cut its 375 billion trade surplus with the United States by 100 billion . China has a 25 percent tariff on US cars and has talked recently of lowering it while Trump has often complained that the US import tariff on passenger vehicles is only 25 percent China imports of USbuilt motor vehicles totaled 106 billion in 2017 about 8 percent of the country 8217s overall US imports by value according to US government data . China imported 26 billion of semiconductors from the U.S. semiconductor imports last year . It is unclear how US chips would replace South Korean and Taiwanese chips since there is minimal overlap between US chips and those of the two Asian producers . The United States accounted for just 1 percent of China’s total semiconductor imports . China can increase the regulatory burden on US companies through new inspections and rules ban travel ban travel stop providing export licenses of key intermediate goods . China could also inflict pain on US multinationals such as Apple
---  The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether chipmaker Broadcomamp160Ltd engaged in anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with customers . The investigation comes as Broadcom pursues a hostile takeover of Qualcomm in a 103 billion deal . Since the FTC would likely review any merger for anticompetition practices the current probe could make regulatory approval more challenging . ZTE has been banned from selling components to leading Chinese telecom equipment makeramp160ZTE Corp for seven years for violating the terms of a sanctions violation case US officials said on Monday . The ban is the result of ZTEs failure to comply with an agreement with the US government after it pleaded guilty last year in federal court in Texas to conspiring to violate US sanctions by illegally shipping US goods and technology to Iran . The Chinese company which sells smartphones in the United States paid 890 million in fines and penalties with an additional penalty of 300 million that could be imposed . US companies cannot export prohibited goods such as chip sets directly to ZTE or via another country beginning immediately . American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment which includes networking gear and smartphones and smartphones . The US action first reported by Reuters could be devastating to the ZTE since American companies  US chipmaker Qualcomm QCOMO will refile as early as Monday an application with the Chinese government to clear its 44 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors NXPIO sources said . Qualcomm withdrew its earlier antitrust application on Saturday at the request of Chinas commerce ministry just days before the regulators April 17 deadline to decide on the transaction expires expires . Analysts said a decision by Mofcom on the deal is unlikely to come before trade and investment tensions between China and the United States are resolved . Qualcomm has already received approval from eight of nine required global regulators to finalize the acquisition with Chinese clearance the only one pending . Qualcomm declined to comment but said the deal was unfounded and not related to the deal .

---  There are 175 million international migrants in the world each year . 175 million humans represents roughly 3 of humanity . The biggest concentration 561 million is located in Europe the second largest 497 million in Asia and only the third largest 408 million in North America . The modern nomad is moved about more concretely by the forces unleashed by the world capitalist system and not by some invisible hands . The colonial colonial 8216tendency8217 is still alive and kicking people8217s doors down just as shamelessly as was done in the good old times of the Romans and the Pharaohs . To this mass of humanity being thrust about the globe annually in search for jobs safety food shelter or food shelter humanity can still afford or cares to offer we must add the massive historical human displacements due to modernity8217 . To all of this a final footnote has to be added the covert interventions in the life of other nations something which the sedentary citizens of the First World nations are on average far more comfortable with than are the citizens of The Third World . These interventions produce nomads of various stripes from complete innocents all the way to the spooks . The Western world is moved around the globe by forces far more complex than those moving the traditional nomads  Traditional nomads the latter could easily be considered the happier of the two . This is not to say that nomadic tribes are fundamentally free from contradictions or incapable of violence . Violence is far less structurally necessary among the traditional nomads especially as they are situated in and surrounded by modernity today . The modern nomad by contrast has a better objective position to discern the arbitrary nature of the given rules of seeing through to the heart of the instability of the system the very instability that his modern sedentary cousins may take for 8216the creative powers of capital8217 and therefore mistake for the zenith of stability incarnate . Such was the dilemma for Pol Pot The answer to our modern riddle cannot be that simplistic. The real liberating questions cannot pose a false choice between capitalism in its different forms and adapting some precapitalist method in organizing modern life with all its complexities Such was Pol Pot . The truly liberating questions can't pose afalse choice between Capitalism in its various forms and adapts some precapsitalist methods in organizing Modern life with the complexities such as Pol Pot. Or is this a false question? To this man and millions like him both of all age groups of all ages of all genders and all race groups of both genders

---  The Great Law of Peace protects independence and individual liberty while bases decisionmaking on consensus rather rule rather than rule . Gandhi recognized this as the power of peace and applied it to create nonviolent civil disobedience that led to India8217s independence from British rule . The same force of peace that guided Gandhi to fight against the oppression of Britain was present at the beginning of the United States . Peace is a revolutionary force that largely remains untapped How can social movements be created by this innate transformative power and bring harmony to this divided world? We must overcome this loathing toward different views and work together to overcome this hatred that seeks to separate us. Peace is the foundation of America's radical acceptance of differences that recognizes all equally in uniqueness and accepts differences that recognize differences in uniqueness of the people we disagree with or condemn . Peace means to be at peace with one, even the opinions and viewpoints of those we disagree or condemn, says Frederick Douglass in his famous speech for the Fourth of the July 4th of the American Independence Declaration of Independence .
