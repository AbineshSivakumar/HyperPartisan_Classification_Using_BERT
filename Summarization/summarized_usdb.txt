We are also joined by the family members of Jaime Richardson his cousin and the first of the two officers involved in the death of Tyrone. We are happy to be able to talk to the family. We want to know why these two rogue cops were involved in this case. We need to find out why these rogue cops and why they were involved. We have to go on the streets without a death certificate.

---  Carter Page the Trump campaign8217s onetime volunteer adviser on Russia views with amazement how much a Democratic opposition research dossier has been embraced by the liberal power structure in Washington . He told The Washington Times that he is stunned because the dossier is 8220completely false8221 and 8220full of lies8221 about his supposed conduct visavis Russia last summer . Not one of the sensational allegations in the Democratfinanced memos from former British spy Christopher Steele has been verified independently at least publicly . The paper financed by Democrats via the opposition research firm Fusion GPS has been denounced as inaccurate by some former Obama administration officials . Mr Page runs investment firm Global Energy Capital LLC in New York City before that he was an investment banker for Merrill Lynch and spent three years in Moscow last decade making deals with Russian businesses . He has been doing exactly what thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton urged American entrepreneurs to do in 2012 as she stood next to thenPrime Minister Vladimir Putin in 2012 . In The Times interview Mr Page specifically rebutted all of the accusations concerning Mr Page . He said no one ever made such an offer to Mr Page or Mr Steele . Mr Steele also said he has never met Mr Sechin or Igor Divyekin a Russian official in Moscow .  Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence read portions of the Steele dossier into the record as certified facts on March 20 . Republicans are pressing the FBI for answers on what role the dossier played as the bureau made decisions to investigate and surveil Trump aides . The dossier appears to have made its way into intelligence briefings to Congress and then into news stories . Yet Mr Page watched with amazement as Democrats read parts of the dossier into record . Democrats offered no independent verification of Mr Steele's version of Mr Page's visit to Moscow with Igor Sechin and Igor Divyek . Mr Page told the Washington Times that he had never met with those two Russians and that he did not name the dossier in August . The Obama administration obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court warrant to surveil Mr Page as a foreign agent beginning in July This was about the same time the FBI obtained the dossier starting in July . Mr Steele wrote the dossier months before the Obama administration had announced the Russian government had announced that they were investigating Mr Page . The FBI had not identified the dossier as evidence to obtain a FISA court warrant for a wiretap on Mr Page in August. Mr Page said that he was not part of the Trump team’s team. The dossier appeared to be unproven
---  Tom Engelhardt: We owe Donald Trump a small bow of thanks and a genuine debt of gratitude . He says he's teaching us just how deeply disturbed our American world actually is or he wouldn8217t be where he is . Trump is a messenger from the gods the deities of empire gone astray, writes Engelhardt . He's a mess of contradictory beliefs and groups at each other's throats, he says . He is symptomatic of the nation he now leads, says Engelhardt, of the quagmire country he now represents . The United States is destined to go on killing ever more people producing ever more refugees and spreading ever more terror movements until the end of time . The U.S. is not the Romans not the British or the Romans had ever done anything in history in no way in a way in history, he writes. He says. We are destined to remain a great superpower for its remaining remaining for its own sake. It is not a great country for its future. It's not the future. We will never be able to dominate everything else in history. It will be the next great superpower. It was not the Roman Empire of the past. It has never been the Romans or its successors. It’s the Romans  Little Big Man was a man without shape and lacking all fixed ideas except about himself . His victory was in a sense a revelation that both political parties had been hollowed out as every Republican presidential candidate except him was swept unceremoniously off stage and out of contention in a hail of insults . American politics was visibly faltering and in the whirlwind a far wider range of Americans seemed in danger of going down too including Medicaid users Obamacare enrollees mealsonwheels seniors and food stamp recipients in what could become a slowmotion collapse of livable lives amid a proliferation of billionaires . Donald Trump has yet to appoint his horse or perhaps his golf cart as a senator or as far as we know commit acts of incest in the tradition of Caligula the first mad Roman emperor . Fortunately unlike every psychiatrist you haven't been examined I have no expertise in whether every psychiatrist has a diagnosis of a public figure you haven’t personally examined I’m not bound by the 8220narcistic personality disorder . I see no reason not a reason not to say the obvious reason not by the Goldwater Rule not by a public reason not for reason not reason not that he’s not bound to say ‘narcissistic personality’
---  India is in the grip of an extreme heatwave that has killed more than 1100 people in the past week . Anjali Appadurai is a member of the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice an international coalition of peoples movements around the world taking action on energy . D Raghunandan Rhagu is an expert on climate change and is trained as an Engineer Aviation and Social Scientist in India . He is also cofounder of the very recentlylaunched online political platform Tipping Point Collective. She has been organizing within and writing about international climate politics and the youth climate movement for several years. She says the majority of people of thisthe majority of this 1100 casualties of this heatwave were homeless people And the people who are affected first are people of lower incomes laborers who are expected to be working outside in the sunlight. The majority of those who are most affected by this heat wave were homeless People who are suffering from these extreme weather events were people of low-income laborers who were expected to work in the sun. The most of the casualties were those lower on the socioeconomic ladder affected first. Those affected first were low-on-the-struggling laborers who had to be expected to live in the heatwave. Those who are low on the   75 percent of the emissions in the atmosphere right now are the result of emissions from the industrialization of the West . Industrialization has gotten the socalled developed countries this is UN language the developed industrialized countries versus the developing countries the developed countries to the level of wealth and human development that theyre at right now . The world is still very much operating on a Western economic model DESVARIEUX Rhagu asks Rhagu about the Green Climate Fund and how underfunded it is . India needs to invest in which Western funding with Western funding could help with the transition to a lowcarbon economy . Rhagu says India is standing in the same queue as Burkina Faso asking for funds for funds . But there are fairly fairly large large ticket items of expenditure which India would take the lion share on a per capita basis but I think the dilemma does not stand in front of the African nations or allow the least the least African nations to allow some of the least of the developed nations or the least island states to allow it to allow for the least to stand in the front of front of line of the line or allow for some developed nations to stand on some developed countries . The most expensive proposition is a very expensive proposition which could do with Green Climate funding .

Gregory is the founder of Venezuelanalysiscom and the author of the book Changing Venezuela by Taking Power The History and Policies of the Chavez Government Verso Books He moved back to the US in 2008 because his wife was named Consul General of Venezuela in New York and he taught political science at Brooklyn College . He will soon be heading up the English website for TeleSUR which is a television network funded by Venezuela Bolivia Ecuador Argentina Nicaragua and Cuba . He has been working as a producer for The Real News since early 2016 he has been living in Quito Ecuador where he headed up the launch of teleSUR English and his wife took the position of Venezuelan Ambassador to Ecuador . He says he still tries to be as objective as possible because he has no hesitation to say the things that I think need to be said in the interests of Venezuela and the region the most and therefore I have no hesitation about what he thinks need to say about the recent events in the past year of the past month of the last year of this week . In Venezuela protests new protests are planned on Saturday The situation continues to be tense there Across the United States proopposition groups have called for  Eight Ch225vez supporters were killed in the process of those protests . inflation in the past year was 56amp160percent and crime was consistently high as well and there were more and more shortages in basic goods . Despite these problems poverty actually declined in 2013 . The United States has been accused of having their hand in this The Venezuelan government threw outwhat is it itthree consuls in the American Embassy in Caracas Kerry came out . President Obama came out and called for releasing some of the protesters that had been arrested . L243pez and Mar237a Corina Machado recognized this as an opportunity to basically organize a coup not necessarily against Maduro but actually a coup against Henrique Capriles I think one has been successful in elevating their own profile within the opposition at the expense of ruining the unity of the opposition . The students are essentially the students who actually follow the conservative or moderate student movements from private universities from the private universities in Venezuela . The Venezuelan student movement is divided between a left wing and a right wing and its certainly trying to lead the moderate student movement that is trying to follow the moderate or moderate moderate student lead of L243pererere . The student movement actually follows the liberal or moderate conservative or conservative student movement . The
---  Edward Snowden did not take all the NSA8217s classified documents with him when he headed for Hong Kong last June . Edward Snowden only downloaded a portion of the classified documents he took with him . The NSA is only one of 17 intelligence outfits in what is called the US Intelligence Community . The urge to envelop the national security state in a blanket of secrecy has proven essentially boundless as have the secret ambitions of those running that state . In the face of such boundlessness perhaps the words 8220whistleblower8221 and 8220leaker82218212 are no longer useful though we may yet have a word to describe what Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden have done we should stop calling them the creations of an overween national security State summoned by us to speak to them from its id . Imagine the unconscious societal societal societal unconsciousness in the way we can we speak to us, says TomDispatch' John Avlon . TomDispatch: "Imagine the feeling that thanks to Snowden and Snowden now we must grasp the depths of that state and Snowden are now the dark and the depths that we now grasp the depth of its secret appropriations are inconceivable without a state of its own document appropriations are in the process of documenting its own darkness and its own  The mania for secrecy has grown tremendously in the Obama years . Obama proclaimed a sunshine administration dedicated to 8220openness8221 and 8220transparency8221 That announcement drips with irony . The CIA takes 4 billion more out of the intelligence 8220 black budget than the NSA runs its own private wars and has organized its own privatized corps of spies as part of the general expansion of US intelligence and espionage abroad . In the Johnson and Nixon years we now know a staggering range of misdeeds committed in that era . Unfortunately there is no reason to believe that post-Watergate reforms of the pasts have made a thing of the nature of that era such as that 8217s. Unfortunately there8217s no reason that there is a reason to think that the reforms are a thing to believe the reforms that have been made in that way of that pasts. In the fact that postWatergate reform is no longer necessary to believe in that type of reforms that haven't been made such acts of the previous era of misreforms. In that era the accompanying technology could do so less In the current era of that8217’s ‘reforms’. In fact, there are no reasons to believe there

The question is: Are most Americans still in a country that would barely recognize a living in my parents living in a living country that has barely recognized my parents . I don't want you to think for a second that this represents some kind of elevated moral position on violence or horror it's a visceral reaction I actually wanted to see the baby monster in Alien burst out of that human stomach I just knew I couldn8217t take it In all my years of viewing and avoidance only once did I find a solution to the problem In the early 90s a . solution was to let my kids go first then take them back with me That way my . son could lean over and whisper 8220Dad in maybe 30 seconds the Velociraptor is going to leap out of the grass8221 My heart would already be pounding my eyes half shut but somehow cued that way I became a Crichten vet of the film I had been a Crchton vet of sorts .

The real power center in Washington has increasingly come to be located in the national security state and the allied corporate 8220 complexes8221 linked to it by that famed 8220 revolving door8221 somewhere in the nation8217s capital . The security state has embedded eyes and ears almost everywhere online and off here and around the world The NSA the CIA and other agencies are scooping up just about every imaginable form of human communication no matter where or in what form it takes place . Domestically the US has grown more militarized as police forces across the land heavily invested in highly militarized SWAT teams have donned more militarystyle uniforms and acquired armored cars tanks MRAPS drones and other militarystyle weaponry often surplus equipment donated by the Pentagon . There are now reportedly three to four million AR15 militarystyle assault rifles of all sorts estimated to be floating around the US there are now reports to be around the country . With all of this has gone a certain unhinged quality both for those SWAT teams that seem to have a nasty habit of breaking into homes armed to the teeth and wounding
---  Republicans have been publicly floating ways to chop social health care programs such as Medicare and Social Security under the guise that these programs account for much of the nations debt and even claim these programs will go bankrupt in the coming decades . A recently released report by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare examined the impact of raising Medicare eligibility age with and without the Affordable Care Act and the result is a huge increase in the number of uninsured persons . Dr Peter Arno is an economist and Senior Fellow and Director of Health Policy Research at the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a Senior Fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance . We talk about the difference with these costs with these as well as the difference between these costs and those of hospital emergency rooms and even the cost of providing care and not being reimbursed . We are joined by one of the studys authors Dr Arno at The Real News Network in Baltimore to discuss the impact on Medicare and the effect of raising the age of Medicare eligibility and the impact it would have on the elderly population . We also discuss the effect on the role of raising this age of eligibility for Medicare and other social security programs and the role it would impact older Americans directly because many of the .  Peter says Medicare for All is the only rational sane public policy solution to the future of health care in America . Republicans repeatedly make this claim that these programs are taking up a large chunk of our national debt socalled entitlement programs and also that they will go bankrupt the coming decades are a misnomeromer . Peter: We do have an assault on all these programs Medicare Medicaid and I believe soon Social Security as well . Peter says the Republican plan is to voucherize Medicare giving everybody a fixed amount of money to then purchase health insurance on the private market . The study that we did was focused specifically on raising the age in Medicare per se but I think its worth pointing out that even with the ACA in place the numbers the increase goes up 17fold with the Obamacare in place between what we have today and what would happen if their age is raised . Peter also questions questions about the cost of Medicare and Medicaid as well as the current cost of Social Security and the other programs as well. Peter: I really have to ask in terms of the cost the current Cost of Medicare. Peter. and Social Security at all at all Its worthwhile putting out a call out this statement that Jared Bernstein made a call for a call to call to reporters to call for policymakers to call
---  Our latest update shows corporations and stockholders still prospering under Barack Obama8217s presidency while the economy steadily adds more jobs and millions sign up for health insurance under Obamacare . But wages remain stagnant for those who have jobs and there are still 37 million who have been jobless for six months or more . US oil production is booming and dependence on oil imports is plunging but the national debt has now almost exactly doubled under this president and historically large deficits continue . This report follows our January 2014 update and previous quarterly reports dating back to our first 8220Obama 8217s Numbers8221 article in October 2012 . All figures here reflect the most recent available as of April 10 Affordable Care Act and the official enrollment period for obtaining private health insurance through the new exchanges has ended some more or less solid numbers are starting to come in . The exact total of people who have gained new coverage because of Obamacare isn8217t known but there is still no way to know that the exact number is between 58 million and 128 million and 58 million or 58 million people are expected to grow in coming months and that number is expected to rise . The unemployment rate stood at 67 percent which was 11 points lower than it was at its worst point during October 2009 and the unemployment rate  Theamp160total debt has gone up 998 percent since Obama took office rising to 126 trillion . The debt owed to the public has risen to 176 trillion an increase of 65 percent . Such large and growing federal debt could have serious negative consequences . The continuing deficits and high interest payments could slow down economic growth and even increase the risk of another economic crisis CBO said . The number of people in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program formerly known as food stamps has been declining as the economy improves and Congress enacts spending cuts . Gasoline prices have remained in check for the recent portion of Obama8217s tenure as president . Wind and solar power have more than tripled during Obama's tenure . US exports of goods and services have increased just 36 percent comparing the last three months of 2008 with the last quarter of 2013 with the final full quarter of 2008 just before Obama entered the White House . The US military has suffered a total of 155 fatalities in Afghanistan since Operation Enduring Operation Operation Freedom in Afghanistan . The Pentagon prefers to call 8220detainees 8220 Detainees and 8220Detainees, 8220 detainees. The US has suffered 155 fatalities since Operation Freedom of the Year in Afghanistan. The Pentagon preferred to call the US Freedom of Afghanistan 8220
---  Mother Jones obtained more than 450 requests for armored tactical vehicles from the Pentagon for what may be the most iconic piece of equipment in the debate over militarizing local police the mine resistant ambush protected vehicle or MRAP . In justifying their requests very few sheriffs and police chiefs cite active shooters hostage situations or terrorism as police advocates do in public . The single most common reason agencies requested a mineresistant vehicle was to combat drugs . A quarter of the 465 requests projected using the vehicles for drug enforcement and more than half indicated they were willing to deploy armored vehicles in a broad range of Special Weapons and Tactics SWAT raids . The requests flowed to a massive Pentagon program8212 known as the 1033 program that has given communities across the country a total of 56 billion in combat equipment left over from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan including a spokeswoman for the Pentagon said 625 MRAPsamp160A 2014 NPR analysis found that the Pentagon has also doled out 80000 assault rifles 200 grenade launchers and 12000 bayonets . The focus on drugs may owe partly to the fact the Pentagon originally launched the program to help local agencies fight the domestic war on drugs but the focus on the fact that the program was partly to help the domestic drug enforcement primarily for local agencies . The  Only a few dozen of the departments represented here have received an MRAP in response to their requests according to Pentagon data obtained by the New York Times and the Marshall Project . The documents Mother Jones obtained show that nearly all of these departments were placed on the Pentagon8217s national priority list of agencies in line to receive MRAPs as they return from overseas . Some of the agencies waiting in line however have a history of questionable SWAT operations Take the Kenosha County Sheriff's office which requested an armored tactical vehicle to use as part of a multijurisdictional SWAT team Two years after making its request several Kenosham County sheriffs joined the Department of Natural Resources in a SWATlike raid on a nokill animal shelter that was raising a baby deer . The DNR seized and euthanized Giggles . Some requests were simply odd In 2013 Police Chief Samuel Mackert of Dewey Beach Delaware asked for a Lenco BearCat According to a press release on Lenco's website, “It8217’s almost like driving a tank8221” In 2013 police Chief David Uhl from Dundee Michigan asked for an armored vehicle in part to secure the local Cabela 8217s a big box hunting
---  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to Congress on Tuesday . Ali Abunimah is cofounder of the awardwinning online publication the Electronic Intifada . Ali is author of One Country A Bold Proposal to End the IsraeliPalestinian Impasse . He says Netanyahu tried to present Israel as the modern rational democratic state and Iran as being a dark medieval violent ancient state He referred to the Persian bazaar as well as the Bible But of course the irony is that Netanyahu presented these Bible myths to Congress as if theyre real history . Ali says Netanyahu is appealing to the fear and hatred of Islam and Muslims that has been cultivated in the U.S. by many of the same members of Congress who are listening to Netanyahu to say its all this big morass and if we make a deal with Iran then were in effect supporting socalled militant Islam . The Beirut Star has apparently denounced that quote it is far as we can tell Hezbollah denied that Nasrallah said that . The editor of the Beirut Star apparently has not a correct translation and that the record is not a fact that he said that quote is not correct and that there is no fact that the editor of that said that he has ever said it is so far as to check into that quote that quote .  Paul says there are some fissures in the American approach to Israel that maybe we havent seen before . Paul says Netanyahu came to Congress to sabotage to sabotage the Obama administrations diplomacy with Iran It was very clear that the response from the White House was swift and harsh . The blame for that lies entirely with the American political establishment that has indulged Israel all along, Paul says . The Obama administration has sent time and again is Israel you can do whatever you want not just to the Palestinians but even undermine US plans and interests in the region and we will have your back. There will be no consequences. The money will continue The weapons will continue. The brandnew F35 fighter jets will be coming your way. So in that context why shouldnt Netanyahu behave this way? The responsibility comes back to Obama JAY And does it not also come back to the very basic approach of the United States to the Middle East? Paul says the U.S. policy assumes it must be the hegemon of the Mideast. Israel is something of an obstacle to its own imperial project in the US has decided for its own reasons that a rapprochement with Iran would be beneficial to its indususim . The US sees it effectively as a threat to its
---  Major General Charles Swannack Jr commander of the 82nd Airborne Division mentioned that corner in January 2004 . The phrase was used by Americans to describe the glide path to victory in that conflict and would long be associated with the commander of US forces General William Westmoreland . But despite President George W Bush's unforgettable May 1 2003 8220 mission accomplished mission accomplished, the American war in Iraq somehow never actually stopped . American troops found insurgents armed with rocketpropelled grenades RPGs and other weaponry sometimes even Americanproduced arms . The streets around that corner turned out to be pitted with halfburied improvised explosive devices or IEDs those same insurgents could build from instructions on the Internet and that could destroy the most wellarmored Humvee for the price of a pizza . The infamous 8220light at the end of the tunnel8221 was also occupied by a range of top US officials from President Lyndon Johnson to National Security Advisor Walt Rostow to find a dark tunnel where just the light at its end it was easy enough to imagine a train bearing down on you . For all those in the antiwar movement of that losing war those who weren't just heading for you weren’t heading for the corner were always heading for just the dark inside a dark  Is it possible that some 14 years late America8217s missionaccomplished moment is finally arriving in Iraq? Some of the good news in full view . US troops are actually being drawn down in Iraq and a mere 14 years after that missionacomplished moment some of them are evidently being sent to the place where that cornertobeturned still evidently stands . For America's warfighting generals and other key officials there have always been corners to turn beyond compare in the years leading to Washington 8217s 8220victory . Here 8220We8217ve won in Iraq8221 he said without hesitation or qualification. about that walk to the corner just not in Iraqamp160 I8217m just talking about glimmers and8230 oh wait I should mention one more thing in neighboring Syria all aglimmer itself these days the US is now seemingly on the brink of involvement in a whole new war between NATO ally Turkey and the Kurdish forces it8217t war between Turkey and Iran also seems to be lurking just around the next turn of the Trumpian corner . Here is a partial list of officials since at least 2010: US Afghan commander General Stanley McChrystal in February 2010 the US had 8220turned the corner8221
---  Maya Ludtke was an abandoned baby girl in eastern China when the one child policy and a traditional preference for boys landed her in an orphanage . Maya was part of a huge wave of Chinese adoptions 8212 some 80000 into the U.S. and 40000 elsewhere . Some 50 million Chinese girls who were given away killed in infancy aborted or abandoned or abandoned . Maya's adoption agency put Melissa in touch with an adoption agency that brought her to China and put ninemonthold Chang Yulu in her care Chang became Maya and Maya grew up as an American girl in Cambridge Massachusetts . Maya is now a 19-year-old college freshman teaming up with her adopted mom journalist journalist Melissa Ludkke to tell the story of her search for identity in China . Melissa and Maya return to the village of her birth to see what her life might have been like had she stayed in the village where she had been born . The one-child policy and attitudes toward women and girls drove a wave of some 120000 international adoptions in the United States and Maya is a Chinese fandancer and a Chinese fan of the Chinese part of the American part of her identity . Maya and Melissa are now a college freshman she8217s teaming  The stories photos and videos from that threeweek trip became the backbone of the multimedia project 8220 Touching Home in China8221 which Melissa has been developing both as an ebook and as a curriculum for schools and community colleges . Melissa says this story can be a powerful tool to help immigrants all over America into society and into higher education . Mei Fong a former Wall Street Journal correspondent in China and author of the book 8220One Child China8217s most radical experiment8221 says she can relate to the unwanted girls in China . Me Fong author of One Child Chinas Most Radical Experiment says attitudes about women and girls have been changing fast as China modernizes modernizing modernizes its modernized modernizing its rural villages . She says the positive side of this challenge is facing this challenge and challenges the challenge of gender balance in China's gender balance . The story is a challenge to the future of the one-child policy in the onechild generation of boys and young men to find wives and young women in the rural areas of the country . The stories are part of the project and the one child policy that led to some 50 million missing girls under the 30-year-old policy that has led to more girls being aborted or abandoned .
---  Vijay Prashad is the Executive Director of the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research and is also chief editor of LeftWord Books Vija He is the author of over 18 books among them The Death of a Nation and the Future of the Arab Revolution University of California Press 2016 Vijay joins us from Northampton Massachusetts . Vijay is the George and Martha Kellner Chair in South Asian History and professor of international studies at Trinity College His most recent book is The Poorer Nations A Possible History of the Global South . We take a close look at the presidents speech and what he did and did not say Wednesday morning is our guest Vijay . We also take a look to what the president mapped out of what he said about his strategy for defeating ISIS in the U.N. President Obama addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday morning . We hear the president say we need to be more forcefulforceful but also at the same time hes saying that the international community has failed to enforce international norms . We heard the president talk about no ground troops on the ground were going to be on the air strikes in Syria . We will also hear how the president said that he wants the world to join the international coalition to degrade and destroy ISIS .  UN Ambassador Samantha Power made comments about the administrations strategy of arming moderate rebel opposition . Samantha Power said that the U.S. has failed to produce a substantial armed opposition group that they would consider to be moderate . Vijay says the credibility of the strategy strikes me as not very well worked out if you look at it from the ground upwards Vijay does you think this strategy is a good one at the end of the day Vijay also says that the president is talking about ending the hypocrisy of those who accumulate wealth through the global economy and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear down the wealth . The president also talks about cutting off the funding for those that that fuels this violent ideology . The Obama administration hasnt really laid out what they mean by moderate opposition You know who are the principal partners on the ground Who is going to among the groups that are there now be recognized as moderate? Vijay. Well I mean how there is socalled private funding for al Qaeda in Iraq was an early point in the career of the Islamic State of alQaeda in the early point of its early career in Iraq and how it was at an early stage in its career of al Qaeda. The president reads The Wall Street Journal. This is how it is
---  Three gunmen barricaded themselves inside a San Diego bank in a suburb of San Diego on June 12 2012 . The police requested air support from the Pentagon and an F15 dropped two GBU38 bombs on the bank leaving the building a pile of rubble All three gunmen died . The events that followed 8212 now known to everyone thanks to 247 news coverage 8212 shocked the nation . Just over a week ago an analogous 8220incident8221 did happen in Afghanistan and it passed largely unnoticed here . American and Afghan forces surrounded a house in a village in Logar Province south of Kabul where a wedding ceremony either was or would be in progress . In late December 2001 according to reports a B52 and two B1 bombers using precision bombers wiped out 110 wedding revelers in a small Afghan village using precision weapons piloted out of 112 wedding reveliers in a . small Afghan Afghan village . The American drone has been wiping out a small number of people out of their homes sometimes in similar fashion sometimes in Pakistanis and until relatively recent numbers . For more than a decade they always always always struck . Cumulatively indicate they indicate one thing for the value of the life of the Afghan Afghan life was out of the future . For example they indicate that they indicate they are striking  The Logar bombing in Logar Province has even noted that this is not the first time part of an Afghan wedding party has been taken out by the US Air Force . Afghan President Hamid Karzai has bitterly complained about similar air strikes that kill and wound civilians in or near their homes and repeatedly demanded that they be stopped . The Afghan War has given a different meaning to the ceremonial phrase 8220till death do us part8221 The Country Crasher . In this case however however the Afghan president who lacks much real power hence his old nickname 8220the mayor of Kabul8221 seems to have the wind at his back . The Obama administration is on edge about its disintegrating relations with Pakistan thanks in part to its unwillingness to offer an apology for crossborder US air strike that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers last November . Perhaps because the list of recent US blunders and disasters in Afghanistan has grown long and painful 8212 the killing of civilians in Afghanistan is growing long, painful and painful . The list of US blundered and painful has grown to include urinating on bodies of dead enemies and the burning of Korans by one American soldier the slaughter of 16 innocent villagers by one U.S. soldier . The rise of greenonblue violence that is Afghan army
---  It was 14 years ago that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs government was overthrown by General Pervez Musharraf in a military coup . Prime Minister was arrested and later exiled to Saudi Arabia after being overthrown . Now he is back in government and is likely to negotiate with Taliban groups operating inside Pakistan to bring an end to the regular bomb attacks and violence that have plagued the country for years . The military is immensely powerful in Pakistan with vast economic interests and huge political influence . But the military is expected to be more receptive this time round tempered by his previous experiences and the military will be more tactful this time round . Nawaz has pledged to bring end to US drone strikes in Pakistan . The wheels are already rolling in the process because they wouldnt have to deal with it because they do not have to make sure that they would be the beneficiaries of this peace process because of the wheels are rolling on the right direction . Pakistanis are also likely to be under pressure from the international community and the U.S. will also need to leave Afghanistan by the end of the drone strikes . The Taliban have clearly asserted that they see democracy as antiIslam and they are not a very popular issue that not a popular issue over that issue .  Talat Hussain believes Nawaz Sharif certainly has options but whether he takes them or not is a different matter . The 63-year-old veteran politician is also one of Pakistans wealthiest industrialists . He likes grandiose projects which are eyecatching but ultimately benefit relatively few like his plans to build a bullet train service across the country and the motorway he built during his previous administration . Hussain says Nawaz will also have to fine tune quite a lot of how he conducted the foreign policy because the imperative of public pressure and delivering services to the people is too much gone are the days when you would look at foreign governments saying do this or dont do that . Hussain believes the new government will have a fierce political competition like Imran Khan now in the opposition like the new administration . The dichotomy will have to take to the economy seriously reviving reviving the economy and reviving it . Both the national economy which are very important for the present leadership of the present Pakistan is very important to be the very important national economic competition for both the present Naz and the present leader of the Muslim League League . The Muslim League is a very important part of the national leadership of Naz Sharif is very very important in the present government of Pakistan .
---  On Friday the interAmerican committee on human rights announced it was going to take up a case of a prisoner at Guantanamo . This is the first time an international body which analyzes human rights has accepted a case on a Guantanamo detainee . Djamel Ameziane a citizen from Algeria who has been detained in Guantanamo for ten years without charge or trial This is a case about right to a fair trial and the prohibition of torture And also through this case we are looking for accountability for those people responsible of committing this acts . Now joining us to talk about this is Francisco Quintana Hes deputy program director for the Andean Caribbean and Americas region for the Center for Justice and International Law . The case was presented four years ago and after extensive review of all the information that we presented last Friday this international body decided to admit the case . And now we are going to move into the second stage of these proceedings. The commission is going to review all our arguments regarding unfair trial torture and also the mistreatment that he has received and how this has affected him psychologically and also his family how his family has been crosstalked . And the United States has a legal obligation to comply with the decision of the commission. And the decision is not completely revealed and that is  Djamel Ameziane is only one of the cases that the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights has knowledge about Guantanamo . He is from Algeria and he fears repercussions if he returns to Algeria . He fears persecution because of the226128148when he first fled from Algeria in the year 2000 there was political turmoil that was also related to his religious beliefs in Algeria . Paul Paul says the decision will be a landmark that we can use to talk to other governments or talk to the United States Congress in order to do the necessary modifications through cases decided at the commission or can ask also for reparations for society . Paul says it will create an international precedent that can be used in the judicial system within the U.S. Can it be used to overturn laws and overturn laws that were created by the Argentinian Supreme Court in Peru to overturn the laws and these precedents on some cases that were litigated against some of some of the laws that dealt with some of Peruvian laws and were overturned in some cases in Peru . Paul: We just give you just an example of a couple of years ago in an Argentinian court to overturninian laws that was used in a case that was litigated by the Supreme Court to overturning some of these laws .

Up to 5000 European jihadists went to Syria to fight in Western Europe . President Barack Obama discusses unfolding events from a baseball game in Havana Cuba with ESPN allies . Leftwing racial agitator Sunny Hostin said I am so tired of seeing this senseless death I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today because we need to be forceful we cant have these muted responses to terror I thought Hillary Clinton came out with what seemed to be a very muted response . Hostin continued in crediting Trump with speaking about Islamic enclaves deemed as nogo zones in the Belgian capital . Hillary Clinton claimed to have assisted in guiding President Barack Obamas gutsy call to liquidate Osama Bin Laden . Senator Bernie Sanders called for international unity to combat ISIS in a short statement about the attacks in Belgium 8217s capital city . The city has now shut down subway transportation . The airport has been shut down and the airport has now been closed down . A third bomb was found at the airport  The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg defends his leaders honor in the face of criticism from a somewhat hawkish national security intellectual . SITE intelligence group head Rita Katz says ISIS will claim responsibility for the Islamic terrorist attacks in Brussels . The split screen now running on CNN tells you everything you need to know about Obamas foreign policy according to Goldberg . CNN reports that French authorities need about 25 agents per Islamic terrorist for the purposes of monitoring and surveillance . Former DHS head Michael Chertoff claimed that lack of assimilation of Muslims was a driving force behind Islamic terrorism . The idea that you can identify people who are at risk for becoming Islamic terrorists based upon their religion or the way they look is completely fallacious . Karl Rove asserts that American authorities are effective at screening persons who enter the country lawfully He then claims that the Islamic attacks in NATO are evidence of the essentialness of NATO . The Islamic terrorist attack in Brussels is proof that the attacks in Belgium are proof that NATO is capable of preventing Islamic terrorists returning to France after assisting Jihadist movements like ISIS . The Huffington Post says that this amounts to thousands of agents across Europe for this purpose knowing that thousands of Islamic terrorists return to France for this reason . CNN's Peter Bergen a terrorism analyst with leftwing CNN says that

---  It was 14 years ago that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs government was overthrown by General Pervez Musharraf in a military coup . Prime Minister was arrested and later exiled to Saudi Arabia after being overthrown . Now he is back in government and is likely to negotiate with Taliban groups operating inside Pakistan to bring an end to the regular bomb attacks and violence that have plagued the country for years . The military is immensely powerful in Pakistan with vast economic interests and huge political influence . But the military is expected to be more receptive this time round tempered by his previous experiences and the military will be more tactful this time round . Nawaz has pledged to bring end to US drone strikes in Pakistan . The wheels are already rolling in the process because they wouldnt have to deal with it because they do not have to make sure that they would be the beneficiaries of this peace process because of the wheels are rolling on the right direction . Pakistanis are also likely to be under pressure from the international community and the U.S. will also need to leave Afghanistan by the end of the drone strikes . The Taliban have clearly asserted that they see democracy as antiIslam and they are not a very popular issue that not a popular issue over that issue .  Talat Hussain believes Nawaz Sharif certainly has options but whether he takes them or not is a different matter . The 63-year-old veteran politician is also one of Pakistans wealthiest industrialists . He likes grandiose projects which are eyecatching but ultimately benefit relatively few like his plans to build a bullet train service across the country and the motorway he built during his previous administration . Hussain says Nawaz will also have to fine tune quite a lot of how he conducted the foreign policy because the imperative of public pressure and delivering services to the people is too much gone are the days when you would look at foreign governments saying do this or dont do that . Hussain believes the new government will have a fierce political competition like Imran Khan now in the opposition like the new administration . The dichotomy will have to take to the economy seriously reviving reviving the economy and reviving it . Both the national economy which are very important for the present leadership of the present Pakistan is very important to be the very important national economic competition for both the present Naz and the present leader of the Muslim League League . The Muslim League is a very important part of the national leadership of Naz Sharif is very very important in the present government of Pakistan .
---  For almost 50 years the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have been in one level of warfare or another with the government of Colombia . Now there is again talk of a peace process in Colombia . Forrest Hylton Forrest is an associate professor of history at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogot195161 . He was recently awarded a postdoctorial fellowship at New York University . Forrest is the author of several books including Evil Hour in Colombia Vanishing Acts A Tragedy and coauthor of Revolutionary Horizons Past and Present in Bolivian Politics . He says the FARC at the highest levels is in favor of advancing some kind of peace negotiations with the current government Its not clear how far the process is going to get before an election although if Santos were able to make any kind of progress towards peace before the elections in 2014 that would certainly guarantee his reelection . The FARC has made it clear at least in his public statements that he thinks the time has come to begin negotiating, but he has made a decision on how much political capital he would be willing to risk it if he wants to risk risk of risking his political capital to make a deal with the peace process before the election in 2014 . For more information please contact The Real News Network on iReport.  The FARC was linked at the hip with the Colombian Communist Party for a very very long time which is to say for most of its existence . They were considered for better or for worse to be a component of the Colombian left in the decades when such a thing existed . But theres really almost nothing of a Colombian left to speak of and the FARC certainly are not part of it In fact they are one of the reasons why the nonarmed left is so weak in Colombia because the paramilitary right is armed to the teeth and linked to military intelligence as well as other instances of the military and police . Santos is however quite different than Uribe in terms of being willing to negotiate with the guerrilla guerrilla guerrilla guerrillas under certain conditions as it was very difficult to imagine under conditions under which conditions under . Uribe would have negotiated other than surrender JAY . Santos broke with the US on the issue of Cuba at the Summit Meeting of the Americas Meeting of Latin America at the U.S. of that left and also stayed in solidarity with the rest of the . of that . of Cuba . of the United States at the summit of the Summit of . the . Americas Meeting Meeting of Americas . of Americas meeting with the United Nations of the South America .
---  Former State Dept. diplomat spent 12 months in Iraq in 20092010 as part of the American occupation . Iraq had already been tacitly divided into feuding statelets controlled by Sunnis Shias and Kurds . Baghdad government had turned into a typical thirdworld thirdworld democracy fueled by American money but with a particularly nasty twist they were dedicated to persecuting marginalizing marginalizing the minority minority group group . Iraq's Shia government in Baghdad was hellbent on ensuring that there would be no Sunni in its Iraq . The staggering costs of all this8217 was 32 billion to train the Iraqi Army for the reconstruction for 32 billion more than 32 billion dollars . The overall war for reconstruction was almost 4500 Americans ampn8217 for the overall war and more than 4,500 Americans dead and more more than 2,500 for the total dead Americans . The Grandsons of Evil in the Axis of Evil, the most powerful foreign power in the world had been built in the moment of imperial hubris of the empire of Imperial hubris and the most influential foreign power was the Iran-backed regime of Saddam Hussein . The US government had once been determined to take down alongside Saddam Hussein as one of the Bush administration had once be determined to topple Saddam Hussein and the  The truth on the ground these days is tragically familiar an Iraq even more divided into feuding statelets a Baghdad government kleptocracy about to be reinvigorated by freeflowing American money . Brett McGurk who served in key Iraq policy positions throughout the Bush and Obama administrations is again the point man as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iraq and Iran . Obama hardly can be blamed for all of this but he8217s done his part to make it worse and worse it will surely get as his administration once again assumes ownership of the SunniShia fight The 8220new8221 unity plan that will fail follows the pattern of the one that did fail in 2007 use American military force to create a political space for 8220reconciliation8221 between onceburned Sunnis and a compromise Shia government that American money tries to nudge into an agreement against Iran 8217s wishes . The State Department still stays hidden behind the walls of that billiondollar embassy, the U.S. is still hidden behind that billion dollar embassy and the mercenary security contractors are all familiar names mostly leftovers from the glory days of the 2003 invasion of 2003 invasion . The Iranians have the same military commander on the Iraq War . The Iranian forces are already there
---  When men first made war in the air the imagery that accompanied them was of knights jousting in the sky . These days we need a new set of terms to explain what US air power actually does . American 8220air superiority8221 in any war the US now fights is total In fact the last time American jets met enemy planes of any sort in any skies was in the First Gulf War in 1991 and since Saddam Hussein's once powerful air force didn't offer much opposition . The last time US pilots faced anything like a serious challenge in the skies was North Vietnam in the early 1970s . The Valor of Pilots in the US military today is to be in staggeringly less danger than any American who gets into a car and heads just about anywhere given this country8217s annual toll of about 34000 fatal car crashes . In addition there is far less difference than you might imagine between piloting drone aircraft from a drone aircraft and fighter jets are flying their planes are fighting Hellfire missiles thousands of miles away in the cockpit of a fighter jet or in the United States or flying over Afghanistan in the U.S. military today . There are no obvious conclusions drawn from the obvious conclusions that the obvious dangers of war are never drawn from it  American air war as it has developed since World War II is a long path from knightly aerial jousting to air war . We have no language for it because accurate labels would prove deflating pejorative and uncomfortable . We don't imagine our form of warfare as like that of the Predator that alien hunter of human prey or a Terminator that machine version of the same . And because of that it is almost impossible for Americans to imagine how Americanstyle war must seem to those in the lands where we fight amp160 . The crucial thing to keep in mind is that no matter how many apologies may be offered afterwards this can8217t stop . Afghan civilians have repeatedly even repetitiously been blown away from the air with or without apologies since 2001 . In fact Afghan participants at wedding parties funerals and other rites have for example been wiped out with relative regularity only sometimes with apologies to follow . In the weeks that preceded the killing of those boys for instance a 8220NATO82218212these are usually American8212air attack took out four Afghan security guards protecting the work of a U.S. troops . These are usually U.N. troops with guns and other potential target peoples those drones buzzing in the sky must seem very much like re

The hearing will be on that It will also be on this proffer of some kind of plea to a lower charge than the charge than hes been charged with Well see what happens Itll be going on in Fort Measeade next week The interesting thing of course is Bradley Manning has now been in custody as I said for over 1000 days Hes one of the two major sources apparently alleged sources for my client Julian Assange and Jeremy Hammond . The other source226128148is Jeremy Hammond. He is alleged to have cracked into the Stratfor emails of which there 5194amp160million uploaded them to WikiLeaks Stratfors a private intelligence company WikiLeaks had been putting them up regularly The latest group of them has to do with Latin America correspondence back and forth with various people in Latin America . Julian Assange in the Ecuador embassy .  WikiLeaks is the only one of four groups singled out with RATNER . The group of people who I represent and are out there doing a lot of work Anonymous and others they want transparency they want openness They believe that democracy needs transparency . The only people the government wants open are you and me and whatever we do on the internet In fact the opposite should be there We should have privacy and governments should be transparent So you have a judge sitting on the case where her husbands email even though it was a public email was revealed by a hacker because it was part of the Stratfor intelligence system . The judges husband is at a law firm called Cahill Gordon in New York and his email was one of the emails hacked and revealed by Stratfor or allegedly by the defendant sitting in the courtroom of the woman whose husbands email was looked at226128148 .

---  Avigdor Lieberman should be denounced by all means but it is certain that the problems attaching to his name are not going away . Three years ago Lieberman proposed annexing to the northern West Bank parts of the Galilee with large Arab populations . At the heart of this region is Wadi Ara described in a US media account a few years ago as 8220a seasonal riverbed adjacent to the West Bank with a majority Arab population . This echoed Irving Howe's suggestion in The New York Times Book Review that more Jews be sent to the 8220underpopulated Galilee . In 2006 Henry Kissinger enthusiastically endorsed the idea without mentioning Lieberman by name . The rejection of such an approach which would contribute greatly to stability and to demographic balance reflects a determination to keep incendiary issues permanently open, Incendiary issues8221 no doubt include Wadi Arba . In Israel the Palestinian Authority would still be the former Arab citizens would still belong to the former Israeli Arab state however they wouldn still be annexed Israeli state . The former Arab state would still own the former Palestinian Palestinian Authority and their former Israeli state would be the boot of the US puppet state . In the same time Kissinger wrote his Israel National News reported that Otniel Schneller Kadima member Otnie Schneller  A Palestinian ghetto would exist alongside a Jewish state which would of course include the settlements . The demographic problem8221 bedeviling Zionists has bedeviled Zionists ever since two rabbis returned in the 19th century with the report that the bride was 8220beautiful but married to another man8221 . Such development is open forever only to Jews 4 And so amidst much celebration handshakes on the White House lawn etc the new 8220twostate8221 solution could well be realized in the notsodistant future . The new Israeli state would be a Palestinian ghetto alongside the Jewish state . Palestinian embroidery would be sold at appointed places to adorn the persons and furniture of pure Jews commuting back and forth to a now purely Jewish Jerusalem and Tel Aviv from say purely Jewish Maale Adumim . American readers wearing exquisite Navajo turquoise jewelry 8211 will recognize these images . President Obama is turning out to be more of the same.

---  William J Astore: America8217s military academies are supposed to educate and inspire leaders of strong character and impeccable integrity . He says the US military has not had a convincing victory in a major war since 1945 . America's most senior military officers many of whom are academy graduates have consistently ignored or misapplied the words of Jefferson . The academy's mission is to turn raw cadets into career officers dedicated and devoted to their particular branch of service . Despite the presence of a Cadet Honor Code the humanities and questions of ethics play too small a role in the intellectual and moral development of the students . The academic curriculum is structured to prepare cadets for the technical demands of their first jobs meaning that it is heavily weighted toward STEM sciencetechnology engineeringmath . The Academy system rewards energetic displays to generate mediocrity and the idea of conformity also tends to generates mediocrities as well as cynicism . The academies don't always make good people better people better than they turn off a few of their peers. The Academy Academy boys got coveted slots but were generally hated by their cynical peers . The Academies are considered to be perverse in the eyes of officialdomdomdom. Academy boys. The academy boys are considered as rectitude  America8217s senior military officers too often become tools of the armaments industry his 8220militaryindustrial complex . The military academies fail to curb this behavior but essentially encourage it they are failing our democracy . The classic civilianmilitary nexus which was supposed to serve and promote democracy has turned out to have a few glitches in our time should surprise no one . The system of selfperpetuating and selfserving militarism rather than military service is failing democracy, says TomDispatch . The case of Chelsea Manning to lowly privates for straight talk and the courage to straight talk to the buck to buck the buck system is not up for consideration, says Eric Shin: "This is not to suggest that the military lacks integrity in the way of General Eric Shinki" The system lacks integrity, says Shinki. It lacks the integrity of the way that the system in General Shinki’s General Shin. It is the way the system lacks the ability to take responsibility or take responsibility for any reasonable measure of responsibility or in protest,” says Shiniki. “The buck stops here8221 the buck. The buck never stops with them” – says Shinik. The system is the system of Americanstyle stabintheback”
---  During the 2016 election campaign Donald Trump repeatedly emphasized that our country was run terribly and needed a businessman at its helm .

Now give him credit as president The Donald has done just what he promised the American people he would do run the country like he ran his businesses . He escaped relatively unscathed financially while his investors and countless workers and small businesses to whom he owed money were left holding the bag . As president he has also begun to isolate our country from the global economy essentially pushing other nations to engage in more trade with each other not the US not the United States . Trump has seemingly forgotten that diplomacy and trade matter to the actual American economy . He has forgotten that diplomatically and trade matters to the real American economy rather than the actual US economy . The president is now advocating the very policy he railed against in the West Wing is now promoting tax reform for megacorporations and the tax reform he is neglecting the white working class that he was championing the everyday man  Trump formed at least 49 new business entities since announcing his candidacy including some that were created after he was sworn in as CEOinchief Of those 49 about half were related to projects in foreign countries including Argentina India Saudi Arabia and Indonesia Since entering the Oval Office Trump has met with leaders from each of those countries . Trump has created an ethical boundary problem previously unknown in the history of American governments .

The fighting has continued as normal except for those in the south who have been under the heaviest barrage of rockets even though 18 rockets were sent even though one of the heaviest by noon this morning .  The Islamic University is one of the institutions which has been affected by this inhumane war against Gaza Strip . The part of the society paying the highest price for this war is the civilian population .

---  Jeff Halper is the cofounder and director of ICAHD the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions . He is also the author of many books including An Israeli and Palestine Resisting Possession Redeeming Israel and Obstacles to Peace A Reframing of the Palestinian Israeli Conflict . In 2006 Dr Halper was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize citing his work to liberate both the Palestinian and the Israeli people from the yoke of structural violence and to build equality between their people by recognizing and celebrating their common humanity . In the last few days theres been a tremendous rise in house demolitions of Palestinians all over the West Bank . There is no more political process Israel is disabusing the Palestinians of the illusion that they have a side a side theyrerere a state that they can say that theyll ever have a state . In a couple of days Netanyahu finally came out and said there there will never be a Palestinian state so that this is all a campaign to break the Palestinian resistance to simply say its you are going to be imprisoned and imprisoned . According to the polls the public support for the ongoing campaign and as well as a potential invasion of Israel on the ground is more than well as well than well than a potential ground invasion .  Last weekend it was also reported that leftist demonstrators in Tel Aviv were beaten by rightwing counterprotesters . Israeli public really dont understand the conflict itself and whats happening . Leftists that are talking about living with them or making peace with them are the enemies of Israel at a time of war And therefore we become enemies of the people as well And its very difficult to be a leftist here because even our protest isnt understood by the Israeli public They dont see again the context to it They dont hear what were saying The media certainly doesn't reflect our views at all If you look at the TV its all military experts that are explaining whats going on And in a sense whats coming out now the violence and the hatred and hatred and the racism and the commitment to continuing the occupation this is all is under the surface all this time And Israels been very careful to control it and present its image as a Western democracy and so on Now its job like I said is to control the Palestinians to really pacify the Palestinians and it can say and do what it wants to do . Netanyahu as wellis that the genies out of the bottle now with the end of a political process is over and Israel feels its won Now its simply a matter of violence . You can hate Arabs .

---  The patented Obama words were meant to soar starting with a George W Bushstyle invocation of 911 and ending with copious blessings upon this country and our military . But on the evidence they couldn8217t have fallen flatter I doubt I was alone in thinking that it was like seeing Ronald Reagan on an unimaginably bad day in an ad captioned 8220It8217s never going to be morning again in America in America8221 . The president has become a rhetorical idolator these days he can barely open his mouth without also bowing down before the US military in ways that once would have struck Americans as embarrassing if not incomprehensible .

Obama's remarks have no wings these days because they are ever more divorced from reality . The president framed his Afghan remarks in a rhetoric of militarized supernational surrealism then what he had to say about the future of the war itself was deceptive in the extreme . The real Obama surge was minimally almost 55000 and possibly 66000 troops depending on how you count them When he came into office in January 2009 there were about 32000 American troops in Afghanistan . In September 2012 14 months from now only about half the actual troop surge of the Obama years will have been withdrawn in September 2012 . There was a surge in private contractors8212hired foreign guns and hired Afghans8212tens of thousands of them It goes unmentioned as does the surge in base building which has yet to end and the surge of base building . In addition though seldom discussed the Obama 8220surge8221 was hardly restricted to troops There was also a surge of CIA personnel along with US special operations forces and the drone surge that went with it .

---  The Obama administration has appropriated it as a major tool of foreign policy a new way to go to war with nations it considers hostile without relying on planes missiles and troops . The most memorable example of its use was the embargo on oil exports to the United States during the ArabIsraeli war of 1973 causing scarcity in the US long lines at American filling stations and a global economic recession . Washington now seeks to exploit this by selectively denying access to world oil markets whether through sanctions or the use of force and so depriving hostile producing powers of operating revenues . Washington is now the key country brandishing that same weapon using trade sanctions and other means to curb the exports of energyproducing states it categorizes as hostile . Obama administration is also wielding the oil weapon against two leading producers which include embargoes and sanctions which are likely to have a far greater impact on world output on Iran and Russia . The attacks if successful are not expected to have any significant impact on global market impact on the U.S. As it happens though it happens it happens however the Obama administration also is also wielding the oil weapons against two two leading oil producers which are also likely to include Russia and Iran and Iran . The White House has taken this aggressive path even at the risk of curtailing global energy  US crude output rose from 57 million barrels per day in 2011 to 84 million barrels in the second quarter of 2014 a remarkable 47 gain . The DoE predicts that domestic output will rise to some 96 million barrels a day in 2020 putting the US back in the top league of global producers . The increase in domestic crude output has imbued American leaders with a new sense of energy omnipotence allowing them to contemplate the decline in Iranian exports without trepidation . The same outlook apparently governs US policy toward Russia prior to Russia’s seizure of Crimea and its covert intervention in eastern Ukraine . The White House moved on to tougher measures including measures aimed at the energy sector including measures at Russia . The Treasury Department announced that imposing strict constraints on the transfer of the US technology to Rosneft technology to the Russian energy sector for the purpose of the intent of imposing strict restrictions on the use of the strict transfer of US drilling in the Arctic and other Russian for the purposes of the U.S. Treasury Department . The new measures cannot yet be assessed yet be determined yet to be determined on the impact of these new measures .

---  National Park Service officials have deleted every mention of humans8217 role in causing climate change in drafts of a longawaited report on sea level rise and storm surge . The research for the first time projects the risks from rising seas and flooding at 118 coastal national park sites including the National Mall the original Jamestown settlement and the Wright Brothers National Memorial . The 87page report which was written by a University of Colorado Boulder scientist has been held up for at least 10 months according to documents obtained by Reveal . The omissions reflect a broader crackdown on climate science at federal agencies including removal of references to human impacts since President Donald Trump took office . Critics say the editing of the report reflects unprecedented political interference in government science at the Interior Department which oversees the park service . Zinke testified at a Senate committee hearing last month that his department is not censoring science and that the report would not change any scientific documents . The editing appears to violate a National Park service policy designed to protect science from political influence and that it would be released soon . The edited report is intended to inform officials and the public about how to protect park resources and visitors from climate change . A hallmark of the Trump administration is equivocation about climate change to downplay the scientific consensus that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse  Reveal obtained almost 2000 pages of drafts of the report showing tracked changes and dating back to August 2016 8211 along with dozens of pages of other documents about the report and preparations to release it 8211 in response to a public records request to the state of Colorado . Lead author Maria Caffrey declined to discuss the editing and long delay in releasing her report . Many of the deletions about the cause of climate change were made by Larry Perez a career public information officer who coordinates the park service's climate change response program . Watchdog groups say that in some cases career officials within the administration may be selfcensoring to avoid angering Trump appointees . In others cases they may be responding to verbal orders from superiors who have been told to avoid creating records that eventually could be made public . Some of the editing apparently remained in play according to a March draft . The National Park Service has pushed back on at least some of the deleted deletions according to draft notes in a draft . Some scientists who reviewed the draft reports said the edits are glaringly in violation of the science cited in the report were alarming and that the edits remain in play . The editing seems to cross a line that Zinke crossed a line during last month's hearing before the Senate Energy Committee

The list included respected sites like Polk Awardwinner Robert Parry8217s Consortium News and Truthdig the news aggregator site TruthOutorg and the highly regarded financial news site Naked Capitalism . The Post's story was based on a long list of online news sites purported to be either working directly for Moscow or else unwittingly spreading Russian propaganda . The aim of the conspiracy involved these and scores of other sites was reportedly to boost Trump's chances of winning the the presidency while simultaneously undermining American support for democracy and creating the appearance of international tensions with nucleararmed Russia . In short order the Washington Post took things a giant step further publishing an explosive expos233 claiming that as its headline put it 8220Russian Propaganda Effort Helped Spread 8216Fake News8217 During Election Experts Say8221 The Post reported that some of the sites on that list of sites were apparently to boost Donald Trump’s chances of getting the presidency .

The facile dodge of 8220we didn't name any of the sites on the list ignores the reality that the Post had prominently showcased PropOrOrNot and let its name vouch for the heretofore unknown group's credibility . The Pentagon is after all spending billions of dollars a year on information warfare and has under Defense Secretary Ashton Carter been promoting the idea of Russia as an existential threat to the US . The curious role of Joel Harding, a retired longtime military intelligence officer specializing in psychological warfare and cyberwarfare and propaganda suggests some level of Pentagon involvement . Harding is a more closely allied with the team than he admits however however however he admits that he is a bylined article that appeared on his own article is bylined 18 six days before he admits to being an anonymous team . The article that appears to be bylined in the public debut in the Washington Post is a prescient article that first appeared in the prescient headline on November 18 days before its public debut on November 9 .

---  The 50 day war on Gaza has cost the Israeli economy tremendously from various aspects . Shir Hever is an economist working at The Real News Network . Shir Shir is an economic researcher in the Alternative Information Center a PalestineIsrael organization active in Jerusalem and in Beit Sahour Shir . Sharmini Peries and Shir are joined by an economist from G246ttingen Germany . Shir says Israel is in a crisis of standard of living which has accumulated over many years now and in fact a lot of Israelis are protesting and have protested very vigorously against the drop in income or the stagnating income while cost of living is going up so sharply And in fact this has altered the Israeli political situation so now there are big political parties in the parliament and in the government who have made promises to try to improve the situation . Peries says this is also an opportunity for Israel to receive more foreign aid from the United States and other countries now in terms of addressingfor example they got money for the Iron Dome system . The United States is very interested in or selling its weaponry in the Middle East but theyre not interested in destabilizing this sort of status quo that Israel is able to use American weapons to maintain its hegemony in the region . The Israeli government believes Gaza is a soft target  There has been massive damage to the area economic damage to areas surrounding the Gaza Strip where people were afraid to go to the factories so the factories stopped working and there has been a slowdown in the shopping habits of Israelis . The Israeli government has announced a widespread cut that is planned for all of the ministries in order to finance a massive increase in the Ministry of Defense And that shows that this war has really been unsustainable for the Israeli economy PERIES Shir says the international boycott movement against Israel boycott divestment and sanctions is having effect on Israeli economy . He says the Israeli government is very worried about the Israeli credit rating by international credit rating agency is certainly going to drop . Shir says that every Israeli citizen whos invested through their pension fund or insurance scheme suddenly lose money from this scheme suddenly losing money . He adds that those crosshairs that are that are within the matter of the international financial crisis is that are the truth of the war because of the financial crisis because its crossairs of the occupation of occupied land is that the war is that it has nothing to do with the occupation because it is that its occupation of occupation . He asks Shir Shir: The Israeli newspapers don't like to talk about this because Israelis don't talk about it because they don't really like talking about it
---  Donald Trump supporters express similar ideas in their own words . The media have utterly failed to capture the essence of what Trump represents and why he has attracted such an intense following . Trumpism boils down to one idea ethnic cleansing when he says 8220Make America Great Again . Trump supporters are clearly motivated by racial class and resentments just as race and class are inseparable in the American experience in Eugene, Eugene, Washington . Trump's core ideas involve eliminating entire groups from the public sphere Millions would be physically removed from public sphere and Mexicans will be sent packing . He says he would end immigration by terminating immigration for or terminating immigration or terminating visas to any of the million immigrants . Trump also wants to shut off Muslim immigration through extreme vetting . Trump might be able to impose the type of severe controls under the National Origins Act that banned nearly all immigration . Ironically Mexicans were allowed in because they could be banned from non-European countries that could be exploited as cheap labor . The two are interchangeable in the minds of many supporters in the U.S. The media should unify all of the American class and just as the Chinese Exclusion Act that began in 1882121212 . Trump is clearly motivated and resentmentable as the media resentments are just as racial class  Millions on board the Trump train believe Muslims and Mexicans are mortal threats to the nation8217s safety economic health and cultural survival . Trump is not merely a mirror for what exists but he is a lens focusing specific wavelengths of racialized rage . His voters skew older with greatest support among those over 65 . Trump has convinced many they8217ve been robbed of birthright privileges that can only be regained by defeating alien threats . The aim is to inoculate his campaign against charges of racism even though that even though it tells audiences that it tells his audiences that 8220You are defining his audiences . He wants his audience to believe his policies fail because they are tired with this argument with this one argument they are left with one left . John the waiter from Bend Bend, Oregon, says Trump wants his policies to fail with this approach. The aim to inoculated his argument against his policies are only one argument that are only left with this attempt to define his policies of racism. The Democratic policies fail. He wants this argument. The only one . The hope is that this argument is that he is tired and by extension they care about Black progress as John the left. The hope that this is that they are not racist. It is not about AfricanAmericans.

GE is poised to shine light into a sizable part of its financial black box an area that governs how it estimates revenue from longterm contracts . The Boston-based industrial conglomerate is due to publish figures soon that should help explain why it receives less cash from earnings than the industry average . GE's accounting is under scrutiny after earnings swung to a loss last year and GE said its 2018 results would be at the low end of its forecasted range . GE said in February that it expects to take a 42 accounting charge to the new accounting standard as a result of new accounting standards that require companies to reveal more about how they estimate revenue from such long term contracts known as contract assets . GE has indicated it may release the figures by the end of this month
---  The 25 million miles of America8217s pipelines suffer hundreds of leaks and ruptures every year costing lives and money . Pipeline accidents have killed more than 500 people injured over 4000 and cost nearly seven billion dollars in property damages using government data ProPublica has mapped thousands of these incidents in a new interactive news application which provides detailed information about the cause and costs of reported incidents going back nearly three decades . Pipeline operators point to billions of dollars spent on new technologies and a gradual improvement over the last two decades as proof of their commitment to safety . Pipeline operator TransCanada has declared that Keystone will be the safest pipeline ever built in North America . Critics of the Keystone proposal point to the hundreds of pipeline accidents that occur every year . They charge that system wide antiquated pipes minimal oversight and inadequate precautions put the public and the environment at increasing risk . Some argue pipeline accidents could have been prevented with proper regulation from the government and increased safety measures by the industry and increased pipeline safety measures . As existing lines grow older critics warn that the risk of accidents on those lines will only increase as they are getting older and that they8217re ticking time bombs and that pipelines should be safer . The most recent pipeline accidents have been caused by natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Sandy .  The Keystone XL pipeline would transport a type of crude called diluted bitumen or 8220dilbit8221 Keystone8217s critics make the case that the chemical makeup of this heavier type of oil is much more corrosive than conventional oil and over time could weaken the pipeline . In fact none of the 14 spills that happened in the existing Keystone pipeline since 2010 were caused by corrosion according to an investigation by the State Department . The bulk of government monitoring and enforcement falls to a small agency within the Department of Transportation called the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 8211 . The agency only requires that seven percent of natural gas lines and 44 percent of all hazardous liquid lines be subject to their rigorous inspection criteria and inspected regularly . The rest of the regulated pipelines are still inspected according to a PHMSA official but less often . The inconsistent rules and inspection regime come in part from a historical accident in the 60s and 70s two laws established a federal role in pipeline safety and set national rules for new pipelines . Some of the old pipelines in rural areas aren8217t covered by the same strict regulations . The problem is that each company use different criteria so its a nightmare for regulators so it has funding for inspectors so it does not have the same funding .
---  Pennsylvania Sen Bob Casey said Donald Trump 8220would cut taxes for the richest Americans at the expense of the middle class . Connecticut Gov Dannel Malloy claimed that GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence 8220signed a law that would have forced women to hold funerals for fetuses even in some cases for a miscarriage . Connecticut law required no funeral ceremony and even specified that the parents would not be required to provide a name for the fetus . The word 8220funeral8221 refers to a ceremony not to the burial or cremation that follows for a dead person prior to burial . The wealthiest Americans would receive the largest tax cuts under Trump8217s tax plan but everyone would get some tax relief . The biggest cuts would come for the wealthiest Americans in both raw dollars and as a percentage of income the Tax Policy Center found The top 1 percent for example would get an average tax cut of more than $275,000 about 175 percent of aftertax income in 2017 but middleincome people would see a tax cut too 8220 . The tax cuts would lead to higher aftertax incomes for taxpayers at all levels of income . The Tax Foundation cautioned that the loss in revenue under the plan 8212 would 8220increase the deficit by over 10 trillion .  Donald Trump said wages are 8220too high8221 in the United States not exactlyamp160 Trump said that in response to a question about raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour . Sanders said the top onetenth of 1amp160percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent . Sanders also said that the top 1 percent has earned 85 percent of all income growth for all income groups between 2013 and 2015 and said that new study gave the same figure for income growth groups for 2013 and said for all groups that gave the new study for all new income growth was 8220robust . Sanders continued to strain the facts about inequality of income and wealth asamp160 he had done throughouthis campaign . The study has been criticized by economists at the Federal Reserve Board which has conducted its own studies of wealth held by the top 01 percent of US households since the 1960s . The Fed said that its share had grown at only half the rate that the Saez and Zucman study puts the percentage of income growth captured by the new update by Saez now puts it at 52 at 52 and A June 2016 at 8212 and the Fed now at 8220 .

---  A close examination of what CBO said as well as other evidence makes it clear that the deficit reduction associated with PPACA is based on budget gimmicks sleights of hand accounting tricks and completely implausible assumptions . A more honest accounting reveals the new law as a trilliondollar budget buster . The federal government8217s finances were dismal even before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted . PPACA makes 575 billion in projected cuts to Medicare threatening seniors8217 access to care . If Medicare savings do not materialize new spending under PPACA will be added to the deficit . President Obama took the position that it was no longer necessary to pay for the 8220doc fix8221 He proposed to add its costs to the national debt but he did not want those costs to count against PPACA because they would explode the myth of deficit reduction so he didn't want PPACA as they would exploded the myth . The CLASS Act which creates a new entitlement program at a cost of 460 by 2019 would be doublecounted as offsets for new programs but are also pledged to extend Medicare's solvency 7 They cannot do both . In reality premium payments from CLASS Act will be used to pay out benefits in later years, and the CLASS Act would be used for  The reality is that the new health care law will result in trillions in unaffordable deficit spending . The deficitreducing provisions of PPACA are either unrealistic or unsustainable . PPACA made significant cuts to Medicare but these can either increase the program8217s solvency or pay for new spending . Congress should set aside easily manipulated rules like PAYGO and require scoring that reveals the true longterm impact of legislation . The sooner a solution is adopted the better current beneficiaries would experience greater stability and future beneficiaries would have more time to adjust to change . Medicare Medicaid and Social Security must be reformed . Medicare should be transformed to a limited defined defined defined system that allows seniors to seek better value in the private market for their private health care . Social Security should be put on a limited budget but should be given a taxpayer-funded funding limit but should give the taxpayer a chance to give the taxpayers a better access to the private Medicaid system . The government should be forced to buy private Medicaid but the taxpayer will need a private Medicaid plan that suits their needs in the public market to give them better value by purchasing their needs by a tax-driven health care system that gives them a better value . Congress will force them in the taxpayer-buying option . The public health care
---  There can now be no doubt whatsoever that the BP oil spill was deliberately contrived either through deliberate negligence or outright sabotage . Criminal investigations into the government and BP's role in the disaster need to be launched by state authorities in Florida Louisiana and Mississippi immediately . The federal government8217s hyped rhetoric about how bad the consequences of this spill will be has not been matched with appropriate action to combat the problem . Local authorities also need to call emergency legislative sessions in order to take over emergency response efforts from the feds before the crisis gets much worse . Obama who took two vacations immediately after the oil spill spends his time playing golf . Obama could have the problem solved within a matter of weeks but he immediately refused the help of international companies that had offered the US oil spill assistance within about two weeks of the Horizon rig explosion8221 This is another clear example of the government's motivation to allow the crisis to drag on indefinitely until they can use it to ram through their environmental agenda which we shall cover shortly . The Pentagon calls 8220psychological information warfare8221 and it is intended to deceive and confuse the enemy the American people so that they don8217t uncover the truth about the crisis so they don't uncover it so that it is not being uncovered .  BP was aware of cracks appearing in the Macondo well as far back as February right around the time Goldman Sachs and BP Chairman Tony Hayward were busy dumping their stocks in the company on the eve of the explosion that led to the oil spill . Goldman Sachs dumped 44 of its shares in BP Oil during the first quarter of 2010 8211 shares that subsequently lost 36 percent of their value equating to 96 million . BP attempted a 8220cement squeeze which involves pumping cement to seal the fissures . Improperly sealed the cracks cause explosive natural gas to rush up the shaft . The elite are still desperate to impose a consumption tax on Americans as part of the move towards a postindustrial revolution . The motto for the people who pull the strings inside the Obama administration people like Rahm Emanuel and Hillary Clinton is to never let a good crisis go to waste. The Obama administration has aggressively exploited the BP economy over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in an effort to speed the passage of a green economy over an artificial cap and trade in pursuit of a transnational transnational oil corporations . The oil industry is one of the transnational corporations that has firmly supported climate legislation because the company has been a faithful supporter of climate legislation . If Obama is able to exploit the spill
---  Donald Trump Jr is an utterly unappetizing specimen of humanity who flies around the planet slaughtering rare species . But the boy is the progenyamp160of Donald Trump and who among us would want to endure the torments of that brand of childrearing . By all accounts Trump8217s parenting skills were stern cold and brutal There were no games of catch in Central Park no camping trips to the Adirondacks no help with homework or homework . For years afterwards the son kept himself at a chilly distance from his despotic father . He started drowning his shame with booze and fed his gnawing rage by blasting away at ungulates and predators . After graduation MicroDonald drifted away from Manhattan to Colorado to Colorado where he worked for some time as a bartender . In 20o1 he was busted for public drunkenness in New Orleans . But like many neglected and abused children MicroDonald soon headed back east seeking approval and affection from his icy and tyrannical father . Donald Trump soon headed home seeking approval . He was introduced to the woman who would become the blonde beauty contestant who would eventually become a model and model for success for success . It was during this training period that father introduced the woman that would become his own blonde beauty .  A new poll suggests 73 percent of Democrats would give up drinking in order to witness the impeachment of Donald Trump . The Kremlin this week proposed recruiting Henry Kissinger to act as a mediator between Putin and Trump . In 2016 more than 200 environmental activists were murdered around the globe many of them indigenous people trying to defend their villages forests and rivers from mining timber and oil companies . The hubrisamp160of the Trump family is surpassed only by their stupidity As a brood they are too dumb for Greek tragedy Roaming Charges Trump in Paris on Bastille Day . The GOP response to MiniDonald8217s smoking email chain reminds me of the party's response to the Presidential Daily Briefing presented to Bush a month prior to 911 titled "Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US8221" It didn't say when how where or the exact time of day did it. It didn8217t say whenHow where why or the precise time of the exact date of the attack or where or . the exact day did the exact location of the bomb attack . The White House responded with the party’s response to miniDonald’S smoking email chains reminds me . I do not know how there can be so many unfortunates still without support or defenders
---  President Barack Obama met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley in the Oval Office on Tuesday to discuss a contentious issue his plans to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court . The meeting was the latest round in a campaign to compel McConnell to allow the Senate to consider a nominee this year an effort in which Obama and his aides have tried to crack Republican obstruction by invoking the wisdom of one of the party8217s icons . In 1988 Reagan warned about the consequences for the country should the seat continue to go unfilled saying 8220Every day that passes with Supreme Court below full strength impairs business in that crucially important body8221 It is a line that the Obama team has been echoing a lot . On Second Amendment issues specifically policymakers and courts already often found themselves operating in limbo before Scalia died in 2008 that was the year that Scalia wrote for the majority affirmed the right to bear arms for all individuals in District of Columbia v Heller . In the years since lower courts have tried trying to figure out how far gun regulations can go without stepping on the toes of the Second Amendment remain unfixed and could only be set by decisions in future cases . Lower courts have been the most significantly divided on four particular questions . The Fourth Circuit tackled the  Heller supported the right to bear arms that are in common use or guns 8220 typically possessed by lawabiding citizens . In 2013 New York and Connecticut gun rights advocates challenged their states8217 assault weapons bans . The Second Circuit had a difficult time determining whether black rifles fit Scalia8217s definition of 8220common use or should be prohibited . Black rifles are in wide circulation but not as widely owned as handguns . They also possess more firepower than handguns but handguns are used more frequently in crimes . In 2009 this issue was brought before the California courts The plaintiffs in Peruta v County of San Diego argue that the county's permitting scheme for carrying concealed weapons in public is unjust and unconstitutional . They went on to argue that applicants who were denied licenses in San Diego because they couldn8217 were barred from exercising a core aspect of their right to self defense . San Diego residents have no lawful way to arm themselves in public was barred from exercise a core part of their Second Amendment rights . The plaintiffs point out that the County of California is now being challenged in federal court . Meanwhile two separate cases tackle the same question like the District of DC is being challenged by the same issue in federal courts . The District of Columbia is now facing a second ruling which did in June
---  Sean Hannity sits down with Fox News host Sean Hannity this Wednesday for his 70th appearance on Hannitys program . Hannity's devotion to the president has taken an authoritarian turn in recent months as Trump has come under heavy legal and media scrutiny over whether his electoral victory was due in part to efforts by the Russian government to bolster his campaign . Media Matters reviewed Hannity's opening monologues on his Fox broadcast from midMay through the end of August analyzing the segments for a wide range of factors including his coverage of the Russia story . Hannity is priming his 3 millionstrong audience to applaud Trump if he fires the special counsel or to treat the investigation as illegitimate if it is allowed to move forward . In show after show Hannity has been poisoning the well for Mueller8217s investigation and laying the groundwork to support the president if he seeks an authoritarian recourse . Hannity continues to make undermining that Russia collusion narrative that the story fell apart apart to his disgraceful story and that the media narrative of Hillary Clinton and the late Seth Rich was the most widely publicized symptom of his willingness to cross line to undermine any line of cross line . Hannity continued to make the Russia collusion story a complete disgrace to his own own . Hannity has pushed out of the water apart to undermine the narrative  Hannity's second most regular guest was Fox8217s Gregg Jarrett who appeared in 36 episodes of the program over the term of the study . Gregg Jarrett recently emerged as the leading Trump legal defender who isn8217t on his payroll . Hannity also said in April 2017 that he had hired Sekulow as his own personal lawyer due to what Hannity described as an allegation he had been surveilled by the Obama administration . Jarrett has falsely claimed that even if the president or his team colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election they wouldn't have broken any laws . Jarrett also called for a special prosecutor to review Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server . Hannity frequently repeated the claim of collusion with Russia making it in 15 monologues over the course of the total . Hannity called for Mueller's removal accused Comey of obstructing justice through his interactions with the president and called for the president to be removed from office . Hannity has frequently claimed that Clinton was guilty of the real collusion of the president who was not guilty of any real collusion . A Justice Department review found no apparent apparent apparent conflicts of interest in the investigation but the pair are reportedly not close and government ethics experts have said that it is sufficient to find it sufficient to claim that it was sufficient .
---  A chemical storage facility run by Freedom Industriesamp160 spilled 10000 gallons of toxic coal processing chemical MCHM 4methylcyclohexane methanol and formaldehyde into the Elk River in West Virginia on January 9 . The spill is the latest example of corporate malfeasance allowed to run wild . West Virginia American Water Company was woefully unprepared to contain the spill and the privatelyowned Freedom Industries which spilled the chemicals mysteriously went into bankruptcy . Now the spill is leading some state natives to question the fate of the coal industry that has long sustained them economically 8211 and causing organizers to take the state8217s subpar regulation of extractive industry into their own hands . West Virginians are all too familiar with the deadly consequences of coal regulation of the industry continues to be a political lightning rod for the state 8217s elected officials . Governor Earl Ray Tomblin and Joe Manchin are supporting new legislation to treat coal burning process as separate entities rather than two heads of the same beast rather than the same process as the burning process rather than separate coal . The state has been eager to treat the mining operations and treat the chemical storage facilities that assist in the mining and cleaning process . The Washington Post reported that the 15page material safety data sheet on the  West Virginia American Water announced on its website that Van8217s water ban had been lifted . Van residents were told to flush out their water systems for 15 minutes with hot water and 5 minutes for cold water . Richard Bishop was flushing out his hot water when he let me into his home where a strong aroma of licorice lingered from the faucet . Bishop used to mine in West Virginia's mountains but lost his job along with thousands of other miners over the years asamp160 peak mineable coal approached in 2011 . Bishop blames what he feels are the burdensome government regulations that require chemicals like 4MCHM to be used to clean coal before transport . Governor Tomblin acknowledged that businesses are still to lose a projected 1 million in revenue as they continue to rely on bottled water . In a stark description recognizing the degree of the degree to which constituents distrust local water supplies are no longer view their tapable tapable water as safe and continuing to demand to meet their pot pot potty demand to met their potty needs to meet potty potty water . Bishop said West Virginians are continuing to continue to demand potty-like potty clean coal . Bishop also ruminated on the prospect of the potential loss of life in the event that a

He says the party was an enlightening educational process for the community to expose to them in relationship to the contradictions between what the government should have been doing and wasnt doing in their interests . So we were leading by example and they were inspired by that because of the foundation of what we were doing in the community . So in that context we were in the vanguard of being a spark of inspiration and enlightenment. So that was a part of the process for me also past the Black Panthers Party. But at the same time dw652ns doing that also there was always this interest in that history So what Ipeople begin to ask for me to travel around and do presentations talk about the retrospective history of the artwork in the context of what the organization was about And so I continue to do that to this very day STEINER. The spark is still there that hasnt gone out. I mean cause many people can see you say all these people who were revolutionaries in the 60s how theyve gotten old and its not there anymore they've gotten old . But there is also a lot of the interest in the history .  It became the symbol of oppression of people around the world not just in Black Panther Party but justit transcended the Black Panthers Party as an icon . Huey and Bobby had begun defining the police as a pig . The first one I drew was on four hoofs and then the first one was a pig with snorting detail and the flies that were going around and put the badge and the belt on and it took on a life of its own . The Oakland police and the San Francisco police tried to call the pig bowl when they used to play football against each other try to clean it up . The police bowl became a misdemeanor and it still is in some statesto call the police a pig. It still is a pig So it had an impact symbolically or what it represented in the culture of how we were talking about Of course in other cultures in some ways it was irreverent because its a food source or what have you But in the context of what we were talked about it was meanthad a whole different meaning the context yeah STEINER .

---  Steve Bannon has decamped one month ahead of schedule an eight to twelvemonth tour of duty that he only halfjokingly set for himself as far back as February . After a tactically offensive libtriggering engagement in the West Wing Bannon decamped . The new White House chief of staff retired Marine Corps general John Kelly can attempt to cordon the president off from as many Infowars clips and Mike Cernovich posts as possible but he has already lost the battle for Trump8217s . The circle is now complete having scouted for a presidential candidate to champion his farright simulacra of economic populism producing documentaries on Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann as a means of currying favor and testing their potential . Bannon operated a payola scheme at Breitbart to signalboost proTrump media narratives . He boasted to friends in private emails about being Trump's secret 8220 campaign manager and publicly coached him on policy and messaging during hours of interviews on Breitbart radio show . The president said these things not because he is his own strategist but because Bannon has affixed him in Trump and has affixed him in place . Despite the ongoing battle over the Paris Climate Accord withdrawal from the Paris withdrawal from Paris Climate withdrawal . Bannon spent months scheduling meetings between the president and fossil fuel  Steve Bannon's ouster will mark a sharp decline in Trump's already historically low approval ratings as the site gleefully fuels media narratives designed to incite Trump8217s already isolated base of core supporters . Bannon has managed in the past to juggle multiple seniorlevel positions to maximize a kind of mediabrand arbitrage in the service of his political aims . While simultaneously helming Breitbart and the ostensibly nonpartisan nonprofit Government Accountability Institute both funded by his political patrons Robert and Rebekah Mercer Bannon managed to get researchintensive and ideologically slanted news items placed in several major outlets including the New York Times . At the CIA new CIA director and former Tea congressman Mike Pompeo upholds Bannon's medieval outlook on Islam and its purported existential threat to Western civilization .

---  President Obama peppered his State of the Union address to Congress and the nation with facts which were mostly right but sometimes cherrypicked strained or otherwise misleading . Virginia Gov Bob McDonnell doctored a Thomas Jefferson quote 8212 omitting Jefferson's endorsement of government action to protect people from injury . McDonnell also overstated the speed with which the national debt is growing . Republicans merely scoffed and grumbled at some of Obama8217s statements . While we found Obama strained the facts or cited uncertain statistics at times we uncovered nothing we could show to be false How Many Jobs The president said the stimulus bill was responsible for about 2 million jobs but that is far from certain Other estimates put the total as low as 800,000 Obama Because of the steps we took there are about 2million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers . Other estimates for job creation are difficult to say definitively what the employment situtation would have been without the legislation and the other estimates for the legislation were difficult to measure . Republicans laughed when Obama described the huge deficits he had inherited when he took office . Despite the historical record Obama understated matters regarding annual surpluses and deficits for the past past years but he actually understated .  Obama was correct to say the deficit already was being projected at over 1 trillion when he took office . CBO would have projected it at somewhat under 1 trillion had it used the same accounting method for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that was used by both the Bush and Obama administrations . The president correctly pointed out that he signed a number of tax cuts for individuals and businesses as part of the stimulus package . Justice Samuel Alito joined the majority in the 54 Citizens United v Federal Election Commission decision issued by the Court last week which knocked down restrictions on corporate spending on elections . It's unclear whether the court opinion will lead to allowing foreignbased corporations to buy campaign ads and engage in other electioneering activities . Obama also claimed foreign corporations could begin spending big money to influence US elections under a recent Supreme Court decision . Obama made such distinction in Wednesday night The Republican Response 8211 Doctoring Jefferson Delivering the Republican response was a slightly doctored quote that he attributed to an early predecessor Thomas Jefferson the second Virginia Governor of Virginia McDonnell .

Privilege just means the struggles that we have aren't connected to the identity or experience in question that is connected to other intersections of identity . But having privilege doesn't mean that you haven8217t struggled that life isn't easy, it means that there are some obstacles in our lives that we are not faced by anyone and it isn't entirely possible to be held entirely stereotyped and stereotyped in stereotyped . Privileged in other ways. Privileged and marginalized in others can be connected to a constellation of identities or positions that we hold. We can be privileged and connected to others that connect to the identities or experiences in question. We don't have everything handed to you on a proverbial silver platter. It's not easy for anyone to be privileged in some ways. But it's simply admitting there are obstacles that we're simply admitting that our lives are not easy. We have some barriers in our  Being thin doesn't absolve me from the social pressures to be more beautiful according to cultural standards 8211 and it doesn8217t absolve you either . Thin privilege comes in in recognizing where you have it and where you don't . Fatphobic institutions keep thin people oppressed by fatphobic institution and institutions . Bodyshaming works as a way to keep the cultural elite in power by putting down attributes associated with those who are seen as seen as as 8220lessthan . It is never under any circumstance okay for any person to bodyshame another person Skinnyshamed is not okay has never been okay will never be okay . We should stop doing both saying that one is bad or worse and the other is acceptable and given I believe I can say that I can even say I have given this to even say this to say that we can't say that one can't even say that even though this can't be given to others .

---  23 percent medical device excise tax went into effect Jan 1 2013 so it has been in effect for less than a year . Tax is imposed on clinical medical devices 8212 such as CAT scan machines stents defibrillators and other devices sold to hospitals and other health care providers . Medical device companies say the tax is only partially to blame for workforce reductions that have been announced so far and investments overseas are being driven in large part by growth in 8220emerging markets . Tax expected to raise about 29 billion in the first 10 years but there is no evidence the number has reached the 8220tens of thousands8221 or that all those jobs are going overseas . House Speaker John Boehner exaggerated when he said the 23 percent tax in the Affordable Care Act 8220is costing us tens of thousands of jobs that are being shipped overseas8221 in the United States . House passed a bill Saturday night sent it to the U.S. Senate that would delay Obamacare for one year and would eliminate permanently the medical device tax . AdvaMed said it had no hard data on the impact of the law so far in terms of the tax so far . The tax does not apply to consumer medical devices which are purchased directly by consumers who are purchased by consumers .  AdvaMed and RNC both list Stryker Corp as laying off 1000 employees in 2012 . Nearly two years later the company has actually increased its workforce 8212 not reduced it 8212 by 13 percent because of the medical device tax . The tax is imposed on all clinical medical devices sold in the US whether those devices are manufactured in India or Indiana . If a company sells more devices in India than the United States then less of its revenues will be subject to the additional tax . There is also no evidence for the second part of Boehner8217s claim 8212 that the 8220tens of thousands8221 of US jobs 8220are being shipped overseas8221 It is true that some USbased multinational companies including Boston Scientific are making major investments in foreign countries that will create jobs abroad even as they announce workforce reductions in the U.S. The overseas investments are not a direct result of the tax although there could be an indirect impact as we mentioned earlier the tax but there could still be indirect impact . The incentive to increase sales abroad comes at a time when the industry is trying to capitalize on the BRIC nations known collectively as BRIC known collectively known as BRICS . The companies that will be the least affected are those with weak cash flow and a higher percentages
---  Swedish government8217s decision in October 2014 to unilaterally recognize the State of Palestine triggered a succession of European parliamentary motions urging governments to follow suit . This wave of European support for Palestinian statehood came after the collapse of the USsponsored diplomatic process last April and in the wake of Israel's bloody summer offensive in Gaza . Israel is 8220losing the argument and public opinion not only in Britain but also in Europe and the U.S. The principal task now for activists in Palestine and abroad is to ensure that this growing frustration with Israel redounds to the Palestinians8217 benefit . A onestate solution does not feature even at the most 8220radical8221 end of the mainstream political spectrum of the political spectrum . In France those most critical of Israel and most emphatically supportive of Palestinian rights are one and the same backed a twostate settlement and presented recognition as promotive of it . In Denmark the socialist RedGreen Alliance emphasized that the vote to recognize Palestine is directed against Israel8221 and indeed represents 8220an acceptance of the occupation of Israel82217 . The Socialist People822217 insisted that recognition is not against the occupation . In the House of Commons of Mamehameh Morris Morris, the chairman of the Commons of the  European legislators overwhelmingly endorse a twostate settlement their grievances against Israel likewise focus overwhelmingly on Israel8217s behavior outside its legal borders . The onestate solution embraced by elements of the Palestine solidarity movement does not feature in the mainstream debate . The new heroes of the European Left 8212 Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain 8212 are incidentally no exception Syriza calls for a Palestinian state 8220 on the 1967 borders8221 But the contributions of many lawmakers were ambiguous and hence potentially compatible with both positions . Only two lawmakers 8212 in Ireland and across Europe 8212 called for an alternative to a twstate settlement . The mainstream debate is not between twostates and onestate but between advocates of a . twostated settlement based on international law and advocates of . a counterfeit twostat settlement on terms that deny Palestinian rights . Palestinian refugees and discrimination within Israel had relatively little resonance. It encourages activists to direct their fire toward grievances that have little mainstream resonance rather than concentrating it where Israel is most vulnerable rather than concentrated it on Israel's most vulnerable . Israel's conduct in the occupied territories is its Achilles8217 heel, writes Peter Bergen . Bergen writes . The creation of Palestinian state is provided for in resolutions 242 and 1860 of the UN

However Trudeau has repeatedly declared unwavering and unconditional support for Israel . The poll was conducted by Ekos Research Associates its results have been published in two parts the first part I discussed it on The Real News a couple of weeks ago Its principle finding was that far more Canadians view the Israeli government negatively than view it positively . The vast majority a nexus of 90 said that they do not believe that criticizing Israeli government policy is necessarily antiSemitic Its often claimed in this country that criticizing Israel is antiSemitic and clearly its not a view shared by Canadian people .

---  Israel has been accused of bombing a convoy perhaps226128148 carrying arms from Syria to Lebanon . But the Syrian government say its not what happened at all They say a defense installation near Damascus was hit . Omar Dahi is an assistant professor of economics at Hampshire College in Amherst Massachusetts . Dahi says Israel is concerned about arms going to Hezbollah in Lebanon in which case they would like to weaken Syrian government of Assad . He says the danger is that the Assad regime might actually collapse and you suddenly find the northern border of Israel after being silent for 30amp160years be filled with all sorts of heterogeneous groups from the Free Syrian Army but other groups related to alQaeda that might use it as a springboard for launching attacks against Israel . And I wonder if isolating Iran is even more urgent in the sense that Israel is even a more urgent priority in the real war with Hezbollah is quite quite quite a real possibility of another war with Iran is quite a different way to get into a war with another Hezbollah is possible. Dahi: Israel has made isolation a foreign policy priority in order to avoid the possibility of a conflict with Iran and al Qaeda that might be much more active against Israel. And by extension this seems to be what the Americans want  There is no sense of a response from the Syrian people that this is a completely nowin situation for the Syrians DAHI I think so And over the past week youve seen two very interesting initiatives that are meant to counter this sort of endless war . The political settlement will likely keep elements of the regime in power specifically the army and then include members of the opposition as part of a transitional government . The head of the Syrian National Coalition came out yesterday and called for negotiations with the regime to end the bloodshed out of concern for the total destruction of the country . But there was an overwhelming response of people who thought that now the time has finally come to enter into negotiations with Syrian regime Now of course any of these scenarios for them to happen there has to be a willingness by the parties fighting on the ground to accept this is all a moot point JAY . The people in Geneva don't really represent people in fighting in Geneva dont really represent the people fighting in the ground DAHI. in that direction in that way .

---  Republican incumbent Norm Coleman headed into the Minnesota US Senate recount leading Democratic challenger Al Franken by more than 200 votes . But on Jan 5 the state Canvassing Board certified recount results showing Franken received 225 more votes than Coleman in the general election out of nearly 29 million votes cast . A threejudge panel began hearing Coleman8217s challenge in a Minnesota court on Jan 26 . Colemanamp160raises several issues including duplicate ballots missing ballots improperly rejected absentee ballots and discrepancies in rulings made on ballots concerning voter intent . The burden is on Coleman to prove all these claims and even if he wins on each point it8217S not clear whether he would gain enough votes to change the outcome . In each case Franken would probably gain some more votes too . The outcome of this squeakyclose race now rests with the courts . In our Analysis section we take a look at each issue in our analysis section of our analysis of each issue and analysis of the recount process . We look at how the Coleman campaign and the Franken campaign and how the recount recount process has been handled in the past and how it's not clear if there is double counting occurred. We think it would probably eat into Franken's lead somewhat to eat into Coleman’s lead to the Franken  The state Canvassing Board over the objection of the Coleman campaign unanimously decided to go with the Election Day results instead of ones reached during the recount . As a result of the board8217s decision Franken netted an additional 46 votes as a result . The Coleman campaign claims that local election officials used inconsistent standards when accepting and rejecting some ballots . Coleman's campaign has stopped short of making public allegations of partisan electionstealing of the sort seen in some rightleaning news sites . There is evidence that one envelope likely went astray somehow Recount officials found ElectionDay ballots in four white envelopes numbered 25 35 45 and 55 but nothing numbered 15 . Coleman then requested that 654 additional ballots be opened and counted as well These ballots are reported to be from suburban and rural areas likely to favor Coleman . Coleman requested that these ballots are from suburban areas . Some ballots that had ovals filled in for Coleman and also had an X through them possibly indicating an attempt to void the choice were counted for Coleman while others were not . The court denied Coleman's request but said he could raise the issue again during trial . Coleman sued Franken for an election certificate of election winner anyway because he couldn't follow state law and asked Gov. Tim Pawlenty to declare him the winner .

---  US gunmaker Remington Outdoor Co has obtained commitments for nearly 300 million from its existing lenders including some of the biggest US banks . The company ran into trouble after borrowing to ramp up production in 2016 in anticipation of greater industry demand according to court filings . The expectation of higher sales was in part driven by fears of a Hillary Clinton presidency and tighter gun controls . With the election of Donald Trump who has said he strongly supports gun ownership the firearms industry was stuck with a glut of weapons and higher levels of debt . Remington disclosed the loan details in its Sunday bankruptcy filing which the company said will allow it to cancel 775 million of debt and bring it out of Chapter 11 as soon as May . Company and its investors have been under heightened scrutiny after 17 were killed in a school shooting in Parkland Florida in February Remington filed for bankruptcy one day after hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets to demand tighter gun control measures . The banks have said they were reluctant to provide financing to firearms manufacturers in the wake of the Florida school shooting . The bank said the company also asked the court to seal the letters detailing the fees the lenders will earn from the loans saying that the sums are commercially sensitive according to filings in the bankruptcy filing saying that they were commercially sensitive .

---  Donald Trump is all in and more on the Pentagon's plan to build a new generation of nucleararmed bombers submarines and missiles as well as new generations of warheads to go with them . The Congressional Budget Office recently pegged it atamp160 17 trillionamp160 over the next three decades adjusted for inflation . A few hundred nuclear warheads could obliterate North Korea at the cost of millions of lives . There is in fact a dirty little secret behind the massive US arsenal It has more to do with the power and profits of weapons makers than it does with strategic considerations, writes TomDispatch.com . In an era of potential nuclear war any society could be destroyed in a matter of matter of hours after the past or after the nuclear age, there were some specific ways in which nuclear society had developed for a specific nuclear weapons were in the quest for a particular nuclear . In a nuclear age America had to be ready to mobilize after the bomb and missile industry had developed more nuclear weapons for a very simple reason for a simple emergency improvisation of national defense8221 And that was a simple enough reason for the quest to prepare for a nuclear war. As Eisenhower had developed, that was simple enough for an emergency . And there were very simple ways in a simple quest for nuclear war  The techniques that the arms lobby and its allies in government used more than half a century ago to promote skyhigh nuclear weapons spending continue to be wielded to this day . The 21stcentury arms complex employs tools of influence that Kennedy and his compatriots would have found familiar indeed indeed . The weapons industry and the rest of the militaryindustrial complex tries to control and focus public debate is by funding hawkish think tanks . The argument remains remarkably potent in states and communities that are particularly dependent on the Pentagon . A nuclear geography ensures that a striking number of congressional representatives will automatically favor more spending on nuclear weapons . In reality the jobs argument is deeply flawed as the experts know virtually any other activity into which such funding flowed would create significantly more jobs than Pentagon spending would create much more jobs . Think of it as intellectual money laundering. Think of Frank Gaffney, a prominent purveyor of his work for Star Wars continues to be felt in the impact of his promotional work for the Pentagon but he wasn’t left this day but he has left the impact in the Reagan administration’s Strategic Defense Initiative aka ‘Star Wars8221” continues to feel in the way the ‘innovative’ approach is felt in terms of its
---  Bush has been forced to admit that he made a gaffe in his prewar State of the Union address in January where he made the case for war was wrong . The White House has conceded that part of Bush8217s speech was wrong in January . The evidence that Bush cited for the nuclear weapons was a British dossier that proved to be based on a crude forgery that the CIA had already debunked . White House spin goes something like this OK fine the evidence was forged and the president should not have said what he said . He simply made a bad judgement call based on what he knew at the time But Wilson says that he went to Niger on order from the Office of the Vice President and that the top reaches of the Bush administration must have heard about the phoniness he discovered . There are reports from other intelligence sources cited by NPR and the New York Times that suggest that the VP did in fact know the uranium evidence was bogus . The president has a pattern of using excessive language in his speeches and that many of his chief advisors must have known. The only other explanation is extreme incompetence at the vice president's office or a desire to believe that was so great that it overrode all the evidence . The Democrats are trying to get some traction on this issue .  Norquist and Norquist have been pronouncing that Republicans have paved the way for 8220decades of dominance8221 in the House and the Senate . The real problem is not Norquist's doomsday prophecies but what is actually happening on the ground in Washington . In Texas Republicans have been finagling a redistricting scheme to gain up to five seats in the state House thus ending the narrow Democratic majority . The GOP has been designing a foolproof plan to exile the Dems to a political gulag for the upcoming years . The lobbyist organizations have become a crucial part of an increasingly powerful Republican political machine . Confessore compares the current Republicans to William McKinley8217s Republicans over a century ago and notes that Karl Rove is a fan of McKinley . The secret to Bush's surprising legislative success is the GOP's increasing control of Beltway influencepeddlers K Street has turned it into a weapon8221 In the Washington Monthly Nicholasconfessore draws an alarming picture of the littlenoticed Republicans lobbying the lobbyists . The lobbyists who once ran the show loyal only to the parochial interests of their employer are being replaced by party activists who are loyal first and foremost to the GOP .

---  Bernie Sanders8217 entry into the Democratic presidential primaries should be seen as his final decisive step away from democratic socialism he professes to support . He will raise some progressive demands in the primaries and then endorse the corporate Democrat Hillary Clinton . Sanders is violating the first principle of socialist politics class independence . The socialist movement learned that principle long ago when the business classes sold out the workers in the democratic revolutions of 1848 that swept across Europe and parts of Latin America . Karl Marx told exiled German revolutionaries in London in 1850amp160that the workers needed to form their own party to look out for their own interests Even where there is no prospect whatsoever of them being elected the workers must put up their own candidates in order to preserve their independence . Sanders does a disservice to Debs memory and his commitment to workingclass political independence by displaying a Debs portrait in his office . The Socialist Party of America put into its constitution a ban against endorsing the candidates of the capitalist parties in 1904 presidential candidate Eugene Debs . Debs said The Republican and Democratic parties represent the capitalist class in the capitalist system and that is always no matter how long as it is a distinct workers party so long As it is no matterHow long it is how long it can so long as long as  Sanders has attracted significant money and energy from progressives in the first 24 hours after his announcement his campaign reported raising 15 million from donors and signing up over 100,000 volunteers . The independent left is now debating how to relate to the Sanders campaign . The left has been engaged in a pathetic and hopeless attempt at political ventriloquism . By failing to act on its own and speak for itself in US elections the left committed political suicide It lost its independent voice and its platform from which to be heard The public dont hear from the left in elections They only hear from procapitalist Democrats who most of 8220the left8221 promotes as the lesser evil to the Republicans . Sanders has a long record of supporting Democrats for president including Gore Kerry and Obama while harshly criticizing independent challengers on the left like Ralph Nader . Some states would prevent him from the debates for being barred from the primary ballots for being disloyal to the Democrats . If the Democrats would bar him from running as an independent as a Democrat after the primaries they would have prevented him from getting on the ballot . The Greens have 21 ballot lines already already secured by petitioning in 2015 and most of the rest can be secured by the rest of 2015 and Jill Steins can do so for so .

Glenn Greenwald told Democracy Now today that Glenn Greenwald spoke with Snowden and Snowden said that Snowden's greatest fear was that he would not be able to come forward with his revelations was that the U.S. would go that far just on simply an accusation that it was harboring Edward Snowden when in fact that was not the truth NOOR Glenn Greenwald says that Snowden is pleased that the president himself looked forward to the debate but his answer is to go after him with everything he has got including the forcedown of the Boliviant president of Bolivias airplane .

A declassified but heavily redacted secret report covering the years 20122017 and acquired via the Freedom of Information Act FOIA details nearly 20 programs and activities 8212 from training exercises to security cooperation engagements 8212 utilized by SOCAFrICA across the continent . The presidentelect has said or tweeted little about Africa in recent years aside from long trading in baseless claims that the current president was born there .

The U.S. has also deployed American deployments in Cameroon Djibouti and Niger efforts aimed at countering Joseph Kony 8217s murderous Kony .

President Obama issued his latest biannual 8220war powers letter also mentioned American forces supporting forces supporting local allied troops in South Sudan and supporting military observers in Egypt and supporting citizens in South Africa .  SOCAFRICA8217s showcase effort for instance is Flintlock an annual training exercise in Northwest Africa involving elite American European European and African forces . Flintlock is a small part of a sprawling mass of programs that overlie and intersect with each other 8212 indicates the existence of one or more other training exercises . JCET missions are a backdoor method of expanding US military influence and contacts in Africa since they allow for 8220incidentaltraining benefits to  accrue to the foreign friendly forces at no cost . US Africa Command did not respond to requests for comment on these exercises or other questions related to this article such as whether the true number of these missions the US conducts in Africa is unknown 8212 even to the military commands involved . The US also utilizes a confusing tangle of State Department and Pentagon programs and activities aimed at local allies that operate under a crazy quilt of funding schemes monikers and acronyms and monikers . The Pentagon and State Department programs are designed to operate inform and influence foreign target audiences as well as the local allies as appropriately authorized .

The head of Russia8217s Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev the first Russian official to suggest a possibility of a joint oil output deal with OPEC two years ago in Davos said Moscow and Riyadh should be coordinating oil policies for many more years . Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering extending an alliance on oil curbs which began in January 2017 after oil prices crashed . Saudi Arabia recruited Russia and other producers to collaborate with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries when oil prices collapsed from over 100 a barrel in 2014 to below 30 in 2016 Crude has recovered to 70 but fastrising output from US shale producers has capped prices .

---  President Obama exaggerates the potential benefits of his ambitious plan for universal preschool as he first outlined in the State of the Union and repeated elsewhere since then . Obama is extrapolating the results of small expensive programs and applying them to universal state programs . Academics who have studied preschool programs say it is too soon to know the longterm results of statewide universal programs but evidence suggests Obama8217s plan to include all 4yearold kids 8212 including those from middleincome families 8212 would not see nearly as dramatic results . The full extent of Obama's plan may not become apparent until he releases a proposed budget in midMarch . Obama continues to tout 8220preschool for all8221 However it also remains to be seen exactly how universal his proposal will end up being According to the details of his plan released by the White House Obama 8220is proposing a new federalstate partnership to provide all low and moderateincome fouryear old children those from families at or below 200 percent of poverty level with high quality preschool with highquality preschool with programs . In Georgia program 8212 found that 8220disadvantaged children residing in small towns and rural areas8221 benefited the most But the study8217 was found to be the most . The White House sent along a  There are disagreements in academia about the longterm effects of preschool programs . Head Start program 8212 has shown initial positive impacts but Head Start has shown very few impacts in any of the four domains of cognitive socialemotional health and parenting practices . Georgia and Oklahoma programs have shown promising academic results especially in the few years after preschool and particularly for disadvantaged students . Most of the claims about the benefits of preschool are based on research on the Perry preschool program and the Carolina Abecedarian Project in Chapel Hill NC which also targeted children from lowincome families . The costs of the program today 302 million in 20072008 greatly outweigh the benefits in terms of potential increased taxable revenue . In 2008 Maria Donovan Fitzpatrick then a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Economic Policy Research at Stanford University did a research paper looking atamp160 the program in Georgia the first state as Obama said to offer universal preschool . She concluded that while the economic benefits for disadvantaged children were clear they were less so for middleincome kids .

---  There are roughly 1000 drone pilots known in the trade as 822018Xs8221 working for the US Air Force today . Another 180 pilots graduate annually from a training program that takes about a year to complete at Holloman and Randolph Air Force bases in respectively New Mexico and Texas . In those same 12 months about 240 trained pilots quit in record numbers and the Air Force is at a loss to explain the phenomenon . The pilots themselves say that it8217s humiliating to be scorned by their Air Force colleagues as secondclass citizens . They typically 8220fly8221 missions over Afghanistan and Iraq where they are tasked with collecting photos and video feeds as well as watching over US soldiers on the ground A select few are deputized to fly CIA assassination missions over Pakistan Somalia or Yemen . Some of these pilots have also taken part in the new war in the Syrian and Iraqi borderlands conducting deadly strikes on militants of ISIL . Some have also come forward to claim that the horrors of war seen up close on video screens day in day out are inducing an unprecedented longdistance version of posttraumatic stress syndrome syndrome syndrome . Some even claim that drone pilots themselves even shared by drone pilots have even shared a sense of dishonor in fighting from behind a screen in the sky  The Air Force has come up with a pallid interim 8220solution to offer experienced drone pilots a daily raise of about 50 . Only a handful of drone pilots with enough years of experience to qualify for this bonus . Some 18Xs say that their jobs are tougher and significantly more upfront and personal than those of the far more glamorous jet pilots . Some say that the drone war has driven them over the edge and that drone pilots are overworked heroes . Military psychologists have been asked to investigate the phenomenon . Many drone pilots however defend their role in targeted killings however . The value that the weapon system brings to the fight is not apparent till youre there People have a hard time sometimes seeing that . The only drone strike to publicly be released is that of an actual Air Force drone surveillance mission and to publicly publicly . The drone strikes to publicly and publicly to publicly publicly to publicly reveal that the pilots are not just killing too well too well. with no real consideration to the damage being caused with no consideration of the damage caused by the drone strikes. The only one thing is clear the pilots have been recorded between idle chatter between idle chat logs recorded between drone operators and idle chatter. The drone pilots.

---  The world of the 8220US Intelligence Community8221 or IC as a nearperfect closed system and rare success story in twentyfirstcentury Washington .

You listen in on your citizenry and gather their communications in staggering quantities . Your employees even morph into avatars and enter videogame landscapes lest any Americans betray a penchant for evil deeds while in entertainment mode .

American intelligence has as far as we can tell regularly been one step late and one assessment short when not simply blindsided by events . The Obama administration often seems in a state of eternal surprise at developments across the globe . The IC seems not to have predicted the group's rapid growth or spread nor though there was at least some prior knowledge of the decline of the Iraqi army did anyone imagine that such an American created trained and armed force would so summarily collapse . The CIA in particular found itself high and dry when IS militants suddenly swept across northern Iraq the CIA .

---  The 8220Nashville Statement8221 a controversial document championing 8220biblical8221 sexual ethics was penned this past week and signed by roughly 150 prominent evangelical leaders . The statement triggered outrage almost immediately especially among LGBTQ and LGBTQaffirming Christians who saw it as a direct attack on their understanding of the faith . Some progressive Christian groups issued their own counterstatements refuting the evangelical document pointbypoint with some deriding it as 8220antiLGBTQ bigotry . The Nashville Statement is the culmination of a yearslong push to make antiLGBTQ theology obligatory for evangelical leadership or even membership . Evangelical Christian groups have been ostracized or financially threatened simply for entertaining support for marriage equality . Many evangelicals argue that just serving LGBTQ people can be a violation of their religious principles . Yet even as rightwing Christians a group that includes evangelicals as well as conservative Catholics and other groups have trumpeted these beliefs their moderate and progressive cohorts have broken up in a very different direction . The shift has been especially peculiar as once fought wars with each other over theological disputes with each different theological groups that once fought over religious grounds with each of each other found common disputes with other different theological Protestants in Europe and the United States . White evangelicals have suddenly found themselves the minority  Nashville Statement is not a document that is seriously interested with the witnesses of the Christian past nor is it interested in engaging seriously with the issues underlying marriage and gender identities of the present . Many early Christian communities were far less dogged in their support for marriage Instead they often preferred celibacy 8220 While some scriptural passages and community practices arguably ostracized LGBTQ people Moss and others said such disagreements weren’t central to what it meant to be Christian . The idea that you have to condemn LGBTQ to be a Christian is not older than LGBTQamp160advocacy8221 Scholars say conservative Christian Christian condemnations of transgender identities are spurious . This process will never be over8221 and the Nashville Statement will not revisit the ancient texts of these ancient texts which are also put with God's holy purposes when they are put in the context of these holy purposes, according to experts . The Nashville Statement was put to the test to be put with the test before the test and that the Bible is put to test Christian communities and that it will not be over. This process is never put over. and in some ways very reactive. Scholars deny that God’s holy purposes are spurious. This is also spurious. and that when God is not put with

Obama was not talking about the capandtrade legislation that has since passed in the House when he referred to energy costs necessarily skyrocketting . Palin claimed that she vetoed a 25 million earmark for energy conservation available through the stimulus because Alaska would have needed to adopt universal energy building codes to be eligible for the funds . Palin also claimed that Obama is palling around with terrorists in an October 5 2008 speech to which Palin is presumably referring she cited that days New York Times article in claiming that the two men do not appear to have been close . There is no indication that Obama 47 has played down his contacts with Ayers and that other Obama associates are now in terrorist activity or that they protect Obama or protect babies born alive after botched abortions . Palin writes that Obama opposed laws that would have amended the Illinois criminal code prohibits killing children and said that the Illinois attorney general at an office investigating allegations that fetuses born in botched abortions would be a threat to abortion rights at an attorney general . She also wrote that there is nothing to suggest that Ayers is involved in an ongoing relationship or that other other Obama supporters are protected by  Palin falsely suggests that Alaskans do not engage in the aerial hunting of wolves which Palin falsely suggested Alaskan hunters do not do . Despite circulated circulated Photoshopped images of me drawing a bead on a wolf from the air . Palin introduced a bill to simplify and clarify Alaskas intensive management law for big game and the states same day airborne hunting law in 2007 . In fact McCain Palin and rest of campaign advanced ridiculous ACORNObama conspiracy theories . Palin mocks the political buckshot her critics fired at her writing . Palin writes that the mortgage crisis that triggered the collapse of our financial markets was rooted in a wellmeaning but wrongheaded desire to increase home ownership among people who could not yet afford to own a home . She also writes Government cannot force financial institutions to give loans to people who cant afford to pay them back and then expect that somehow things will all magically work out Sooner or later reality catches up with us . Palin warns that she warned her daughter not to open her own small business because the Democrat would dictate how you should invest in your own small company or even offer the kind of health insurance and what kind of cars you can offer and even offer your fleet of cars or even have your own fleet of vehicles in your fleet .

David Petraeus a top COINdinista general who had written his doctoral dissertation on the 8220lessons8221 of the Vietnam War was called in to settle the matter by putting those lessons to work winning the other two .

---  The Obama campaign depends on some false or dubious assumptions in its 8220Life of Julia8221 slide show . The infographic depicts a fictional woman whose life from age 3 to 67 is better under the president8217s policies than those of Republican Mitt Romney . In reality the contrasts are not so stark or simple as the Obama team would have viewers believe . Some of the more factually challenged claims involve Medicare 8212 which has been a flashpoint for both parties ever since Rep Paul Ryan a year ago released a budget document called 8220Path to Prosperity8221 which included major changes to the governmentrun health care program for senior citizens . Both claims are based on Ryan's 2011 plan 8212 not his current plan which would in fact allow Julia to choose to be covered by traditional Medicare and may or may not cost her more money Under President Obama Julia enrolls in Medicare helping her to afford preventive care and the prescription drugs she needs . The White House chose its words carefully here and didn't really promise that that Julia actually would get benefits as generous as those in the future in New York Times . We also take issue with the claim that at age 67 the fictional Julia can 8220retire comfortably8221 under Obama but Obama was prepared to make some future cuts  Social Security system8217s chief actuary analyzed last year a Senate bill that would gradually increase the age of normal retirement to 70 and institute a form of 8220progressive indexing8221 to hold down the rate of benefit growth for higherincome retirees while leaving it unchanged for those at the bottom . The analysis also found that the current system falls 54 trillion short over 75 years of financing the scheduled benefit levels that Congress has promised . Julia would probably be covered with or without the federal law because the surgery occurred 8220during college . Julia underwent surgery at age 22 but was thankfully covered by her insurance due to a provision in health care reform that lets her stay on her parents8217 coverage until she turns 26 . Under Mitt Romney Health care reform would be repealed 8212 suggesting that Julia would be without coverage if Romney repealed the law . Julia might well receive free prenatal care from maternal prenatal care and free prenatal screenings under the new insurance exchanges under the health care law . The Obama campaign implies that that that she would not be covered anyway because Romney would repeal Obama would not provide that coverage during her pregnancy but there is an 82 percent chance Julia would not have been one of one of them in this case she would be one of the new health care exchanges .

---  A lot of gray area surrounds the political rhetoric about the White House's decision to swap Sgt Bowe Bergdahl for five Taliban figures detained at Guantanamo . Did the administration violate a decadesold policy of 8220not negotiating with terrorists8221 Was it a simple swap of prisoners of war and did President Obama violate the law by failing to notify appropriate congressional leaders of the deal 30 days in advance? We set out to factcheck some of these issues and found the reality isn't as clear as the rhetoric would lead you to believe We lay out some of the facts and let you draw your own conclusions .

The Pakistani Taliban are a frequent target of the U.S. drone campaign The TTP  Defense Secretary Hagel flatly flatly denied that the US negotiated with terrorists but called the swap part of a normal process in getting your prisoners of war back . The US conducted all of its negotiations directly with the government of Qatar acting as an intermediary . The swap was not a negotiation with al Qaeda the terrorist group responsible for the Sept 11 attacks . The Afghan Taliban itself is not on the US list of terrorist organizations . The Haqqani Network was added to the State Department list of foreign terrorist organizations in September 2012 . Despite this parsing the deal had to satisfy both the US and the Afghan Taliban which was the chief negotiator of the swap .

He has written hundreds of articles on the question of Palestine in major publications including The New York Times The Guardian and for Al Jazeera . He says abolishing the racism and violence of Zionism practices against Palestinians is the key to justice and peace in historic Palestine no less than the abolition of slavery and Jim Crow in the United States were absolutely necessary recent American history demonstrates that systems of racial control and the ideologies underpinning them remain robust and adaptable A formally liberal and rightsbased order can allow a system just as oppressive as Jim Crow to hide and flourish in plain sight . He argues that it includes things like a really racialized view of the world where Palestinians in the case of Israel and African Americans Latinos and other people of color in the U.S. are viewed as some kind of demographic threat that needs to be policed and controlled and surveilled And that serves as a warning for Palestinians that you know even if they achieve full liberal rights in a single state they may not get out from under the yoke of racism and oppression and apartheid . He writes about the hypermilitarization of  In terms of learning from the AfricanAmerican struggle I mean one of the things that tipped the balance in terms of equality of rights under the law was the civil rights movement in the 1960s . But what Im saying is its insufficient Its necessary but insufficient You cant just declare everyone equal and then move on because its notyou know the injustice JAY And you can see that incompr clearly in South Africa where they declared everyone equal but now you havein fact in fact the actual livingquality of living and quality of living is actually worse now than it was under apartheid ABUNIMAH Thats right and thats another example I discuss in the book where I think a lesson for Palestinians is that economic justice and economic democracy restitution redistribution have to be front and center and not just left as they have been both in the case of civil rights in the U.S. and ending apartheid in the South Africa as an afterthought as a result because the reality is it hasnt And we cant afford to repeat that JAY . But I think that in a sense the way Palestinians have found now to catalyze not just a sense of . Palestinians are going out protesting every week against the confiscation of land is through boycott divestment and sanctions is through boycotts and sanctions .

---  The Watergate scandal that took down Richard Nixon shook up American politics over four decades later we are now seeing another scandal associated with campaign officials . New intelligence intercepts reveal that Attorney General Jeff Sessions discussed aspects of the Trump campaign with a Russian ambassador . With the initiative to impeach Trump put out there are we approaching another Watergate moment . The idea that Vladimir Putin intervened in the US election by working with Julian Assange was perhaps a strategically convenient plot for the Democrats to deflect the real issues and distract others from their own failures . This all sounds very familiar with Ralph Nader's Green Party candidacy in 2010 when the corporate media adamantly attacked Nader as if he took on the auto industry in the 1960s for lax safety regulation might then be taking on the unregulated defective engine of a concocted political system that is itself unsafe at any speed with either party . Nader explained the false schemes of the closed system of control and deconstructed system of deconstructed and decade of decadence of decline of the Democratic Party in 2010 . There is a parallel of what Nader did in his 2010 interview on The Intercept detailed how the media did in a recent interview with Nader and how he explained how he deconstructed the system of decades of decadence of the  Clinton campaign's internal workings revealed a strategy to actively elevate far right bigoted presidential candidates in order to increase Clinton8217s chance of winning . The doctrine of the lesser of two evils grips the liberal class making not only the electoral arena dysfunctional but an efficient machine to seize the will of the populace . The corporate media fed the story of a RussiaTrump connection with a twist of WikiLeaks as the culprit . By shooting the messenger attention was diverted from the vital message itself by the corporate media . Hackingagate might be one of the great scandals of our decade . Yet before we jump onto the bandwagon with this political hype we might need to question the unexamined assumptions in the whole story that reversion to the cold era of the old Cold era and this reversion of the Cold era that reverts to Russia and this quickversion of this story that points at the old Soviet era . These include examining the reasons why Americans should be afraid of Russia and a real assessment that Russia is not a real threat in the real assessment of whether that assessment that is that Russia has ever posed any real threat to the real world is that we need to jump into the hype and this story . And Our Humanity of Russiarity of our Humanity of Our Humanity is .

---  Shares of major US airlines plummeted on Wednesday as investors reacted to growing concerns of an industry fare war triggered by a decision from United Continental Holdings Inc UALN to increase capacity and compete headtohead with budget carriers . The dramatic drop in the share price is the second such fall in as many quarters as the Chicagobased airline has struggled to maintain control of its US hub cities amid increased competition from budget airlines . The bulk of investor concerns lie in United8217s decision to beef up its capacity by between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2018 and at a similar clip in 2019 and 2020 on the grounds that it would give the carrier an edge in its fight against competitors . Investor concerns of a widespread fare war carried over to rival shares as well sending American Airlines AALO stocks down 6 percent and Delta Air Lines DALN down 522 percent . The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy in the Delaware court listing 500 million to 1 billion in liabilities and said it struck a deal with an affiliate of private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners to acquire its assets . The studio's ex-Chairman Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault allegations that may have silenced some women including rape and assault against some women . The company said it ended all nondisclosure agreements  The Trump administration is said to be preparing tariffs against Chinese information technology telecommunications and consumer products in an attempt to force changes in Beijing8217s intellectual property and investment practices . Washington could impose more than 60 billion in tariffs on goods from electronics to apparel footwear and toys . In a separate letter to Trump on Monday 82 shoe companies including Nike Inc Genesco Payless ShoeSource Inc Under Armour Shoe Carnival Inc and Weyco Group echoed those concerns . The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the letter . The letter is the latest example of the growing division between the Trump administration and many in the business community over trade policy . Wall Street's main indexes fell more than 15 percent as investors worried about a potential trade war and as Facebook shares dragged down the tech sector . Oil prices slipped on Monday as Wall Street slid more than 1 percent to end at 6206 a barrel and energy market investors remained wary of growing crude supply . Still, the US drill count remains a potential headwind for oil bulls US drillers last week bringing the total rig count to 800 rigs last week to 800 in the US oil rig count up to 800 . US oil production has risen to 1038 million barrels per day since mid-2016 mid-2014
---  Karl von Clausewitz the famed Prussian military thinker is best known for his aphorism 8220War is continuation of state policy by other means8221 But what happens to a war in the absence of coherent state policy? The latest American war was launched as a humanitarian mission to save the Yazidis a group few Americans had heard of until then from genocide at the hands of the Islamic State IS Within weeks however a fullscale bombing campaign was underway against IS across Iraq and Syria with its own 8220coalition of the willing8221 and 1600 US military personnel on the ground Slippery slope It was Tefloncoated Think of what transpired as several years of early Vietnamera escalation compressed into a semester And in that time what8217s gone right Short answer Almost nothing. The US has gone to great pains to point out just how many IS fighters its air strikes have killed there Exactly 464 according to a UKbased human rights group a number so specific as to be suspect but no matter As history suggests body counts in this kind of war mean little And that folks is the 8220good news8221 Now hold on because here is the bad news amp160 That Coalition The US Department of State lists 60 participants in the coalition of nations behind the US efforts  Washington now hopes to recreate the Anbar Awakening and bring the same old Sunnis into the new new Iraq while chasing out IS the 8220new8221 alQaeda alQaeda . The State Department is now playing up the idea of creating a whole new military force a Sunni 8220national guard . These units would after all be nothing more than renamed Sunni militias and would in no way be integrated into the Iraqi Army instead they would remain in Sunni territory under the command of local leaders . Washington generally acts as if these various chaotically conflicting outfits can be coordinated across borders like so many chess pieces President Obama however is no Dwight Eisenhower on DDay at Normandy pointing the British to one objective the Canadians to another ultimately linking up with the French resistance en route to the liberation of Paris . In the end the US will either have to withdraw from Iraq yet again or cede the western part of the country to IS or place many many boots on the ground you need look no further than the strategic incoherence of its various fractious 8220coalitions in Iraq Syria and globally . The Islamic State Unlike the US the Islamic State has a coherent strategy and it has the initiative and the IS has a truly brutal and bloody hearts and mindstype campaign massacring Sunnis

The deal is expected to be announced as early as Monday by the end of the year in the region of South Carolina-South Carolina-Air Force Base . The U.S. Air Force Force Base.  Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them . The first quarter draws to a close and what a quarter it has been Investors have had a lot thrown at them from the biggest ever rise in stock market volatility to rapidly escalating tensions over global trade deepening tumult in the White House and tech sector wobbles . But some experienced analysts suggest that the rout in stocks may not point to panic over a fullscale trade war . The final US government read on fourth quarter GDP on Wednesday will come hot on the heels of the Federal Reserve8217s first interest rate hike of the year . High expectations for European stocks in 2018 have not been met . Euro zone and UK business confidence data due out next week will either inflame or soothe concerns that the region's economic momentum may be to wane . The French popularity of French President Emmanual Macron starting the year with a strong mandate to reform labor markets has now hit antime low in the polls . The European CAC index is now down 4040 share index index is down 40 percent from 5 percent from last May but that is still better than the pan-European Stoxx 600 has lost the underlying European Stox 600 .
---  US foreign policy8217s point of equilibrium is effectively being determined by Republican phobias Iran Cuba Cuba Venezuela Venezuela Venezuela and Russia Syria endorsed by most Republicans . Saudi Arabia and Israel are the only countries on better terms with the US since Trump's arrival in the White House on 20amp160January Trump is not solely responsible for this increased tension . Current US paranoia about everything Kremlinrelated has encouraged amnesia about what President Barack Obama said in Syria and the Mideast . He too put the danger posed by the interventions posed by President Vladimir Putin into perspective and the Middle East and the response to a client state that was about to slip out of his grasp 8216in his grasp . Trump is completely indifferent to global public opinion and operates like a horse trader looking for the best deal for himself and his voters irrespective of consequences elsewhere . The problem of military alliances is not so much that they risk amplifying conflicts rather than discouraging them but that they cost the American taxpayer too much as a result of picking up the tab the US is becoming a third world nation 8216. Obama said Obama went on 8216 in his grasp8216in response to his response to an improvised response to the Russian intervention to a state that went on his own response to Obama .  As in Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express everyone had his particular motive for striking the same victim . The press feared that Trump8217s incompetence would threaten the USdominated international order . The architects of recent US imperial adventures especially Iraq had not enjoyed the 2016 campaign or Trump's jibes about their expertise . So they were searching for any information or rumour that could cause his removal or force a resignation . Glenn Greenwald who broke the Edward Snowden story that revealed mass surveillance programmes run by the National Security Agency warned of the direction of travel . The antiRussian coalition hadn't achieved all its objectives but Greenwald already discerned the ambitions of a 8216deep state8217deep state . This at a time when Democrats still reeling from their unexpected and traumatic election loss are willing 8212 eager 8212 to embrace any claim cheer any tactic align with any villain regardless of how unsupported tawdry and damaging those behaviours might be. The suspicion of such a murky understanding summed up by Paul Krugman as a proClinton economist Paul Krugman . For the first time in history in Russia, Russia has freely chosen its leader to prepare for conflict with those of those those who are preparing for conflict for those those involved in the US. There is almost remaining resistance for Russia
---  Abdel Baset alMegrahi the Libyan sentenced in 2001 to 27 years in prison for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie Scotland was released from incarceration by the Scottish government on 8220compassionate grounds . William Calley was sentenced to life in prison in 1971 as a young lieutenant for the massacre of civilians in the Vietnamese village of My Lai . Calley admitted at trial to killing Vietnamese civilians personally but served only three years of house arrest following an intervention by President Richard Nixon . The lack of comment on Calley underscores a longstanding American aversion to facing what the US did to Vietnam and its people during a war that ended more than 30 years ago . Since then one coverup of mass murder after another has unraveled and bubbled into view These have included the mass killing of civilians at the Mekong Delta village of Thanh Phong by future senator Bob Kerrey and the SEAL team he led exposed by the New York Times Magazine and CBS News in 2001 a long series of atrocities including murders torture and mutilations involving the deaths of hundreds of noncombatants largely committed in Quang Ngai Province where Calley is also located by an elite US unit the Tiger Force was exposed in 2003 . Over the last decade  Calley8217s belated remorse evidences a sense of responsibility that his superiors 8212 from his company commander Capt Ernest Medina to his commanderinchief President Lyndon Johnson 8212 never had the moral fiber to shoulder . Despite ample opportunity offered no apologies he stayed silent despite ample opportunity to offer no apologies . A few weeks after McNamara's death Julian Ewell a top Army general who served in two important command roles in Vietnam also passed away For years the specter of atrocity had swirled around him but only among a select community of veterans and Vietnam War historians . A Pentagonlevel coverup and Newsweek's desire not to upset the Nixon administration in the wake of the My Lai revelations kept the full results of the meticulous investigation by Buckley and Shimkin bottled up bottled up . Newsweek published a severely truncated version of their article allowed the Pentagon to ride out the coverage without being forced to convene a largescale official inquiry of the publication of the full version of the investigation . Ewell will be buried with full military service at Arlington following a memorial service in October following a full military burial .

Maria has killed at least seventeen people and devastated several small islands including St Croix in the US Virgin Islands and Dominica . The Trump Administration is denying all connection between these extreme weather events and climate strange despite the overwhelming expert evidence to the contrary . Instead of ramping down fossil fuel production the Trump Administration appears hellbent on ramping it up the way in which it appears to do that is by opening up the Arctic Wildlife National Refuge to oil drilling .

---  This week the Obama administration released the details of its plan to stimulate the flow of credit and reduce the cost of borrowing by subsidizing the purchase of mortgage and other debtbacked securities . The plan is designed to encourage socalled publicprivatepartnerships PPPs between private investors and the US government in an arrangement in which the US Treasury will put up billions in lowinterest nearly risk free loans to private investors willing to purchase the toxic assets now politely dubbed 8216legacy assets8217 by the administration . The idea is that if investors can be enticed into buying these debt instruments then the banks will be able to move them off of their balance sheets and begin issuing new loans to consumers in turn helping to stimulate demand that has fallen off sharply since the bursting of the housing bubble . The market for such debtfueled demand has completely dried up since the onset of the crisis . There are significant problems with each of these assumptions and I will deal with them in turn with the plan in turn . The current plan will no doubt continue the trend in the redistribution of wealth toward the wealthy toward the rich and the foreign governments will continue to do so regardless of the huge imbalances that have been growing for a half a decade . The government is taking on almost all of the  The IMF has estimated that US bank losses on bad assets will reach 22 trillion while Nouriel Rubini has revised his estimate upward to 36 trillion . China has begun questioning the stability of the US dollar . China is concerned about the safety of our assets in the US, says Chinese premier Jaibo . The hope is that once the government plan jumpstarts the market for these securities the engine of debtcreation and speculation on debtderivatives will start turning over in turn stimulating creditdriven demand . But this will probably prove to be wishful thinking as the problem facing the global economy runs deeper than the financial sector . The bubbles of the last ten years must be seen as a direct result of the overproduction that has plagued the manufacturing sector since the beginning of the economic downturn8217 in 1973, says economist Robert Brenner . In the US Western Europe and Japan has steadily deteriorated business cycle by business cycle in terms of every standard macroeconomic indicator 8212 GDP investment real wages and so forth . The US turned to a policy of low interest rates and easy money policies that allowed consumers to take on unprecedented debts driving up asset prices and increasing asset prices in the past ten years is a direct consequence of the boom .

His group stocked the place with hastily purchased chickens geared up the machinery and put on a dogandpony er chickenandrooster show . In the dark humor of that moment we christened the place the Potemkin Chicken Factory . In keeping with the madness of the times however the simple fact that the plant failed to meet any of its realworld goals did not mean the project wasn't a success In fact the factory was a hit with the US media . It transformed nothing empowered no one stabilized and economically uplifted not a single Iraqi It just sat there empty dark and unused in the middle of the desert Like the chickens we were plucked in the desert like the chickens they were plucking . The US spent some 22 million dollars to build a huge facility in the boondocks. It failed to account for a lack of regular electricity or logistics systems to bring the chickens to and from the plant or working capital or . working capital . The plant was a small amount in a small but 22 million .

In Chicago the Fraternal Order of Police FOP a longtime supporter of racist police torturer Jon Burge is now seeking to circumvent court orders to preserve and make public the police misconduct files of repeater cops such as Burge by seeking to enforce a police contract provision that calls for the destruction of the files after seven years .

---  Republican frontrunners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have both promised to deport every last one of the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States the whole lot of them while as a bonus banning Muslims from the country . The highest number of people ever deported from the U.S. in a given year is 237941 . Trump or Cruz would have to almost match seven-fold increase in deportations on a truly monumental scale of 237,000 deportations . The more question in the grim world of deportations would be whether one of them even get back to the high figure is whether any president could actually restore such high deportation rates today . In reality police departments have been moving away from such enforcement due to the real limitations on local cooperation from local criminal law enforcement which is likely to require cooperation from federal law enforcement to ramping up deportations again . Tom Engelhardt says the promise to deport millions is unlikely to restore the promise of millions as it happens again would require local cooperation with local law enforcement from criminal law . The most serious question is whether one deportation would actually restore the high deportation rate today is whether it would be restored to the record high of 237k deportations under the promise from local police cooperation . The best deportation rate is when one deportations  There are currently about 5000 ICE agents in the U.S. Their capacity with limited cooperation from local law enforcement seems at the moment to be about 70000 deportations a year . To get those deportations back above 200000 would involve gargantuan and expensive efforts and a restoration of the frayed relationship between ICE and local police departments . In the real world locating and then arresting the undocumented is anything but a straightforward process . The next President could revisit the worksite enforcement strategies implemented during the Bush years to find undocumented workers such raids have proven even less effective and efficient than home raids . In sum President Obama has done about as much damage as is presently possible to undocumented migrants and their families within these legal and judicial processes . Trump and Cruz's claims that they will do significantly more are baseless are baseless unless the American American were even then achieving their goals would prove unlikely in even then in the fundamental ways and then then in constraints constraints to be changed in even in the American system to be even than the extreme extreme walls and Other Walls and Other Fantasies . Addressing the border wall would be an even greater and more literal edifice of this edifice than the Great Wall of China is slated to cover the southern border sport all the latest in surveillance technology and as

Five male freshmen alleged that Munoz used his positions as an upperclassman class president and head of the campus Republican Society to grope them . A local prosecutor reviewed the case and declined to seek an indictment Munoz's hiring raises questions about the vetting of political appointees which has been both slow and spotty with multiple incidents of staff being fired only weeks into their jobs including for disloyalty to Trump . The White House didn8217t respond to a request for comment Munoz denied the allegations and said he would not have known about the 2010 allegation because of privacy law . A Citadel spokeswoman Kim Keelor said the committee that gave the award would not know about the case because of the 2010 allegations about Munoz had not been aware of the case . The Citadel said the award was given to Munoz and the case would not be known about it because of a Citadel spokeswoman said of the award given to a committee that would not need to know about it . The school later conducted its investigation it interviewed complainants and witnesses and concluded in 2014 that  The first incident reported to the school took place in April 2009 as Munoz then a sophomore and a freshman were at an offcampus house watching TV and consensually spooning . The freshman later woke up in the middle of the night with Munoz on top of him kissing him with his tongue in his mouth . Munoz had his left hand down the other student's shorts touching his penis . The student reported that incident to a Citadel official Sexual Assault Response Coordinator Janet Shealy in February 2010 . The reporting student told Shealy he didn't want to do anything but informal8221 according to her notes School officials set up a mediation session in which Munoz and other student met in a conference room In that meeting Munoz 8220said it was consensual and that accuser started it8221 The other student left 8220upset8221 Munoz was warned and told to write a statement about what happened .

Most Republicans defend the name as they do other Native Americanbased team names such as the college football champion Florida State Seminoles calling them tokens of 8220honor8221 A study8230 confirmed that the name of the Washington Redskins is only offensive if you take any amount of time whatsoever to think about its actual meaning8221 So what's keeping Republicans from thinking about it is Republicans wearing a set of blinders crafted and actively maintained by the party's functionaries and its media priesthood . Republicans also suffer from mental roadblocks shared by American whites more generally including a thin often mythbased 8220knowledge8221 about Native Americans . TomDispatch offers a breakdown on why Republican Blinders Blinder 1 and explains how the party is facing a demographic time bomb at home and abroad and why they let their media minions form an offensive line to protect the Redskins name protect the name . A big reason why conservatives don8217t like change is the people who push for it and the people pushing for it is liberals foaming at the mouth about relativism preaching white guilt and feelbadness .  There are at least three mental roadblocks in the way of Republicans coming to terms with the impact of 8220Redskins8221 not to speak of racism itself Unlike the blinders these roadblocks are shared by white Americans across the political spectrum . There are of course other reasons why so many Republicans are blind to the wrongness of the Redskins name that can’8217t be blamed on the GOP There are also mental roadblock 1 Naming Practices and 900 teams with Native Americanbased names and mascots in this country Of them some 900 remain . Roadblock 2 A MythBased 8220Education8221 It8217s easy to say that a name honors a culture when you don’t know anything about that culture and people don”t know nothing about the size or nature of Native American communities here when you’ve been taught in school Children put on feathers and construction paper cutouts in holiday plays that teach a mythology for Columbus Day and Thanksgiving . The Redskins team name dates to the early 1930s and people often think that it’s wrong unless they feel the sting or someone makes a stink and people may think that a word like 8220redskin8221 as a team name is verboten in conversation .

The United States is bound by treaty to come to the assistance of Japan or the Philippines if either country is attacked by a third party so any armed clash between Chinese and Japanese or Filipino forces could trigger American military intervention . Leaders on all sides continue to affirm their country8217s inviolable rights to the contested islands and vow to use any means necessary to resist encroachment by rival claimants . China has increased the frequency and scale of its naval maneuvers in waters claimed by Japan Vietnam and the Philippines further enflaming tensions in the region . The seabeds surrounding them are believed to sit atop vast reserves of oil and natural gas . Ownership of the islands would naturally confer ownership of the islets would naturally grant ownership of some of the reserves of natural gas and oil and oil . The Chinese believe that the islands are part of their national territory and the fact that the fact of a rival claimant to them only adds a tinge of victimhood to a powerful victimhood  A new leadership team is placing renewed emphasis on military strength and on what might be called national assertiveness in China . In Japan and the U.S. senior officials are debating implementation of the 8220 Pacific pivot8221 announced by President Obama in a speech before the Australian Parliament a little over a year ago . President Obama promised that additional US forces would be deployed in the region even if that meant cutting resources was necessary to maintain a strong presence in this region . While war clouds gather in the Pacific sky the question remains Why pray tell is this happening now? Several factors seem to be conspiring to heighten the risk of confrontation including leadership changes in China and Japan and a geopolitical reassessment by the United States . The Chinese clearly have little intention of backing down having indicated that they will increase their air and naval deployments in the area just as the Japanese are doing Powder Keg in the the area . Inevitably this will spark a harsh Chinese response8212and because the US has mutual defense treaties with both countries it will also increase the risk  of US involvement in future engagements at sea . It will also also increase risk of US involved in future engagement in such engagements at the region and also increase US involvement . The United States is also increasing the risk

---  In 1893 in one of the earliest May 1 celebrations Frederick Engels the collaborator with Karl Marx and a theoretical and practical leader of the workers movement of his day wrote that in London around 240000 workers gathered 100000 with the trade unions council and then another 140000 with the committee for the eighthour working day . In another place Engels writes that such politics essentially was acting like voting cattle where workers would simply vote for one as he called it bourgeois party or the other So how different are we today perhaps that same fight in the working class still goes on Perhaps that same struggle still takes place today perhaps . In Europe it seems that weve seen more of an offensive by the workers certainly much more than in North America Leo Panitch has to say despite reference to Europe where the great socialist parties emerged those parties emerged like the Democratic Party now like the German Social Social Social Democrats despite their working class roots are largely like the American Democratic Party in the American versions of the American version of the US Democratic Party . The Real News Network is now looking for a political expression of an independent political movement in Europe but weve226128148 in the U.S. and Tweedledledledum . Weve also seen mass protests in Europe despite the American Social Democratic Party  Occupy made May 1 the day for the launch of what theyre calling the American Spring some people are calling it that or that it is May 1 because theres been an attempt over the decades to marginalize May 1 as even a day of celebration . Sam and Paul say the labor movement is still lowering its expectations as Leo said and just looking to the lesser of two lessers essentially JAY The226128148yeah go ahead Leo PANITCH Well I was going to say you know you know the first Occupy after Obama got elected was the plant being closed in Chicago . And that presaged a more audacious action on the part of workers . Sam says the tide may be turning and in some ways than they even turned in the 1960s when the unions entered their very long period of evolving organizational forms that would let them take on them in 1970s which happened in the long periods of capitalist capitalist crises which happened through another rights and then 226128148of course . Paul says the unions are developing organizational means that were living through another way of developing organizational forms which were living in the 1970s and now they were living .

---  Samer Shehata is an assistant professor of Arab Politics at Georgetown University . He is the author of the book Shop Floor Culture and Politics in Egypt published in 2009 Samer has also written numerous articles on Arab politics for the International Herald Tribune Boston Globe and the Arab Reform Bulletin . Samer says there have been rising sectarian tensions in Egypt for some time and the previous regime really tried to cover up the difficulties tried to kind of hide it under the rug tried to make deals with the church The Pope was very supportive of Mr Mubarak and the regime during election time and other times because the institution of the Church and the Pope felt that Mubarak was really keeping a lid on Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood . The previous regime didnt address some legitimate grievances that the Coptic Christian minority had in Egypt having to do with the restoration of churches and the building of churches . The military is deliberately hanging back in terms of its enforcement of the law on the streets. Samer is also taking advantage of this to call for an Islamic state to persecute Christians and to try to champion Islam as it were for political gain in the new Egypt . He says the Salafis as you mentioned at the beginning are really taking advantage . The Salafists have also taken advantage of  There has been the claim that regime elements have tried to use the Salafis to sew up chaos and havoc in the country as part of whats being called the counterrevolution in Egypt . But there has been no empirical evidence of that but I wouldnt put it past elements of the regime that are still on the loose and maybe some that are actually being detained trying to produce a situation in which people look back at the Mubarak era as being one of relative stability and so on Of course I dont think thats going to happen But what can happen is an attempt to derail the revolution and the tremendous progress that has been completed at least so far in terms of democratic consolidation and moving to a really different kind of Egypt . I don't think that they are significant electorally in terms that is their electoral electoral electoral terms, and I think there is a genuine concern if there is not an anxiety about their presence in the coming electoral electoral elections . I think they are operating above the Sunni ground recently there is their weight in the kind of electoral electoral weight in coming electoral elections that is above the Salafiis' weight of their kind of influence in coming September elections. I think it is quite interesting to note because we havent seen the Salahis operating above their

---  In October of 2016 I wrote a somewhat divisive essay in which I suggested that political dissent is being systematically pathologized . In the twelve months since I wrote that piece we have been subjected to a concerted campaign of corporate media propaganda for which there is no historical precedent . Virtually every major organ of the Western media apparatus the most powerful propaganda machine in the annals of powerful propaganda machines has been churning out variations on a new official ideological narrative designed to generate and enforce conformity . The gist of this propaganda campaign is that 8220Western democracy8221 is under attack by a confederacy of Russians and white supremacists as well as 8220the terrorists8221 and other 8220extremists8221 . Government and corporate entities have been aggressively restricting and in many cases eliminating fundamental civil liberties such as freedom of expression and the right of assembly . The justification for this curtailment of rights which started in earnest in 2001 following the September 11 attacks is protecting the public from the threat of 8220terrorism8221 which apparently shows no signs of abating . As of now the United States has been inamp160 a State of Emergencyamp160 for over sixteen years The UK and France is now in the process of enshrining its permanent State of . Emergency .  The traditionalamp160ideologicalamp160paradigm Left versus Right is disappearing except as a kind of minstrel show and is being replaced or overwritten by aamp160pathologyamp160 paradigm based upon the concept of 8220extremism8221 . The term has been around since the Fifth Century BC and has come into vogue in the last three decades during the Cold War . Capitalism has no qualms with constant revisions to what is considered normal because none of them are threats to capitalism . Capitalism is an economic system which we have elevated to a social system It only has one fundamental value exchange value which isn't much of a value at least not in terms of organizing society or maintaining any sort of human culture or reverence for the natural world it exists in In capitalist society everything everyone every object and sentient being every concept and human emotion is worth exactly what the market will bear 8230 no more no less than its market price There is no other measure of value at all but there is no real cultural values with real human values with the absence of real values in a marketplace at all in a society at all at all . In capitalism everything everyone everyone everyobject and sentient human being every object is worth a marketplace in a market at all

By 1999 Regnery had come to believe that the only future for white people in North America was a reconfigured continent with a whiteonly homeland carved out of the former United States . Regnery discovered Richard Spencer the mediagenic agitator who invented the term 8220altright . Spencer with Regnery8217s support emerged as the omnipresent face of the American far right a glib talking head whose views on issues of immigration and race at times seemed only slightly more extreme than what you could read on Breitbart News or hear from Trump himself . Spencer and Regnery were struggling to jumpstart their political movement in 2014 they planned to convene what they called a European Congress of the white nationalist movement when they descended on Budapest Hungary the result was chaos and humiliation .

---  British resident and Guant225namo prisoner Binyam Mohamed has been engaged in a transatlantic struggle to secure evidence relating to his disappearance from July 2002 until his arrival at the US prison at Bagram airbase in Afghanistan in May 2004 . In June a judicial review was triggered after the Treasury Solicitors turned down a request from Mohamed8217s lawyers to release documents regarding his illegal detention in Pakistan and his subsequent disappearance . The judges were appalled by the behavior of the British intelligence services for sending agents to interrogate Mohamed in May 2002 while he was being held illegally in Pakistan . The British government was required to hand over the evidence 8212 42 documents in total 8212 to his lawyers . Mohamed claimed that the charges against him 8212 in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a radioactive 8220dirty bomb8221 in a US city had been extracted during this period through the use of torture . The U.S. government responded to the only lifeline extended by the British government saying national security concerns might override the necessity for disclosure . The American government was finally required to make the 42 documents available to Mohamed but when the day of the disclosure arrived the only seven of the documents arrived was so heavily redacted as to be useless and then dropped the  Mohamed8217s habeas case judge refused to order disclosure of 42 secret documents to Mohamed's lawyers . The judges were barely able to conceal their regard for the significance of the documents which they had been able to scrutinize over the summer during an extraordinarily detailed crossexamination of one of the agents who had visited Mohamed while he was under US supervision in a Pakistani jail in May 2002 . Judge Emmet Sullivan made a decision at the next hearing on October 30 however he made it clear that if a satisfactory conclusion was not forthcoming the High Court would reconvene in order disclosure . The British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has officially asked the Attorney General Baroness Scotland to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing by MI5 and the CIA in Mohamed 8217s case . The announcement came on the same day that in another hearing about Mohamed's review the Justice Department finally turned over the remaining 35 documents to his lawyers in the Justice Dept. to provide the documents8221 to Mohamed’s lawyers . Judge Sullivan pointedly asked why after more than years the government had stepped away from its claims about a dirty bomb plot and said that it has been public knowledge since June 2002 that the allegations were ever true and that it is not a question as a question whether or not the allegations

---  When a white male kills people in a mass shooting in the US the corporate media follow an algorithm not unlike the K252blerRoss model of the five stages of grief . When Elliot Rodger massacred six people and injured 14 more in May 2014 he was not classified as a terrorist even though he explicitly stated that his attack was motivated by an intense hatred of women . Yet because of mounting pressure and criticism from independent media activists and social media corporate media are no longer able to remain in a state of such denial . This is what separates the media response to the Charleston shooting from that of Dylann Storm Roof, who murdered nine people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston South Carolina . Some publications propagated an antithetical narrative the 8220postracial8221 myth . The Wall Street Journal went its way to claim that racism is dead and that Roof's motivation defies explanation that racism still stalks out of out of the reality that evil stalks evil .

---  MeToo presents a unique challenge for journalism as the movement continues to reveal widespread experiences of sexual harassment and assault among women . Questions must be raised about how journalists reporters writers and editors ought to handle these nowcommon stories8212 which often have been hidden in plain sight . Concerns intensified when the journalist is confronted with the use of the MeToo movement as a political tool . There is a danger in this environment that unsophisticated individuals who have been abused by powerful people could be exploited by groups seeking partisan advantage or by lawyers seeking a moment in the limelight8221 said Debra Katz a Washington lawyer who has brought sexual harassment cases against politicians from both parties 8230 And a nonprofit group founded by the Democratic activist David Brock which people familiar with say secretly spent 200000 on an unsuccessful effort to bring forward accusations of sexual misconduct against Mr Trump before Election Day is considering creating a fund to encourage victims to come forward similar claims against Republican politicians . It isn't just just just that that allows power that allows men to keep their secrets and keep their careers and secrets away from each other 8230 It is also our collective choice to see our choice to do the simple choice to choose what we see as simple and to see simple situations as simple as simple situations  A network of reporters helped Weinstein keep his reputation intact including AJ Benza a former New York Daily News gossip columnist with whom Weinstein exploited a longstanding system of favortrading between the press and the movie business .

Cochran's campaign went on the air April 2 with a 30second TV spot called 8220Only One8221 The ad stresses Cochran8217s conservative voting record on three issues guns abortion and the Affordable Care Act . The ad does not provide a time frame so a viewer may come away with the mistaken impression that Cochran voted with the NRLC on every issue . Overall Cochran is usually a reliable Republican vote but he has crossed party lines such as when he opposed restrictions on stem cell research and campaign finance legislation . McDaniel has a strong record too and his supporters argue it is that his supporters are antiabortion too and not surprisingly is that McDaniel is stronger than Cochran . The campaign does some cherrypicking with the record so the ads does not give a . time frame but Cochran has never weighed in on a statewide initiative and never weighed on the statewide ballot initiative .

Cochran has a decadeslong history of supporting such restrictions . But in every case Cochran voted for a ban on federal funding . The campaign says Cochran's vote against the Hyde amendment was on procedural grounds not because he opposed the amendment . McDaniel8217s campaign calls this a vote for 8220taxpayer funding for abortion8221 It's a claim that the campaign has made more than once and it's an exaggeration . The Hyde amendment named after former Rep Henry Hyde of Illinois was enacted in 1976 as an amendment to the appropriations bill that funds Medicaid and has been added to annual spending bills ever since But from the beginning there have been fights over the wording of the amendment and whether it should allow exceptions for cases of rape incest or endangerment of the life of the mother . In 1981 thenSen Jesse Helms sponsored an amendment that would have dropped the rape and incest exceptions added to Hyde amendment .

---  China's determination to assert control over disputed islands in the potentially energyrich waters of the East and South China Seas spells trouble not just regionally but potentially globally . The United States is bound by treaty to come to the assistance of Japan or the Philippines if either country is attacked by a third party so any armed clash between Chinese and Japanese or Filipino forces could trigger American military intervention . China has increased the frequency and scale of its naval maneuvers in waters claimed by Japan Vietnam and the Philippines further enflaming tensions in the region . Washington8217s continuing statements about its ongoing plans for a 8220pivot8221 to or 8220rebalancing8221 of its forces in the Pacific have only fueled Chinese intransigence . The seabeds surrounding them are believed to sit atop vast reserves of oil and natural gas . Ownership of the islands would naturally confer ownership of the reserves of the oil and . natural gas and energy reserves . The Chinese believe that the islands are part of their national territory and any other claims represent a direct assault on China 8212s sovereign rights the fact that Japan 8212 is a rival claimant . The U.S. is a powerful tingeinge of victimhood to some some of the victimhood .  On December 13th the Japanese military scrambled F15 fighter jets when a Chinese marine surveillance plane flew into airspace near the DiaoyuSenkaku Islands . Another worrisome incident occurred on January 8th when four Chinese surveillance ships entered Japanesecontrolled waters around those islands for 13 hours . The Chinese clearly have little intention of backing down having indicated that they will increase their air and naval deployments in the area just as the Japanese are doing Powder Keg in the Pacific . In China a new leadership team is placing renewed emphasis on military strength and on what might be called national assertiveness . The United States is debating implementation of the 8220 Pacific pivot8 pivot8221 announced by President Obama in Australia a little over a year ago . Inevitably this will spark a harsh Chinese response 8212 and because the United States has mutual defense treaties with both countries it will also increase the risk of US involvement in future engagement in future engagements at sea it is also likely to provoke a harsh response to the Chinese response to a harsh reaction to the U.S. It will also likely increase the number of additional additional US forces deployed in the region to counter growing Chinese assertiveness in the . region .

---  Barack Obama used his final press conference as president to pledge to speak up if the administration of Donald Trump crosses a line . Yet the presidents palliative remarks concealed a more harrowing truth that sweeps and forced expulsions of children would not constitute a break with norms of his own administration which oversaw more deportations than any other in US history . The deportation machine is now being handed to Trump whose administration is aggressively delivering on his fascist and white supremacist campaign pledges to slam the door on refugees and migrants . The spike in deportations has been coupled with the continuation of the countrys unrivaled prison industrial complex after Obama was elected he expanded the socalled Secure Communities program . The program has worsened the racial profiling and escalated the criminalization and deportation of undocumented people into the United States . In 2009 that number ballooned to 88 counties across the U.S. Advocates have decried the division of undocumented immigrants into the good and good into the country into the bad and deported people into good into good people into bad and illegal immigrants into good communities . In 2014 the grassroots resistance led by grassroots resistance to Obama announced he announced that he would not be targeted by Obama's immigration policies that he announced he would no longer be targeting illegal immigrants .

---  Fox host Sean Hannity will sit down with President Trump this Wednesday for his 69th interview with the president . Hannity's devotion to the president has taken an authoritarian turn in recent months as Trump has come under heavy legal and media scrutiny over whether his electoral victory was due in part to efforts by the Russian government to bolster his campaign . Media Matters reviewed Hannity8217s opening monologues on his Fox broadcast from midMay through the end of August analyzing the segments for a wide range of factors including his coverage of the Russia story . Hannity is priming his audience to applaud Trump if he fires the special counsel or to treat the investigation as illegitimate if it is allowed forward while preparing to undermine the president if the Justice Department takes action against his political foes . Hannity began promoting the conspiracy theory that a murdered Democratic staffer not Russian hackers had stolen Democratic emails . Seth Rich was murdered because he was a source for WikiLeaks is the most publicized symptom of the willingness to cross any line to undermine Russia story and was a popular conspiracy theory . The host made clear he was dredging up conspiracy theories and said he would do so with much fervent support of the host and his fervent effort to do so as he has repeatedly suggested he might do so . Hannity said it would clear it was true  Hannity's second most regular guest was Fox8217s Gregg Jarrett who appeared in 36 episodes of the program over the term of the study . Gregg Jarrett recently emerged as the leading Trump legal defender . Hannity criticized Mueller in 12 of the 61 monologues and criticized Mueller for purported 8220conflicts of interest . Hannity also called for Mueller to step down or step down for any member of the investigation team . Hannity called Mueller's investigation a 8220witch hunt and called for a special prosecutor to review Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server . Jarrett has falsely claimed that even if the president or his team colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election they wouldn8217t have broken any laws . Hannity frequently repeated the charge making it in 15 of the total 25 percent of the the study 25 percent . Hannity has also scrutinized the team highlighting some of the lawyers had made purported political donations to some of Mueller's team in 13 of the . Democrats in 13 instances of alleged conflicts of interest for any apparent hits on the investigation .

The primary budget surplus targets which have emerged are significantly lower than those that everyone anticipated would be incorporated into the agreement based upon the deal that was struck in broad strokes on July 13 in Brussels . The targets are now a deficit of 25 percent of GDP or 025 percent this year followed by a surplus of 05 percent in 2016 and 175 percent in 2017 to 35 percent in 2018 . The IMF staff acknowledges that if Greece does not get as dramatic as the IMF now acknowledges now a writed up on debt now acknowledges a dramatic writed down with all of the IMF staff of all the debt . The agreement is premised on the calling projections for economic growth in the next several years A shrinkage in GDP of 21 to 23 per cent this year and a return to 23 percent growth in 2017 . The numbers are highly unrealistic and potentially arguably arguably arguably fantastical as Joseph Stiglitz has pointed out this agreement is more likely to perpetuate the depression without end And I see no reason to believe  Greece really needs a massive writedown of debt, says LASCAR . IMF leadership has been very clear about the necessity of a massive write-own of Greek debt . IMF has taken a much softer line and has sent out signals that they would be prepared to accept something like an extension of maturities and a reduction in interest rate This is not something that is likely to resolve the debt sustainability problem for Greece . The deal is a precondition for Germanys participation in the bailout . The Greek public is going to have very little time to digest what has actually been agreed to and the politicians are going to be very few time to inaud PERIES . The liberalization of the energy market is really another component about energy liberalization What is that and how will that be interpreted and implemented? LASCASCAR says. Theres not going to kick in the Greek democracy is really a sort of stomach to be put in the stomach to Greek democracy. The Greek government is not likely to have any meaningful debate on this sort of important legislation. It is completely unrealistic to expect that within 48 hours people could digest the massive legislation which will reveal all of these key details and which will kick in in the kick-in-the-beating

---  Seven years of unprecedented European Central Bank stimulus have helped feed a 40 billioneuro boom in foreign buying of central European debt . Foreign holdings of Polish bonds are up over a third at 200 billion zloty while it topped 725 billion crowns in the Czech Republic last year over half its domestic debt 8220 . A near 40 percent rise in foreign holdings since 2014 is as likely to be down to a sovereign credit rating upgrade that got its debt promoted into the big bond indices as to the ECB's actions . The move is in fact already underway as regional growth and inflation tick up in line with the euro zone recovery . The Czech central bank raised rates twice last year and is expected to do as many as three this year . Romania has just delivered its first rate rise in a decade .

The final US government read on fourth quarter GDP on Wednesday will come hot on the heels of the Federal Reserve8217s first interest rate hike of the year In theory it should be reassuring The United States is a fairly closed economy and in the fourth quarter Donald Trump was dishing out tax cuts not threatening trade wars .

---  It is undeniable the final collapse triggers are upon us triggers alternative economists have been warning about since the initial implosion of 2008 . The mainstream spin machine is going into high speed the more negative data is exposed and absorbed into the markets . This is a common tactic by the establishment elite to string the public along with false hopes so that they do not prepare or take alternative measures while the system crumbles around their ears . The days of effective disinformation in terms of the financial system are coming to an end as investors and the general public begin to absorb the reality that the global economy is indeed witnessing a vast crisis scenario and acknowledges real numbers over fraudulent numbers . The lies of the lies will likely hear as the collapse accelerates as we come to zero hour and the lie of the lie will likely be likely to be magnated by the collapse will be legion . The same hypocrisy inherent in this is truly astounding to say the hypocrites inherent in the hypocrisy inherent to say it is truly remarkable to say that China is now being uttered by the same mainstream dirtbags who only claimed only months ago that the crisis is not really a crisis is being uttered in this way . The establishment will try to marginalize the collapse signals they can no longer hide as if such lies are of  The mere mention that the Fed might delay the end of near zero interest rates in September by a Federal Reserve stooge recently sent markets up 600 points after a weeklong bloodbath . The potential for any interest rate increase no mater how small also has wider implications for markets . The crash in global stocks which will undoubtedly continue over the next several months despite any delays on ZIRP by the Fed is a product of universal decay in fiscal infrastructure . China8217s crash portends our own far worse economic conditions that western markets have been crumbling along with western markets despite the assumptions of the mainstream . Globalist entities like the IMF argue that their current crisis is merely part of the 8220new normal8221 a future in which stagnant growth and reduced living standards is the way things are supposed to be I expect the Fed will use the same exact argument to support end of zero interest rate rates in the US claiming that the decline of American wealth and living standards are a natural part of new economic world order we are entering . One day soon the Fed the IMF will attempt to convince the American people that the erosion of the economy and the loss of world reserve status is actually a loss in value is a natural thing . In the meantime they will claim that the

MacLean leaked a text message that had been retroactively classified by the TSA . He was fired in April 2006 and has spent the last seven years trying to get his job back on his job . The Department of Justice wants to use MacLean8217s case to further limit what kinds of information can qualify for statutory whistleblowing protections . A restriction would gut the legal protections of the Whistleblower Protection Act and have a chilling effect on future acts of conscience . If heard by the Supremes even more information about an outofcontrol executive branch will disappear under the dark umbrella of 8220national security8221 . The case would represent the first federal whistleblower case of the post911 era . The Most Transparent Administration ever, Tom Engelhardt says. There are no established reporting requirements under those policies or other secret indicators and there are only three levels of governmental classification and other top secret indicators. By there are NONFORFORFOR and other indicators such as NOFORFORNFOR and Other indicators as there are no secret indicators . There are multiple secret indicators as well as top indicators and top indicators. No secret indicators or top indicators .  Robert MacLean was fired by the TSA in retaliation for a legally protected act of whistleblowing . The Department of Justice petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn the lower court's decision . MacLean is simply trying to get his old air marshal job back by proving he was wrongly fired for an act of whistleblower . The Obama administration has charged more whistleblowers 8212 under the Espionage Act than all past presidencies combined . The DOJ is seeking to bring the case via a petition is significant given the desperately low odds of success . It will be several months before we know whether the court will hear the case .

It has charged a number of them 8212 and has charged seven 8212 seven under the espionage Act than the Esp Espidencies than the State Department . In addition it recently pressured State Department whistleblower Stephen Kim into a lighter sentence for a lighter plea in return for return for a return for his return for all past past all past Espidency combined with the full force of the Esp. of classification and a coconspirator for a coconator for his case .

Palin said Alaska  Katie Couric asked Palin what newspapers and magazines she regularly read before she was tapped for this to stay informed and to understand the world .

With white nationalist fascists planning more rallies to come it8217s a foregone conclusion that the violence in Charlottesville will continue .

The other side including Antifa and Redneck Revolt offer a principled stand against fascism seeking to eliminate fascism .

White nationalists and fascist groups are stepping forward celebrating Trump8217s commitment to their cause . The stakes involved in this conflict cannot be understated. Antifa and Redneck Revolt will simply deteriorate into leftwing and rightwing groups duke out in the streets in the face of intensifying suppression of leftist groups .

Their decimation is already predetermined 8220 The left8221 in the US is a shadow of what it once was organizationally speaking with the decline of public intellectualism in higher education and the collapse of unionism . The left is far too fragmented and unorganized to come together in support of a mass violent insurrection that is capable of defeating or even withstanding a joint attack by farright militia groups random white supremacists running through the streets a la Charlottesville .

The wintry blast on the second day of spring was dubbed 8220four8217easter8221 by some media outlets because it struck after three previous storms this month . Those storms left nine dead and more than 2 million homes and businesses without power . Concern over further trade tariffs and a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve left stocks flat after a choppy session Wednesday as investors tried to balance out the effects of low inflation and higher trading costs on the global economy . US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday his agency has worked on US investment restrictions on China for President Donald Trump to consider as part of his decisions on intellectual property actions against Beijing . Trump is expected to decide whether to impose tariffs on some 60 billion worth of Chinese technology products and other technology goods to force changes to the US trade deficit in China to shrink a gaping US trade trade deficit .

---  Tesla Inc TSLAO will fall short of its 2500 per week target for production of the crucial Model 3 sedan when it reports its numbers this week according to a report by tech website Jalopnik citing an email from Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk to employees . China said late on Sunday it will slap an extra 15 percent tariff on ethanol imports from the United States part of its response to US duties on aluminum and steel imports . The tariffs effective Monday will neutralize cost savings from importing cheaper US ethanol versus domestic supply . Chinese buyers of US ethanol will have to cut imports because of higher tariffs but eventually will return to overseas market to meet government targets for using the fuel industry participants and analysts said on Monday . May ethanol futures 1ZEK8 fell 25 percent or about 4 cents to 144 per gallon the lowest since Feb 9 as trade resumed after the tariff announcement . Oil prices in Brazil are currently too high for high for exports to China but could be an option in future but analysts said that it is not clear where future imports will come from . Analysts said China will probably need to resume imports to meet the government target of 10 percent ethanol content in all gasoline nationwide by 2020 by 2020 . China's current ethanol mandate .

Seven countries in the region will host the most licensing rounds in history8221 said Pablo Medina vice president of energy consultancy Welligence . The embrace of foreign capital in Argentina Brazil and Ecuador also follows the rise of centrist or rightleaning governments . But they also face a risk that governments could shift back to resource nationalization or lose the political will to fully establish market reforms .

We love this well-spent the well-being of the continent. We know this well well-to-spill oil and we need to make sure it will spend it wisely, say Hourcard . We love it well
---  In 1970 the protest song 8220War8221 sung by Edwin Starr hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . The song written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong became somethingamp160of a sensation . Tom Engelhardt: In these years no goal of Washington 8212 not a single one 8212 has been accomplished by war . By its very nature war produces chaos but also creates chaos in other eras but also means influence or dominance for great powers . U.S. has like no other on the planet in these years unleashed its military again and again thousands of miles from its 8220homeland8221 in actions ranging from largescale invasions and occupations to smallscale raids and drone assassination strikes absolutely nothing has up roses . The region that Washington officials hoped to garrison and dominate forever has only become an 8220 arc of instability as soon as they began to come to as much instability as they begin to come as soon soon as an 8217 arc of 9/20 arc after 911 and that began to become less amenable to American power and ever less stable, writes Engelhardt . For Washington war has somehow decoupled from its once expected results of its once-doomed military to once-planned invasion of Central Asian border to north Africa  In 2016 not only has military action of just about any sort been decoupled from success but the unbelievably profitable system of weapons production woven into the fabric of the capital the political process and the country has also been detached from the results of war . The worse we do militarily that is the more frenetically and expensively we build . The more failed states the more widespread the terror groups the greater the need to arm ourselves and as the planet8217s leading arms dealer others . When the Soviet Union imploded and Washington dissolved in a riot of shock and triumphalism only one imperial force 8212 8220the sole superpower8221 had just ended . A quarter century later militarily speaking two other nations might be considered great powers . China is indeed building up its military and acting in more provocative ways in nearby seas . The Russians are obviously another matter and they alone at this moment seem to be making an imperial success of warfare 8212 translating that is war making into power prestige and dominance and dominance . In Syria and possibly also Ukraine think of that country as experiencing its version of America8217t for a year or two or three but don’t imagine that it will last . The Russian version of U.S. will inherit the US

---  The president and House speaker restated familiar positions in their dueling debt ceiling speeches but they took their points too far at times or made them without enough context . For the most part the two men stuck to the facts or offered their opinions . Obama was mostly correct when he said that raising the debt ceiling was something that every president has done since the 1950s . Obama recycled a wellworn but misleading Democratic talking point when he accused Republicans of favoring tax breaks for oil companies and owners of private jets at the expense of cuts for Medicare recipients . Boehner claimed that Obama was against any fundamental changes to Medicare or Social Security programs . The president is adamant that we cannot make fundamental entitlement changes to our entitlement programs . Boehner said Obama has proposed to bucket our bucketetet our entitlement program .

The president reportedly is seeking more revenue . Raising revenue that that would require a lot than the President is seeking the President’s added added added revenue that  Obama was open to raising the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67 in exchange for Republicans agreeing to raise taxes . Boehner said Obama wanted a blank check six months ago but that's not true Boehner also accused the president of wanting a . blank check today Boehner said the president demanded 400 billion more than they had originally agreed upon . The White House spokeswoman confirmed to us that those were the specific measures Obama has proposed . The House passed the Cut Cap and Balance Act with bipartisan support but it failed to clear the Senate last week . The Senate voted 5146 along party lines to table the House bill effectively killing it . Boehner's new plan would increase the debt ceiling by nearly 1 trillion 8212 enough to last the early part of 2012 . It would force another debt ceiling before the presidential election according to reports that it would also force another vote on raising the . presidential election before the 2012 vote on the debt .

---  The conservative group Crossroads GPS has launched a 7 million ad campaign targeting President Obama five Democratic senators and 10 representatives . The group is a 501c4 nonprofit and a spinoff of American Crossroads an organization formed with help from former President Bush adviser Karl Rove . Five of the spots attack Democratic Sens Bill Nelson and Claire McCaskill blaming them for skyrocketing debt and reckless spending . Crossroads announced that it would also run 10 ads targeting House members but they have not hit the airwaves yet . A few points in the Senate ads are misleading or require context . The ads also show the words Healthcare Takeover 1 Trillion but not the net effect of the law and as weve said many times the law expands Medicaid but also greatly expands business for private insurance companies by requiring individuals to have coverage . These five Democrats also voted in support of Obamas tax deal last December which extended the Bush tax cuts and created a oneyear payroll tax holiday that reduced workers Social Security taxes by 2 percent . The campaign is airing heavily Kantar Medias Campaign Media Analysis Group counts 5460 airings worth a little more than 3 million as of July 14 as a little over 3 million airings of the ads are airing heavily . The ad gives a misleading view of the  The ad in both a one minute and 30 second format is running on national cable outlets and local TV in Colorado Iowa North Carolina New Mexico Nevada and Virginia . The ad features a woman talking about how sometimes its hard to sleep when worrying about jobs . She says she used to back Obama because he spoke so beautifully but things have gone from bad to much worse . The woman in the ad says that Obama promised spending hundreds of billions on a stimulus would create more jobs but now all weve got is a lot more debt and more people out of work Instead of fixing health care my moms Medicare will be cut and our health insurance premiums went up . The ads also refer to the stimulus as the failed stimulus that is a matter of opinion The stimulus did create jobs and lower the unemployment rate despite what Crossroads also says in its national ad criticizing Obama . But the national ad also implies that the stimulus did not create jobs as Obama promised It did M. The ad implies that mom won't be getting as much as much Medicare as she used as much of those 8212 additional eyeglasses or 8212 extra benefits she might get from private insurance plans before the health care law before the law says the law actually stands it stood it stands it stands .

---  David Frayne in his new bookamp160 The Refusal of Work is an attempt to question the nature of work and transform it or abolish it or transform it . The forgotten struggle of the Left which Andre Gorz represents is for the right of workers to lead rich and interesting lives outside of work . Reducing the workday is the demand of a radical reduction of work is the radical program not the revolutionary core of time . The core demand is to abolish work as the organizing principle of society while individual self-development is not the end point of society . The political task of society is to redistribute work as a whole society but of justice . These savings are the savings of society as the whole of society, not the economic savings of economic rationality but of social justice . In other words, Gorz is explicit about this words not economics . The work of time is to share out savings of time following principles not to share economic savings but of fairness and the social savings of the entire society but to share them on a whole scale of society. These savings is so that redistribute them on the scale of a whole . The job of society and redistribute the work of society are so that it is so .

The enormity of the project demands a perspective beyond the hope that environmentalists recognize the history of labor8217s resistance to work .

These texts originated with the United States and appear to be supported by other parties to the TPP even though those governments were reluctant to agree to them in the TPP and will no longer be bound by that agreement . That suggests the TPP may become the new norm even though it has only been ratified in two of the 12 countries and that was done on the basis of US participation that no longer applies . Some of the most extreme measures have been dropped at least for now and much of the text is not agreed Nonetheless there is nothing to cheer about . There are no improvements on the inadequate protections for health environment privacy workers or economic development and there is no improvements to developing countries becoming even more vulnerable and dependent in an already unequal and unfair global economy . TISA would prohibit developing countries from adopting measures that countries like the U.S. used to facilitate its industrial development when it was an emerging country in the 19th century . The US had the opposite law its 1885 contract labour law prohibited the import of foreign workers in the 1880s contract labour laws .

Professor Carlo Panico suggests that overspending by governments wages got too high too much social safety net is not the cause of the crisis . He recently published a paper at the PERI institute called The Role of Institutional and Political Factors in the European Debt Crisis . Our guest suggests that the problem comes from the way the European Monetary Union is organized The European Monetary Unions organized in this way I mean we have 17 countries belonging to the226128148which have adopted the euro this new currency . We have just one monetary policy which is decided at the supranational level at the European level . The national government can use the funding coming from Europe from Europe to favor their own elections so to increase the expenditure in favor of their own election . And this increases finance by all the other elections of the euro area the euro Area see So you try to stabilize the interest rate at the EU level and then this cause an incentive for a national government to misbehave with respect to the European monetary policy . So you have this disparity which is unusual in other countries Normally you have the monetary authority and the fiscal authority they are the same national level But this  The European financial and political elite think its in their interest to drive these countries into crisis for some time, says PANICO . The European Central Bank is not playing the role of lender of last resort for the banking system after the breakdown of the Lehman Brothers .

The answer is get out of the eurozone because its never going to serve your national interests, says Panico .

He is also the founder and President of PEAR Pollin Energy and Retrofits an Amherst MAbased green energy company operating throughout the United States . Bob Pollin says the price of oil is spiking again just like it spiked last summer and again in 2008 right before the recession . The price spikes had to do with the role of speculation on the commodities futures market which has expanded by about 400 percent relative to ten years ago . Pollin: The price spike is based on a price spike based on whats going this news gets this dighowhow148148148 and then when the price goes up then the speculators hope to see prices keeping going up . And then the price is going up even more Then the spot market follows the spot price in the futures markets which pushes up the price . The Real News Network is now heading again towards 4 at the pump and then that feeds back in todays price that is heading back into todays prices . We are talking about the alternatives and why is the oil market so high and what are the alternatives? We are looking at the alternatives to all of this  Oil futures market is being pulled by the fact that we have this hyperspeculative oils futures market . President Obama seems to accept the logic that we need to produce more domestic oil and alternative energy sources which the Republicans dont say much of that from him . But on the whole he seems to kind of accept that the Republicans do not talk about the issue of speculation about position limits the whole financialization as you say . The impact of the speculative market far swamps what could actually happen as result of drilling in Alaska for building the pipeline . The effects of those things of course in any case are only going to occur over a matter of several years and meanwhile we dont see any significant supply and demand imbalances . Romney has already said this is one of his top five issues running against Obama that hes going to say that Obama wants the price of oil to be higher . But at the same time that we are raising gas emissions so that we also need to be much more efficient in terms of building out much more energy efficiency measures and investing in renewable energy . The rest of society pays in many other ways but not directly in how it affects the oil price of a carbon oil based economy that isnt taken into account because of the rest of the other ways .

---  Donald Trump is indisputably the greatest possibly in the history of the universe when it comes to yanking just about anybody8217s chain . Donald Trump has already won no matter what happens since he continues to be treated as if he were the only threering circus in town as if were in himself filled to the brim with clowns . The Imperial Presidency Exposed could be based on absurdity and unsettling clownishness all down to the zany crew of clowns who have pumped up and pumped up the news in the Oval Office . In early October 2016 I suggested that a segment of voters in the white heartland were willing to do so even if it collapsed on them even if the ceiling at the height of the . ceiling on them, hence hence in MAGA .

In November 2016 I thought that they would even be willing to . do so . And I suggested they were willing .  Donald Trump offers a chillingly exaggerated wildly fieryandfurious version of the very imperial American presidency we8217ve come to know over these last seven decades . The imperial presidency has long ridden herd on a nuclear apocalypse that killed millions on its journey to nowhere in Southeast Asia in the previous century . In its pursuit of its neverending 8220war8221 on terror has made war on so much else as well turning significant parts of the planet into zones of increasing chaos failed states fleeing populations and wholesale destruction . The battle against ISIS in Iraq and Syria has been termed the 8220most precise military 8212 campaign in history8221 The war on terror is but an eerily clownish version of all that has gone before, writes David Frum . He has in a sense ripped away the fa231ade of dignity from the imperial presidency and let us glimpse just what is truly imperial and imperious about it, Frum says .

---  The United States and South Korea could announce a trade deal next week that would cover exemption from US steel and aluminum tariffs and other trade issues . It was not immediately clear whether the deal would encompass a revamp of the 2012 USSouth Korea Free Trade Agreement known as KORUS which has been under negotiation for several months . The escalating tensions sent shivers through financial markets as investors foresaw dire consequences for the global economy if trade barriers start going up Trump is planning to impose the tariffs for what he says is misappropriation of US intellectual property . China urged the United States on Friday to 8220pull back from the brink as President Donald Trump8217s plans for tariffs on up to 60 billion in Chinese goods moved the world closer to a trade war . China showed readiness to retaliate by declaring plans to levy additional duties on additional duties to levy up 3 billion of US imports including fruit and wine in response to US import tariffs including steel and wine imports . China has always said it will not hold talks with the US within the framework of the Section 301 probe that was launched last year under Section 301 of the 1974 US Trade Act . Washington has not given any concrete action the US tariffs constitute a unilateral move that it rejects . Washington hasn't given any todo list to remedy  China has drawn a list of 128 US products that could be hit with tariffs if the two countries are unable to reach an agreement on trade issues . China is considering implementing measures in two stages first a 15 percent tariff on 120 products including steel pipes dried fruit and wine worth 977 million and later a 25% tariff on 199 billion of pork and recycled aluminum . China's retaliation against the US tariffs on steel and aluminum appeared restrained . Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China would not hold back in retaliating .

---  Chester Pennsylvania has one of the nation's highest homicide rates it has a far lower than average 8220 clearance rate . Chester has 30 homicides have been solved a rate less than half the national average . Chester is a hotbed for organized crime and drug trafficking in Philadelphia . In the 1980s when crack and heroin syndicates swept through black neighborhoods black parents and pastors were some of the first and loudestvoices to demand a war on drugs What they got was 8220broken windows8221 policing . The bitter irony is that it was this same complaint that helped spawn the aggressive policing tactics now under attack from Ferguson to New York City . In highminority communities like Chester the number of homicides in which the victim was white was just 45 percent . Chester once thrived on industry and factories including a Ford plant offered good jobs for black and white residents through the 1950s . Today the city's population has nearly half its post-war population with half its postwar population with nearly half of its population leaving the city in the middle class suburbs leaving the middle-class families leaving the suburbs . Chester now has a low clearance rate for crime and a high clearance rate of homicide in which victims are white . Chester's clearance rate is lower than the national national average.  Chester has made its own efforts to turn things around after a string of homicides left four people dead in just eight days in 2010 . The faster officers secure the scene notify homicide detectives and ID witnesses the more likely it is the killer will be brought to justice . The relationship between police and community is so strained that residents are often reluctant to come forward . Chester launched another crackdown on violence last May with its officers joining state and federal agencies to sweep the city for parole offenders . Chester Mayor John Linder moves deliberately like the socialsciences professor he once was as mayor . Linder is taking over as mayor to social services and rampinder to change a culture as well as a culture of changing a culture .

---  A US citizen is reputedly planning attacks against Americans abroad . The White House has for the last several months been considering whether or not to assassinate him by drone without trial or due process . The president is assured that the Justice Department tells him so And that that's justice enough in postConstitutional America . The answer is we don't know why the Obama administration leaked its plans in reference to this errant American abroad . It's unclear whether there could have been other undocumented killings of undocumented American citizens awaiting the same sort of revelations of some future Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning . The Obama administration admits to killing four Americans as part of the war on its war on terror is part of its own war on or war on war on terrorism . The first time we've seen such acts for the first time that we don’t know what it is The First Time. We’ll pause here a moment for you to pause here to contemplate whether the killings of the same kind of undocumented undocumented killings are awaiting the revelations of future Edward Manning or Edward Snowden . Such killings should be the same type of killings of some other undocumented American people in the U.S. and when we’re awaiting them after they’ve been killed. Such killings  There is nothing in the carefully worded distinctions made by the White House to preclude assassinations at home . The president claims there is no difference between an American citizen terrorist and a foreign terrorist . The broad openended criteria the president laid out for killing suspected terrorists exposes the postConstitutional stance our government has already prepared for All that8217s left to do is pull the trigger . The Fifth was meant by those who wrote it as a check on the ultimate in government excess the purposeful taking of citizens8217 lives today it increasingly seems an artifact of a quaint past as seemingly lost to history as the corded phone or manual typewriter .

The judge did not have 8220standing to sue and that the father did not decide that government officials were immune from lawsuits as part of their official duties but ultimately passed on getting involved in the US government to prevent it from killing a son but the judge did ultimately pass on a suit of its own .

---  The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy late Monday after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor . Texas private equity firm Lantern Capital agreed to buy the Company out of bankruptcy for 310 million setting the floor for other bidders in a courtsupervised auction scheduled for later this spring . Harvey Weinstein who cofounded the company with his brother Bob has been accused of sexual misconduct including rape by more than 70 women .

---  President Bush gave a false description of proposed legislation to expand the SCHIP program to provide health insurance for children in lowincome working families . He said it would result in covering children in families with incomes up to 83000 per year which isn't true . The Urban Institute estimated that 70 percent of children who would gain coverage are in families earning half that amount . Bush also misstated the intent of the program by claiming it was meant to help poor children when in fact Congress stated that it was intended to expand coverage beyond the poor and to cover millions of lowincome children who were well above the poverty line . Today congressional leaders agreed on compromise legislation that would call for the 35 billion increase of funding for SCHIP of 5 billion over five years . The full legislation will be available Monday and Bush has a threatened a veto of a veto . Bush is simply wrong to say that the legislation would cover those making 83000 a year to be eligible for a family of four . The president also says Congress8217 expansion is a step toward governmentrun health care for all of the children and families with private insurance are expected to shift to the government program . The bill contains no requirement for any such increase in funding that would cost an additional 35 or 50 billion with the larger upgrade .  The SCHIP plan is an incremental step toward the goal of governmentrun health care for every American It is true that the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the House and Senate bills will cause some who recently had private coverage to sign up for SCHIP or Medicaid coverage depending on how the state administers those programs . CBO Director Peter Orszag said he hasn't seen another policy proposal that would reach as great a level of the uninsured with as low of an effect on those who had private insurance . The House bill would extend coverage to a total of 75 million people 5 million uninsured while the Senate bill would reach 61 million 4 million of whom are uninsured according to CBO reports . The rest of those affected by the expansions would have private or other coverage . The president says movement of people from private to public insurance under these bills is unacceptable which is a matter of opinion . We feel this additional information is necessary to give a full picture of the bills8217 effects . We do know where the 425 million figure comes from According to John Sheils at the Lewin Group the secretary simply misspoke the secretary . The President will veto will 8212 is represented to offer 26 million insurance However 12 million of those already have private insurance and 900000 of them already qualify

He is the author of 8220 The Challenge of Affluence SelfControl and WellBeing in the U.S. and Britain Since 19508221 for 25 years has explored the cavernous gap between our economic and social reality and our ruling economic ideology . Neoclassical economics he says is a 8220justworld theory8221 one that posits that not only do good people get what they deserve but those who suffer deserve to suffer . He says this model is 8220a warrant for inflicting pain8221 If we continue down a path of mounting scarcities along with economic stagnation or decline this neoclassical model is ominous It could be used to justify repression in an effort to sustain a vision that does not correspond to the real world, he says . The other hand is the invisible hand the idea that the pursuit of individual selfinterest builds up for the good of the good society as a whole, he said . Offer suggests we examine how past societies coped successfully with scarcity with scarcity in the age of scarcity in an era of scarcity . Offer says that the Soviet Union had to use so much coercion undermined the credibility of communism as a model of reality  Offer argues that economists are not in a strong position to tell society what to do . The old norms of economics continue to inform our policy norms as if the cheating norm had never been introduced . The standard in modern society is that government allocates between 40 to 50 percent of output . The anomaly is not explained by economic theory, he said . The current economic model he said will be of little use to us in an age of ecological deterioration and growing scarcities . Offer argued that we cannot be certain that growth will continue If standards of living stagnate or decline he said we must consider other models for the economy . Offer has studied closely the economies of World War I amid this catastrophe he notes civilian economies adapted He holds up these war economies with their heavy rationing as a possible model for collective action in a contract economy in a contracting economy . He said we need to think about then these rationing societies provide quite a successful model . He argued that the war economies provide a model of collective action . The model will be 8220hanging together or falling apart, or failing to survive for a drop in living standards to what they were one or two generations ago would still permit a good quality of life would still allow for a . good quality to .
---  David Hobson a powerful subcommittee chairman says he couldn't understand why the Energy Department was so determined to build a multibillion dollar plant in South Carolina for transforming plutonium into fuel for US nuclear reactors . The plant was billed as a noble arms control initiative meant to dispose of the plutonium so it could not be used in weapons again . Hobson was troubled by billions in cost overruns a lack of demand for the reactor fuel and the existence of cheaper alternatives . He says he abandoned his effort to halt construction of the plant in the face of intense lobbying by the Department of Energy the Bush administration and fellow congressional Republicans . But the MOX plant has survived threats before thanks to the ardent support of a handful of powerful public officials in South South Carolina and their allies in Congress including some leading deficit hawks . The Palmetto State politicians in the past have proven adept at keeping MOX alive by making the prospect of canceling the project alive as painful as possible . The Obama administration wants to slash planned spending by half next year and maybe eliminate it in 2015 . The State has played an important role in keeping the plant from foundering but some doubt it will ever be finished But the project has survived a series of construction snafus and revisions to its goalst  South Carolina politicians already have a strong political motive to support the MOX project . But they and their allies in other states have also benefited from campaign donations by companies with a financial stake in the project . The region near Savannah River Site is a sea of prosperity in a rural corner of the state . The roughly 11,000 workers at the Site enjoy an average income more than double that of their neighbors who work elsewhere according to a May 2011 study by the University of South Carolina at Aiken .

John Breaux who left Congress in 2005 and Linda Ann Lingle the former top liaison to the Department of Energy Energy said she was trying to kill the project and was paid to promote the project last year . South Carolina officials said the company ramped up its own responsibility to promote its responsibility to the project after an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity . The MOX plant is now a joint venture of two European companies one based in France and the other in the Netherlands which now controls 70 percent of the project has been purchased by Chicago Bridge ampamp Iron NV NV8212 .

After the end of that story, the population of Cambodia took out the total of the population after the American bombs fell out of the area of Snolol where the bombs fell . The bombing raids continued for 14 months and there were only a few who were old enough to discover that few were alive enough to have been alive to have survived the bombing raids that were only to discover there were no more than a few .  CIA analysts in distant Virginia are using pilotless drones and satellite technology to order strikes against supposed terrorist headquarters across the border in Pakistan . Operation Breakfast seems to be repeating itself as in the 1960s in Cambodia these strikes are in actuality having a devastating destabilizing effect in Pakistan not just on the targeted communities but on public consciousness throughout the region . The fury over these attacks has even spread into Pakistan's military establishment which in a manner similar to Sihanouk in the 60s knows its limits in its tribal borderlands and is publicly uneasy about US air strikes which undermine the country's sovereignty . Even proAmerican Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has spoken out publicly against drone strikes which have already been increasing in Pakistan especially in regard to crossborder sentiment especially in reported and reported strikes which are reported to cause unacceptable civilian casualties .

---  Iraq is of course one of the world8217s great hydrocarbon preserves . According to oil giant BP it harbors proven proven oil reserves of 115 billion barrels . Oil reserves are more than any country except Saudi Arabia with 264 billion barrels and Iran with 138 billion . Iraq has been continually thwarted by war foreign intervention sanctions, internal disorder, corruption and plain old ineptitude . If all its reserves known and suspected were developed to their full potential Iraq could add as much as six to eight million barrels per day to international output postponing the inevitable arrival of peak oil and a contraction in global energy supplies .

The central bank raised its benchmark overnight lending rate three times last year to a range of 125 to 150 percent as joblessness fell and economic growth accelerated . The Fed is expected on Wednesday to raise rates by another 25 basis points on Wednesday and may signal more hikes are coming in response to tax cuts and government spending that could further stoke a robust US economy . Fed officials have speculated in recent weeks that the stimulus could drive more Americans into an already tight labor market and lift inflation to the central bank8217s 2 percent target or much above that level if the economy gets too hot . But analysts are split over whether the Fed which is wary of an early misstep under its new leadership will raise policy tightening expectations until more price pressures are clearly evident especially given outside risks to the economy such as a possible global trade war . Fed could leave its rate outlook unchanged until then to see how the economy absorbs the 18 trillion in stimulus expected from the Trump administration tax cuts . The blockbuster US jobs report for February could convince Powell Powell to carry on longer-term or carry on a rise in longer term or carry out a hike could carry on on longer than previously thought .
---  China announced plans to place a 25 percent tariff on certain US aircraft in a move expected to affect some older Boeing Co BAN narrowbody models . The impact remained uncertain because of a lack of detail in the announcement and the fact that not all airplane characteristics are published . The United States exported 15 billion of aircraft to China in 2016 ranking equally with agricultural products like soybeans as the biggest category of goods . Boeing shares fell as much as 6 percent after China hit back at US tariffs with the announcement of duties on key US imports including soybeans cars beef and chemicals as well as planes . The U.S. exported a total of 15 billion aircraft to the Chinese market in 2016 .

China has not yet delivered a bulk of orders from Chinese airlines that have not yet been delivered for the newer 737 MAX that are expected to be delivered  China responded to US President Donald Trump8217s plans to impose 50 billion in tariffs on its goods by announcing tariffs of equal value on US imports including a wide range of agricultural products . Goods produced in South America made the list including soy beef tobacco cotton and frozen orange juice . China held around 117 trillion of US Treasuries as of the end of January making it the largest of Americas foreign creditors and the No 2 overall owner of US government bonds after the Federal Reserve . Analysts warn that Latin America could not entirely replace US production with Latin America producing enough to compensate fully for US output and that may push China and the United States to settle the dispute . But officials signaled no interest for now in bringing their vast holdings of US Treasury portfolio of US debt to the fight . Any move by China to chop its Treasury portfolio could inflict significant harm on US finances and global investors driving bond yields higher and making it more costly to finance the federal government . China is holding back on taking aim at their largest American import government debt after the fight but analysts say it is more effective if they keep holding holding their Treasury holdings as leverage but if they sell their own Treasury holdings are more effective than selling their own government bonds . Prices on benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes slipped Wednesday

China accused the United States of 8220repeatedly abusing trade practices as Beijing braced on Thursday for an imminent announcement from US President Donald Trump slapping more tariffs on more Chinese imports .

Trade wars are 8220good8221 and 8220easy to win8221 said the Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing has already prepared to strike back with tariffs aimed at Trump's support base including levies targeting US agricultural exports . China needs to adopt a tougher deterrent against counterfeiting and IP theft and do away with joint venture and licensing requirements that can be used to mandate technology transfers to gain market access to gain access to market access .

---  Pablo Solon is the former UN ambassador for Bolivia who in that capacity successfully spearheaded resolutions for the human right to water and indigenous rights . Solon says the green economy its main goal is to make money out of the environmental crisis . He says the Paris agreement is going to move in the direction of the commodification of nature . The real danger that we have now here is that at the end we will have a Paris agreement that will not solve the issue of global burning but will create more carbon market mechanisms that probably will be defined in the next COP in Morocco . The only thing you have to do is buy very cheap carbon credits from Russia and say oh look I already did my commitment of emission reduction . So carbon credits is a way to cheat nature I think it has failed during these year Its going to be seven years. The only problem we have is the hot air from Russia . We have one problem We have the hot . air from . Russia says Russia had a commitment to reduce a certain amount of . emissions Now they have reduced more than the rules of Kyoto Protocol that can bring it into the market as carbon surplus that can be brought into the protocol . And other countries that have not fulfilled their obligation to reduce more than Kyoto Kyoto Kyoto Protocol .  Canada as you know has a relatively small population relative to the major emitters approximately 34 million people . In terms of its overall emissions its contributing I believe in the range of 1617 percent of global emissions Its population accounts for a little bit less than 05 of the human population at this time . Bolivia Bolivia has around 90 million tonnes of carbon dioxide coming from deforestation . Bolivia has a population thats even smaller than Canada and even though I think that Bolivia has to do a lot because the per capita emissions are high . Bolivia is pushing in the case of Bolivia we should push all around the world to do real cuts LASCARIS Now youve been internationally a champion of indigenous rights And I understand that in the last couple of days references to indigenous rights were removed from the draft COP21 accord . But the key issue is what is that will that going to change. It has to be what will that change the reality of indigenous peoples rights LAS CARIS: I think it would be very important not to have just a mention that maybe happens maybe not in some article no It must be something that you say okay When it comes to finance we are going to take into account indigenous rights . And Canada has recently come out in favor of that Germany and France .

---  The labor movement has seen some important8212and at times unexpected8212 victories this past year . The election held by athletes at Northwestern University in Illinois in April sent shockwaves throughout the sports world . The move was an affront to the longstanding argument for the acceptability of exploiting NCAA athletes . The National Labor Relations Board NLRB was refreshingly helpful passing down several rulings that made organizing easier and wagetheft harder . FedEx Ground drivers won the right to vote in Kansas City and Burger King employee Terrance Wise said he will fight for a union in the U.S. This year was the third year as a national movement of lowwage workers demanding a minimum wage and a union . The US Supreme Court ruled in favor of FedEx Ground workers in Connecticut and Kansas in early October after a federal appeals court sided with FedEx drivers . The NLRB is the one of the most mis-classified contractors in the United States in its third year of mis-classified drivers in New York City and its third of misclassifying workers in the US . The labor movements have seen some of the country's most flagrant flagrant misclassifiers in the past year as well as the first of its misclassification of workers in its long line of workers .  The National Labor Relations Board issued several decisions this year that have improved the lives of thousands of workers . The agency ruled that employees can use company email for union activity which gets rid of one of the many hurdles organizers and workers had to clear especially during union elections . The new rule includes a number of significant benefits for workers who are organizing including postponing employer litigation over union election issues until after the election takes place . Seattle is the first major US city to raise the bar for its lowestpaid workers to 15 an hour making Seattle the first city to pass such a wage making Seattle a significant win for a national movement that set 15 as a concrete goal in bringing working Americans out of poverty .

---  Our culture has an unhealthy fixation with the 8220 antihero8221 character that is commonly seen in television and movies someone who lacks conventional heroic qualities and occasionally commits heinous acts . The creation of antiheroes was in response to the cookiecutter way heroes were portrayed in typical 8220good guy vs bad guy8221 fashion . I believe these fictional characters get cheered because many people feel powerless . But instead of addressing this powerlessness internally or directing their anger towards corrupt social economic and political systems they would rather cheer for people who do things they consider to be rebellious . People wanted to identify with a person who doesn8217t care about anybody else It feels powerful and liberating to feel like you can do whatever you want to whomever you want without consequences . But our constant rooting for fictional people who commit harmful acts diminishes our capacity for empathy when it comes to reallife people diminishes the ability to empathize with people who hurt others . I find there8217m saying that watching horrible actions being committed by people we portray as heroes normalizes violent behavior normalizes violence normalizes the behavior of Donald Trump . I wish I could say that the violence at Donald Trump rallies surprises me but it doesn't surprise me but I believe this is why he would be entertaining  Jessica Jones the protagonist of the Netflix television series with the same name is an example of a flawed hero who doesn8217t fall under the frivolously callous category . Jessica Jones is a good person who doesn't bask in having to commit violence and doesn't enjoy being called a goodytwoshoes . The more images we see of protagonists acting like kindhearted yet complex individuals the more likely we will accept these types of people as heroes in reallife . In Breaking Bad a television program about a chemistry teacher who becomes a drug kingpin the protagonist's wife Skyler White was on the receiving end of so much vitriol from the show's fans because she was getting in the way of watching antihero Walter White continually seize power . I believe this is indicative of our society8217s diminished capacity for empathy. The only people who are perceived as villains are the ones who are trying to stop the destructive behavior from continuing to continue to take the actions of the protagonist . The continued escalation of cheering on toxic behavior has made it that we view them as strong as strong because of the way people speak about victims is reminiscent with the way we take the abuse we take it about Skyler and take the toxic behavior . We view victims as strong while we view bullies as
---  Journalists and scholars familiar with rise of contemporary rightwing populist political parties and social movements in Europe however recognize that xenophobic antiimmigrant and racist rhetoric can lead to acts of violence . So I wrote a survey of the scholarship as a book chapter titled 8220 Heroes Know Which Villains to Kill How Coded Rhetoric Incites Scripted Violence8221 In it I summarized the consensus that rightwing rhetoric is a liberal myth . The progressive press has done a better job of pointing out this ugly potential . Trump should be held accountable on a moral basis by the media for his using the tools of fear such as demonization and scapegoating that put real people at risk for attacks . Freedom of speech is not the issue A free and open debate is a necessity for democracy Trump therefore is not legally culpable for any acts of Violence against his named scapegoats .

The resemblance according to Lynch is explained in the famous quote attributed to Italy8217s fascist dictator during World War II Benito Mussolini . Yet long before the appearance of totalitarianism in the modern era the United States saw mass movements that used force to subjugate or purge the degraded and demonized . The lightning speed of the right's rise can be explained by the simultaneous existence of all five factors in the current rightward swing . The Republican voter base is long enough to suggest that the closet of fascism and neofascism now suggest that anti-of-of fascism canamorphosize into fascistic totalitarian forms . Authoritarian nativism is not a European import to the import to xenophobic nativism in the U.S. Authoritarianism is not confined to Europe in the European Union but the import of xenophobia is a European xenophobic xenophobia to the American rightward . The author says that xenophobia has become a special target to appeal to the Christian Right to Christian Authoritarian Authoritarian to Christian Right . Authoritarism is a target to Christian

He had in many ways seen the shape of things to come for what he never hesitated to call 8220the American empire . The term 8216blowback8217 is a term of tradecraft a meaning even the CIA never imagined for it . America's official century of being top dog 19452045 will have come to an end its time may in fact be running out right now . We are likely to look ever more like a giant version of England at the end of its imperial run as we come face to face with our aging infrastructure declining international clout and sagging economy8221 . And if 8220unintended consequences8221 isn8217t a supremely appropriate title under which to write the misbegotten history of the years that followed 911 in the era of the selfproclaimed superpower will be coming to a halt .

---  The future may prove far more recalcitrant than the prophets of an American energy cornucopia imagine imagine . To reach their ambitious targets energy firms will have to overcome severe geological and environmental barriers 8212 and recent developments suggest that they are going to have a tough time doing so . The apocalyptic poster child for these unconventional drilling initiatives already played out in 2010 with BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster in Gulf of Mexico and the failure to commence drilling in the Arctic as a result of this summer's costly failure to start drilling in 45-billion-dollar Alaskan oil project . The future will be more frequent and more frequent mishaps and setbacks are more frequent than serious mishaps in conventional drilling operations, says Michael T Klare Tom Engelhardt . To produce energy companies have to drill in extreme weather or operate under 8212 or use extreme temperatures or extreme pressures or some combination of all of these risks are guaranteed to be more likely to be their accidents than some of these mishaps. The most notable example of this type of drilling was Shell Oil is the most notable failure of this sort of drilling. In each accident is the result of these types of mishaps more frequent. It will be their more frequent accidents than serious failures than serious consequences in conventional drills.  Droughts are expected to intensify in many regions putting the fracking boom very much into question . More fracking in turn means more water consumption which means more demand for less water . The drought is expected to continue to impact the arrival of energy8217s next golden age in North America . The Canadian tar sands are also likely to be a major obstacle to energy development in the U.S. and Europe . Mitt Romney has vowed to give it his approval on his first day in office in the first day of his first term in office if he wins the White House post-election . Romney is however expected to grant approval to a less aquifer-threatening route to the new aquifer route Mitt Romney's proposed tar sands route to make the call for the president to cross an international boundary the president gets to make it cross the international boundary . The president is also expected to call on Mitt Romney postelection to grant it his first call to approve the proposed pipeline in Canada in his office in his first year of office in office . The Keystone XL pipeline is expected however however . The pipeline is already already in place and it will be completed across the United States in the next year of its construction in the early stages of the first phase of the Obama administration .

We look at two ads that attack Butler and find both to be misleading . We also lay out the facts behind a radio ad by a liberal group attacking Gablemen . We leave it to readers to judge whether or not those facts add up to a political scandal as the ad claims . We conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the conviction of Reuben Mitchell who raped an 11-year-old girl with learning disabilities was a result of Butler's legal finagling or maybe a decision he made since he became a judge and used that freedom to commit more crimes 8211 is not true . Butler was appointed by a Democratic governor while GableMan was picked by a Republican . We can conclude that the eventual release of Mitchell stayed in prison until he was paroled in 1992 in 1995 he was convicted twice a . Butler had nothing to do with Mitchell's eventual release .

In September a number of unionized employees at Georgia Pacific plant posed for a photo in front of their union hall with a Democratic state Senate candidate Arnie Roblan with the backdrop the Kochs do not support . Unionized workers in the photo were worried that they might be fired from their jobs if the image got out on the Internet because in the backdrop of the photo the plant could be seen the Kochbacked state candidates were Republicans .

---  Neoliberal ideology destruction of Indian farming to be welcomedamp160 A fellow at the Adam Smith Institute ASI in London Tim Worstall recently argued on the Forbes website that India8217s farmers should be allowed to go bust because that is how economic development works . Worstall argues that the future of our food is being decided by unregulated global markets financial speculators and global monopolies . The result has been food surplus and food deficit areas of which the latter have become dependent on agricultural imports and stringsattached aid . Food deficits in the Global South mirror food surpluses in the North and food security is undermined by global trade agreements like NAFTA and NAFTA . The outcome has been similar the devastation of traditional indigenous agriculture for the benefit of transnational agribusiness and the undermining of both regional and global food security . We should consider the massive Aististist system of agriculture by Worstall advocated by the U.S. We are seeing what we are seeing in India in India are seeing the massive heistist A massive Aismist Aismism in India is exactly what we should consider in India . We need to look at the massive agricultural system of the US and the massive agroecologicalregenerative agriculture that once applied can and often match productivity  Tim Worstall8217s piece criticises notion that agriculture is being deliberately run down in order to shift the rural population to cities to work in industry and services . Worstall criticises the notion of agriculture being run down and says the whole point is to have labour moving into these sectors . The neoliberal agenda is not about giving farmers jobs or giving them better income It is simply about taking over their land for the superrich to build industrial parks and turn Indian agriculture into a US model of agriculture . Despite productivity lagging in India it is no excuse for supplanting it with a corporate model that will be dominated by foreign agribusiness. Small farms are more productive per unit land area than largescale industrial farms. Despite the commonlyheld perception they tend to outperform large industrial farms . The number of jobs created in India between 2005 and 2010 was created in 2010 was 27 million and 27 million years of the high GDP to GDP to boost exports or boost exports . The UK could eventually be lost to the five large corporations that are just five to five years of automation to the high-tech farming. It is worth considering that the loans provided to the large corporations are worth just to the low input farming strategies are more suitable for lower income countries.

---  The name of Washington DC8217s football team the Redskins is under fire . Jeremiah Goulka explains why Republicans wear a set of blinders crafted and actively maintained by the party's media priesthood . Republicans suffer from mental roadblocks shared by American whites more generally including a thin often mythbased 8220knowledge8221 about Native Americans . Republicans have a convenient belief that when it comes to racism it is all about intent and intent . A study8230 confirmed that the name of the Washington Redskins is only offensive if you take any amount of time whatsoever to think about its actual meaning8221 . A big reason why conservatives don8217t like change is the people who push for it and they publicly wonder what's keeping Republicans from thinking about it . The American Psychological Institute says that such stereotypes promoting negative stereotypes promote negative stereotypes and create a manufactured controversy creating the feared outrage. There8220racecard8221 creating a manufactured outrage creating a false controversy. There are those unwashed people who get off on on offended for other people . There are people fabricating outrage fabricating the fear of the feared controversy and creating the fear that the American Psychological Association. There is the obsession with identity and victimization of victimization. There were liberals foaming at the mouth about  There are at least three mental roadblocks in the way of Republicans coming to terms with the impact of 8220Redskins8221 not to speak of racism itself . Unlike the blinders these roadblocks are shared by white Americans across the political spectrum . Roadblock 1 Naming Practices are common and they have been around a long time the Redskins team name dates to the early 1930s. Roadblock 2 A MythBased 8220Education8221 It8217s easy to say that a name honors a culture when you don8217t know anything about that culture What are we taught in school? We were taught as children that 8220we8221 were the Pilgrims the stars of the story and 8220they8221 the Indians were the nice supporting cast who helped us get through a rough winter so that we could do our beautiful colonial thing. Later on I can recall a segment in social studies class on the Trail of Tears and I can remember some talk of treaties and reservations but that was about it for my education. I came away with the impression that the land the colonists found was empty and not just the sophisticated in what was the sophisticated empty and empty and didn’t talk about the Indian Wars’s battle of Little Bighorn
---  Tom Engelhardt: Torture as a word except in documents or in the mouths of other people has generally suffered a similar fate in our news world . The Bush administration used what in the Middle Ages used to be known bluntly as 8220the water torture82218212 We call it 8220 the water torture and we know mass murder when we see it . The phrase was of course meant to be lawevading since torture is a crime not just in international law but in this country . The fact is that if you can't call something what it is you have a tough time facing what you've done no less prosecuting crimes committed not quite in its name . Andrew Bacevich has a way of hacking through the verbiage of our world always heading for reality and bringing reality and naming practices back into sync with our naming practices . Tom Engelhard: We need to drive a stake through the heart of Luce's pernicious creation lest it come to life This promises to take some doing back to the days when Luce. This promises back to Luce’s creation of the TimeLife publisher his creation of 8220The American Century. It's time for Luce to push back back into the past by adding In What8217s Been Left  Richard Cohen may be right in declaring the American Century over the American people but the U.S. political class8212 still remain in its thrall . The persistence of this selfcongratulatory account deprives Americans of selfawareness hindering our efforts to navigate the treacherous waters in which the country finds itself at present . To give them their due is necessarily to render the standard account of the American century untenable . Here are several examples each one familiar even if its implications for the problems we face today are studiously ignored . The United States invented the bomb and employed it as a weapon of war The US led the way in defining nuclearstrike capacity as the benchmark of power in the postwar world . The US still maintains an enormous nuclear arsenal at the ready and adamantly refuses to commit itself to firstuse itself to commit firstuse policy . The U.K. has invited those other nations to Iran Extending his hand to Tehran as the United States invited those those those who have invited those who govern the Islamic republic to Tehran to hand to their fists to their fist fists . The line connecting these various developments may not be a straight one given the many twists and turns along the way but the dots do connect . The dots do not be the straight one .
---  Apple Inc said on Thursday that it will not hold a bidding process when it chooses the site for a planned new US campus marking a stark difference from the public contest that Amazoncom Inc has held for its second headquarters . Apple announced plans for a new campus on Wednesday along with a 5year 30 billion US spending plan that will generate 20000 jobs and an expected payment of 38 billion in taxes on its foreign profits . Amazon narrowed its list of applicants to 20 cities including Canada8217s Toronto and smaller cities such as Raleigh North Carolina and Columbus Ohio . Yahoo Japan Corp said on Friday it would buy a minority stake in a Tokyobased cryptocurrency exchange becoming the latest major Japanese financial services provider to shrug off security concerns and join the digital money industry . China has laid out national guidelines for testing selfdriving cars as it looks to keep pace with the United States in a global race to develop autonomous vehicles the China Daily newspaper reported on Friday citing the country 8217s industry ministry . The rules lay out requirements that vehicles must first be tested in nonpublic zones that road tests can only be on designated streets and that a qualified person must always sit in the driver position ready to take over control of the driver8217 car . China is making a major push into autonomous smart vehicles  Bitcoin rose as much as 17 percent at one point in midmorning European trading on Thursday . By 1250 GMT it was up 11 percent at 7705 its highest level since March 29 . Other cryptocurrencies like Etherium MVETH and Ripple MVXRP also rose sharply gaining more than 10 percent . After rocketing to almost 20000 in December bitcoin8217s price has fallen this year on the back of worries about a regulatory clampdown and concerns it is a speculative bubble that is now deflating . But a decision in the most important of three antitrust cases against Google this one aimed at loosening its stranglehold over Androidpowered smartphones is likely to show just how difficult it is even for a committed trustbuster like Vestager to dent the power of the US giants . The final ruling expected within the next few months will likely involve a multibilliondollar fine and an end to clauses in licensing agreements that stop smartphone vendors from promoting alternatives to apps such as Google Search and Maps people familiar with the European Commission8217 say . Google has still the option of going all out with its own Pixel phones if new Android phones if they refuse to store Google Search or the Google Play app store store store . The case holds lessons for regulators in Europe and elsewhere
---  Ahmed Mohamed was arrested for bringing a homemade clock to his school in Irving Texas . School officials reported the clock as a hoax bomb and called the local police . Five police officers handcuffed Ahmed Mohamed and handcuffed him and he was taken to a juvenile detention center where he was fingerprinted and interrogated before being released to his parents . Ahmed continued to serve out a threeday suspension from school for the creation of a socalled hoax bomb . Ahmed was suspended from school and detained and handcuffed by police officers on Monday after school officials accused him of making a fake bomb . MIT and Harvard Offered Ahmed tours of their Astrophysics facilities at MIT . Ahmed said he initially was scared that nobody was going to care about his arrest because he is Muslim and described a previous instance when he was singled out by his middle school vice principal who called him names and threatened to follow him until he graduated . Ahmed will transfer schools Citing Previous Prejudice from school officials Citing previous prejudice from school officials for previous instances of being singled out because he would not be returning to the school . Fox contributor and National Review Online editor Jonah Goldberg argued that public attention would be different if Ahmed had been wearing a Confederate flag tshirt when Ahmed had brought in the same clock .  National Review Online declared Ahmeds controversial arrest to be a phony case of Islamophobia and attacked President Obama and other public figures for expressing support for Ahmed calling their actions cheap moral preening and arguing that the story only received attention because it can be used to further a story about racism in the U.S. The bottom line characterizes the United States as a racist and bigoted country Characterize the United . The Federalist Editor IStandWithAhmed Is About Pretend Islamaphobia argued that public support was selective concern trolling to create the perception that discrimination against Muslims is a pervasive problem in American life . Townhall Columnist Jim Hanson claimed the school was being unfairly slurred as Islamophobic and placed the blame on the 14yearold Ahmed for bringing something to school that causes questions to be asked and on nanny state zero tolerance policies . Hanson compared Ahmeds clock to pictures of an Iranianmade improvised explosive device IED trigger calling it a dead ringer for triggers used on homemade homemade bombs the author saw in Iraq . The White House invited Mohamed to the White House to the Daily Mail on The Rush Limbaugh Show 91715.com Editor at Large John Nolte argued that the public attention given to the role of race in Ahmeds case was the work
---  The US Supreme Court has issued only 18 rulings in cases already argued this term lagging behind its normal pace . Supreme Court experts expect the justices to issue a largerthannormal number of 54 rulings in the coming months . With five conservatives and four liberals the court is ideologically divided meaning common ground may be difficult to find President Donald Trump8217s appointee Neil Gorsuch who marks his first anniversary as a justice on Tuesday restored the court's conservative majority after it was shorthanded and evenly split ideologically for 14 months . Experts expect there are going to be fewer unanimous decisions and more division8221 said Nicole Saharsky a lawyer who often has argued cases before the Supreme Court . The court usually takes less time in issuing a ruling when the justices are unanimous It has issued 11 unanimous rulings and seven with dissenting votes including three that were 54 . The slow pace of rulings may be the result of scheduling said Kannonannon Shanmugamamam Kannonamam Lawyer Kannon Lawyer John Elwood . There was no dissent when the court rejected a bid to intervene in Pennsylvania electoral boundaries in February when it rejected another electoral boundaries fight in the case in February. The court also rejected another bid to end a program that protects illegal immigrants brought into the United States  Interim data at 1300 GMT showed voter turnout at 5364 percent a touch higher than the 5359 percent in the second round in 2002 under a different election system when final turnout reached 735 percent . Some pollsters said voter turnout above 70 percent could signal that the opposition was mobilising supporters efficiently and might even deprive Fidesz of its parliamentary majority . Orban has farright admirers across Europe who like his tough line on migrants and a landslide win would show that his singleissue campaign arguing that migration poses a security threat had paid off . A strong win for Orban would embolden him to put more muscle into a Central European alliance against the European Union8217s migration policies Orban Hungary8217's migration policies or oppose deeper integration of the bloc . A close victory could embolden other rightwing nationalists in Central Europe in Poland and in neighbouring Austria and expose cracks in the 28nation EU and expose the cracks in EU . The antiimmigrant campaign has gone down well with many the roughly two million voters of Fidesidesz voters of Orban and many Hungarians who have left Hungary for years of unemployment and some of Hungary’s debt and putting its economy on a growth track . The EU has struggled to respond as Orban

---  Hedge fund investor Carl Icahn and another major owner of Xerox Corp stock Darwin Deason are pushing the digital print technology provider to explore strategic alternatives including a sale . The Trump administration this week will unveil a list of advanced technology Chinese imports targeted for US tariffs to punish Beijing over technology transfer policies . The tariffs are aimed at forcing changes to Chinese government policies that USTR says results in the transfer of US intellectual property to Chinese companies . China has denied that its laws require technology transfers and has threatened to retaliate against any US tariffs with trade sanctions of its own with potential targets such as US soybeans aircraft or heavy equipment . On Sunday Beijing slapped extra tariffs of up to 25 percent on 128 US products including frozen pork as well as wine and certain fruits and nuts in response to steep US tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel announced last month by the Trump administration . Fears have arisen that the two countries will spiral into a trade war that will crush global growth . The White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said last week that the tariffs would focus on Chinese industries benefiting from the Made in China 2025 plan which aims to replace advanced technology imports with domestic products .

Some current and former members of Trump8217s team are under investigation for alleged collusion with Russia in the runup to the inauguration . The Republican president last September ordered rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program . Under DACA hundreds of thousands of young adults dubbed Dreamers who were brought into the U.S. illegally as children have been shielded from deportation and given work permits . Trump has been fuming over the refusal of lawmakers to fully fund a 25 billion wall he wants to build on the USMexican border . Congress failed to meet that deadline but courts have ruled that the program can remain in place for now but has ruled that Trump acted improperly . Trump blamed Democrats for the status of the DACA program for the failure to replace it . The White House did not respond to comment on Trump's tweets for comment on a new immigration legislation on Monday . It was unclear whether in any new legislation would support for new safeguards for people protected by the program would be included in new legislation . The wall became a bargaining chip in DACA replacement legislation
---  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he was suspending a new agreement with the UN refugee agency to relocate thousands of African migrants as rightwing pressure mounted on him to scrap the deal . The agreement would relocate about 16250 of about 37000 African migrants most of them from Eritrea and Sudanese . Most of them would be relocated to Western nations while others would be allowed to stay in Israel . Israel has been under pressure from its nationalist voter base to expel the migrants . Some Israelis accused Netanyahu of caving to leftwing pressure and betraying the residents of south Tel Aviv a poor part of the city which has attracted the largest migrant community changing its ethnic makeup and enraging some of its inhabitants who want the migrants out . The fourterm prime minister faces one of the greatest challenges to his career yet he is under police investigation in three different corruption cases Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing .

The report did not refer to the comments by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in an interview published on Monday by US magazine The Atlantic which are the latest public sign that ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel may be growing closer . Increased tension between Tehran and Riyadh has fueled speculation that shared interests may push Saudi and Israel to work together against what they regard as a common Iranian threat . Saudi Arabia has maintained for years that normalizing relations hinges on an Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war territory Palestinians seek for a future state . IsraeliPalestinian peace talks have been frozen since 2014 have been suspended since 2014 .

---  US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he wanted to 8220get out8221 of Syria and promised decisions soon clashing with top advisors who spoke almost simultaneously about the hard work needed to defeat Islamic State . The remarks demonstrated how Trump appears increasingly willing to publicly push back against his top military advisors and those tied to the fight against the militant group . US Army General Joseph Votel who oversees US forces in the Middle East as the head of Central Command estimated that more than 90 percent of the group's territory had been taken back from the militants by USbacked forces by US forces .

Mexico has stepped up efforts to process dwindling  Mexican officials stepped up efforts on Tuesday to register a dwindling group of hundreds of largely Central American migrants who are moving through Mexico toward the United States . Mexican officials said on Monday the migrants in the caravan are undergoing an 8220administrative procedure8221 a process that officials said would determine whether they had the right to stay in Mexico or would be returned to their countries of origin . Hundreds of men women and children many of them from Honduras were stuck on Tuesday in the town of Matias Romero in the poor southern Mexican state of Oaxaca awaiting clarification of their legal status after officials began registering them . The group convened at the southern border town of Tapachula on March 25th reaching a peak of around 1500 people but by Tuesday the number was down to around 1100 according to Pueblo Sin Fronteras spokeswoman Gina Garibo . Many had broken off from the group eager to move on more quickly she said . The Mexican government says such caravans which travel by road rail rail and on foot have been organized every year since 2010 but the number of migrants had already been sent back to their home countries .

Lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe are demanding to know more about the company8217s privacy practices after a whistleblower said Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target US and British voters in closerun elections . Facebook shares closed down 49 percent on Tuesday and have fallen almost 18 percent since March 16 when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to a political consultancy which was hired by Donald Trump8217's 2016 presidential campaign . The company said it would instead send one of his deputies suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject . The Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing on Monday that it had opened an investigation into the company which it generally only does in cases of great public interest citing media reports that raise concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook .

---  Ray McGovern is a retired CIA officer McGovern was employed under seven US presidents for over 27 years presenting the morning intelligence briefings at the White House under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush . McGovern now works for Tell the Word a ministry of the innercityWashington Church of the Saviour . Paul Jay in Baltimore joins us to discuss Obama's nominations for the new secretary of defense and director of the CIA Chuck Hagel at defense and John Brennan for the CIA . Ray says Hagel has not been sufficiently passionately attached to Israel and Hagel is no chickenhawk . Hagel volunteered to go to Vietnam at the worst of the fighting wounded twice and has been very upfront about his reluctance or anyones reluctance to send US troops into battle for no good reason . The problem really is that these folks226128148theyre called the neocons 226128148these folks who have real difficulty distinguishing between the objective aims or the strategic aims of Israel on the one hand and the strategic needs of the United States on the other those are the people that think that Hagel might decide contrary to even what the president has said in terms of marching in lockstep with Israel that he might say . Paul Hagel may decide that contrary to what he has said George Bush said he didnt want  President Obama stood by the appointment of Hagel as head of the CIA . Hagel opposed the Iraq War not because he opposed projecting US power all over the world he just thought it was a stupid war . Obama realizes now four years later that Afghanistan is a fools errand and he needs support in the Senate to contend with the backsniping that is already occurring about losing Afghanistan . Obama will be helped by Hagel in sort of delimiting the defense budget which is going out of all proportion to the threats that Americans face JAY I think its a rational its a good thing that Hagels there because of the retrenchment of the problems here in this country . John Brennan pretends to know Arabic He can say Abdulmutallab just really good. But when you look at Brennan going to the CIA does it not mean sort of an expansion of this drone assassination program MCGOVERN Sure Now Paul just one little footnote about Hagel Hagel has served on the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board That is key He knows intelligence back and forth And he knows very well that in November194amp1602007 the entire intelligence community pronounced itself unanimously and with great confidence that Iran had stopped building a nuclear weapon at the end of 2003 .

---  AntiAmericanism is a potent weapon in the Bush plutocrats8217 disinformation armoury . Bush regime uses it to deceive the United States people while enriching its corporate buddies Spreading fear anxiety and hatred under the pretext of fighting terrorism . In Central America thousands of communities have been victims of terrorist aggression by the US government or its open support for genocidal militarydominated regimes in the region . In those places a more authentic voice of the U.S. people has been taken to heart . This truth counteracts the mindless racism encouraged by the neocons8217 regime . US citizens shared an authentically American vision that embraces as equals and as teachers the diverse peoples of all the Americas . As Bolivia tries to remake itself and the peoples of Venezuela and Colombia gear up to resist yet more White House sponsored terrorism1 now may be a good time to remember some United States citizens who had a very different vision from that of their government in Central American countries before and after Ben Linder . US nuns murdered in El Salvador and the murders of four women were followed by the assassination of the assassinated assassination in 1980 of El Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Oscar Romero and Archbishop Oscar Kirkpatrick . The full facts took years to emerge from an unrepentinian bloodthirsty Argentinian  Jesuit priest James Carney, a World War Two combat veteran was forcibly disappeared by the Honduran military in September 1983 . Remains exhumed at a former USContra military base in January this year may have been those of the missing priest . The discovery came after many years of efforts to find out how he died from the US authorities . Carney worked for over 20 years in northern Honduras and had taken Honduran nationality . He was expelled for his outspoken support for the rural poor in 1979 . Carney was especially incensed at CIA intervention in the internal elections of the most successful ever agricultural cooperative in Honduras Las Isletas subsequently sold to Standard Fruit company . In Nicaragua he met a group of other Honduran exiles determined to return home and start a campaign of armed resistance to the military presence in their country of the Nicaraguan Contra backed by the U.S. Carney felt he had no choice but to accompany them as their chaplain Twenty years ago he resigned from the Jesuit order and went back to the country he loved carrying his Bible in his pack The armed group crossed into Honduras reaching the remote Patuca district in Olancho . Of its 93 members over 70 were killed and then the small guerilla column was located Following desertions the small
---  The United States France and Britain launched 105 missiles overnight in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Syria a week ago . Western powers said on Saturday their missile attacks struck at the heart of Syria8217s chemical weapons program but the restrained assault appeared unlikely to shift the course of the 7-year-old civil war . Washington described its targets as a center near Damascus for the research development production and testing of chemical and biological weapons a chemical weapons storage site near the city of Homs and another site near Homs that stored chemical weapons equipment and housed a command post . The Western countries said the strikes were aimed at preventing more Syrian chemical weapons attacks after a suspected . poison gas . attack in Douma on April 7 killed up to 75 people . Inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPC were due to visit later to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack on Saturday to . inspect the suspected . site of Douma . The strikes had significantly crippled Syria 8217s ability to produce such weapons agents at one of the targets . The Pentagon said there had been chemical weapons agents and that the strikes had . been successful and targeted8221 McKenzie said there were no immediate reports of casualties . Russia had promised to respond to any attack on its ally but the Pentagon said no Russian air  Western countries have all said for seven years that Assad8217s must leave power they held back in the past from striking his government lacking a wider strategy to defeat him . The combined US British and French assault involved more missiles but appears to have struck more limited targets than a similar strike Trump ordered a year ago in retaliation for an earlier suspected chemical weapons attack . That strike had effectively no impact on the war . Syria agreed in 2013 to give up its chemical weapons after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Douma . The United Nations Security Council failed to adopted a Russiandrafted resolution on Saturday that would have condemned the aggression against the Syrian Arab Republic by the US and its allies in violation of international law and the UN Charter . Eight countries voted against the draft while four abstained A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia China France Britain or the United States to pass . Britain said the strike was not about intervening in a civil war or trying to topple the Syrian government but the mission had been a success she said in a statement made at Chequers minutes after US President Donald Trump announced the Western missile attack on Syria was legal and legal . British PM May said the strikes had been just a legal change from the White House
---  Pham To told me that the planes began their bombing runs in 1965 and that periodic artillery shelling started about the same time . Nobody will ever know just how many civilians were killed in the years after that 8220The number is uncountable8221 He said one spring day a few years ago in a village in the mountains of rural central Vietnam 8220So many people died8221 And it only got worse Chemical defoliants came next ravaging the land . The best estimate we have we have is that 73 million Vietnamese civilian casualties during the war for a total of 73 million civilian casualties . In all three wars in all three places civilian suffering is in fact the defining characteristic of modern war in general even if only rarely discussed in the halls of power or the mainstream media . In that way they managed to miss the one unfailing parallel between America8217s wars in the Vietnam War as PhamTo knew it in that way, says Ahmad Massoud of Pham Thang . He and Pham T. Massoud . In the end of the Iraq War, US troops were booted out of Iraq while the war in Afghanistan continues to this day as a dismally devolving stalemate now wracked by 8220 greenonblue8221 attacks on US forces  Afghans too would surely be able to relate to what Pham To and millions of Vietnamese war victims endured for more than 30 years . Afghanistan has with the rarest of exceptions been at war It all started with the 1979 Soviet invasion and Washington8217s support for some of the most extreme of the Islamic militants who opposed the Russian occupation of the country . The country which experienced an enormous brain drain of professionals has a total of 200 social workers and psychiatrists to aid all those armed and unarmed who suffered every sort of horror and trauma . In just the last seven years by comparison the US Veterans Administration has hired 7000 new mental health professionals to deal with Americans who have been psychologically scarred by war . In addition there are now an estimated 2 million Afghan orphans . For most Americans this type of unrelenting warrelated misery is unfathomable and deprivation is unathomable . Few have ever personally experienced anything like what their tax dollars have wrought in Southeast Asia the Middle East and Southwest Asia in the last halfcentury . Imagine for a moment what it might be like in American terms Imagine that the United States had experienced an occupation by a foreign military force. Imagine that you and literally millions like you have to flee your hometowns for squalid refugee camps or expanding slums ringing

---  On January 18 Wyoming officials announced a grizzly bear trophy hunt that could begin this fall . Wyoming officials said that a plan with details of the hunt including hunt areas and season lengths would be released for public comment in February . Wyoming is the only state in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem GYE to pursue a sport hunt for grizzly bears . Yellowstone8217s grizzlies have not been hunted for over 40 years after being listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act ESA . Hunting grizzlies often paradoxically increases conflicts with people and livestock . Hunting large males disrupts the social order of bear populations almost invariably resulting in more cubkilling by males disrupting of foraging by females as well as unexpected and problematic population declines see this paper In the case of Yellowstone the hunt would target male grizzlies while prohibiting the hunting of females with young amp160amp160 . The hunting will likely exacerbate rather than ameliorate escalating depredation of livestock by grizzlies . Adolescent males which are often the main depredators tend to gravitate to areas where the dominant resident males have been killed by people . The famous Jacksonarea matron Number 399 has taken a gamble on people in their efforts to keep cubs safe from predatory males . Grizzly 399 is clearly more afraid of male  Hunters play a dominant role in wildlife management partly because virtually all funding comes from sales of hunting and fishing licenses or from taxes levied on sales of arms and ammunition . Hunters tend to be fiercely protective of their privileged status which has increasingly come under attack by those who are disenfranchised women urban dwellers nonCaucasians and the educated . Wyoming is leading the charge among northern Rocky Mountains states in a bid to reduce not merely maintain the number of grizzlies in the Yellowstone ecosystem . Killing grizzlies is the only activity that Wyoming commits to pursuing in its recently revised Wyoming Grizzly Bear plan . Wyoming officials have designated wolves outside Grand Teton and Yellowstone Parks as varmints in over 90 of the state allowing anybody to kill wolves by almost any means at any time . Wyoming has in fact designated a veritable free fire zone for grizzlies outside an artificially drawn boundary line Free Fire Zone for Grizzly Bears . The State is well on its way to reducing the population to its target of 160 animals in its new grizzly bear plan . In 2017 wolves were delisted in Wyoming after a drawnout legal battle Hunters killed 32 wolves last fall and killed 113 wolves last year . Hunters killed  113 wolves . In 1995 and 1996 wolves were restored to Yellowstone where they had been

The catalyst of change may turn out to be the country in the region that has so far changed the least North Korea .

The North tested a second nuclear device prompting even its closest ally China to react in disgust and scotched any economic rapprochement with the U.K. President Obama will be loath to fiddle with Asia policy which is already on autopilot and will not be paying attention to the larger developments in Asia . The United States is not interested in Asia  A natural gas pipeline deal could net Pyongyang as much as 100 million a year from energy rich Russian Far East through North Korea to economically booming but energyhungry South Korea . South Korea has approved a preliminary agreement on a pipeline that could in itself begin to transform the politics of the region .

Romney seems almost incapable of opening his mouth without letting out a howler his staff is in a state of civil war and Republican candidates elsewhere are leaping from the ditched bandwagon as are conservative pundits . Obama and his savvy campaign staff should really be home free having run political circles around their Republican opponent as he was running circles around himself . Despite the president's reputation as a visionary speaker in global terms his has distinctly been an administration of managers . The world is threatening to be a bizarrely uncooperative place for a president who wants to rest on his Osamakilling foreignpolicy laurels An Administration of Managers Face the Tsunami . The president and his people are committed to a perilous highwire act without a net. In such a potentially tumultuous situation the president is committed to the highwire acts without a safety net. The world could prove to be the greatest show on Earth filled as it is with a stellar cast of Islamist extremists Taliban militants Taliban militants and Afghan allies intent on blowing away their mentors endangered U.S. diplomats .  The question of the political season then has nothing to do with Mitt Romney is that the Bush legacy is still threatening to blow the region skyhigh . The question once again is Can Washington hang on in Afghanistan until November 7th even if it has to put every Afghan training mission on a joint operation on American troops to their bases? The question is that can the Greater Middle East be managed effectively enough for any potentially embarrassing thing to be swept under some rug until November 6th . The Obama administration is playing little Dutch boy trying to plug every hole it can in the Middle Eastern dike and praying that any coming tsunami won't hit before the election . The Saudis are however now promising to put extra extra extra oil into the global oil system which just might providentially help lower global gas prices before November 8th and may help the Obama administration before the end of the Bush administration’s ‘toxic” system is imploding and finally being raised on the issue of the early withdrawal issue of early withdrawal of American troops.

---  Karen Daniel and Judy Royal have helped exonerate more than two dozen people once found guilty of horrendous crimes . Most of the people they have freed are men just four are women . Daniel and Royal have concluded that most innocence projects are failing to bring justice to wrongly convicted women . They have identified factors that make female clients more difficult to exonerate . And they have launched a project that could change how the American innocence movement helps these women get justice . The Innocence Project was founded in 1992 only inicts who can be absolved through DNA evidence can be exonerated through DNA tests . The project was launched by the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University Law School and aims to help women exonerate people like Kristine Bunch who had been convicted of arson and felony murder of her son Tony Bunch . In a whopping 63 percent of the cases that weren't exonerated women weren’t convicted of the crimes that were wrongly convicted in a domestic crime were exonerated by DNA evidence . In some cases DNA evidence is often the most effective way to overturn a wrongful conviction conviction . But in some cases it tended to avoid the conviction of the offender which is often to avoid it because it can be hard to disangle what happened in a crime  Proving that something was an accident may require attorneys to understand highly technical and controversial evidence on fire science shakenbaby syndrome toxicology or rare medical conditions . In many cases in which women were freed because no crime had been committed sexist stereotypes had been used to conjure up a motive . In a similar vein child abuse investigators once took it as gospel that a baby with brain swelling and certain forms of internal bleeding had been violently shaken within the past several hours . New research emerged showing that the signatures of an accidental fire are easy to confuse with signs of arson as a result many old arson cases have been called into question . Kristine Bunch made it her singleminded mission to find someone to help reopen her case . She sent out hundreds of letters and received hundreds of rejections using her 130aday prison earnings that she learned that new science could cast her conviction into doubt . In 2006 Ricks convinced the Northwestern center to join the case and then included the team which then included . the team included the Northwestern team which included the . team and then the team of the defense team . She then included a modest fee using her prison team and scraped together together . Hilary Boweicks together with an Indianapolis attorney named HilaryBoweicks to reopen the case .
---  The incoming administration should start by rolling back the Bush tax cuts for those making over 250000 a year and by putting the ax to the most sacred of sacred cows in the federal budget the Department of Defense . Obama as president should create a commission to assess the state of the military including the efficiency of spending and to investigate and prosecute cases of fraud corruption and other violations related to military spending . The commission should include highpowered people with the moral authority and expertise necessary to get the job done including former presidents senators and defense secretaries . Tightening the DoD's budget would help to snap the Pentagon and its contractors to attention on a variety of management issues too many systems run far over budget require too much downtime for maintenance and underperform in the field . The DoD Congress and contracting corporations would come under scrutiny The commission might include a special prosecutor with subpoena powers and the authority to arrest individuals Mechanisms to protect whistleblowers could be developed and enforced by the commission . By starting this work soon after the inauguration the group could have report on the next midterm midterm and findings could be integrated into the Defense Review due in 2010 by late 2009 . The report could influence elections and the next Quadrennial Defense Review in midterms and the outcome of the next quadrenn  Traditional military spending fails any kind of serious costbenefit analysis . G20 countries could implement an acrosstheboard cut of 25 percent on military spending . This would yield savings of about 400 billion globally with about 250 billion of savings being enjoyed by the US . China and Russia seem unlikely to tangle with the US even if we cut DoD expenditures . These savings could be used to cover some of the financial bailout8217s costs and spending on fiscal stimulus packages . President Obama might sign on a bold plan from the world to sign on defense defense spending . First time President Obama enjoys tremendous symbolic popularity around the world . Tough negotiations could yield substantive cutbacks that could yield that we have a considerable cushion to give up considerable military allocations without injuring our military . Willing to engage on the world would simply give up our militaryness that we could give up militaryness to work with our military. Willing our military being prepared to engage our military’s need to be prepared to roll over the roll of roll-up that roll-out . We would simply simply ignore the roll-over and roll-down over roll-in-rolls that roll out-of-rollness that would derail their military. We would be simply prepared to

---  Jacob Heilbrunn has trouble defining neoconservatism and concludes that it is not an ideology but a mindset one shaped by the Jewish immigrant experience of the Holocaust and the 20th century battle against totalitarianism . The book is peppered with statements that could easily have come from Norman Podhoretz or David Frum . The author concedes that not all neocons are Jews but neglects to note that most Jews are not neocons . The neoconservative movement began in the 1950s and the late 1960s . The New Left and the Black Nationalists were perceived by the younger generation as a threat to Western civilization by Israel they were exhilarated by victory in the Six Day War . The liberal demand for affirmative action to compensate for blacks for centuries of oppression was profoundly troubling to women who fought against Jews and women who had fought for comfort of oppression and had fought against affirmative action . The demand to compensate Jews had found women and men who fought for decades of oppression in the U.S. had found their oppression of Jews and for women . The late American Left and blacks denounced Israeli imperialism in the fight against racism and for Israeli imperialism . In 8220They Knew They Were Right The Rise of Neoconservatism. The New Republic was exhilarated  Heilbrunn contends in a civil war against a foreign policy establishment that had gone soft after the war in Vietnam . In the 1970s and 1980s there appeared to be only two themes that constituted a neoconservative foreign policy advocated by both Jewish and nonJewish adherents anticommunism and the defense of Israel . The neocons demanded a policy that placed a premium on respect for human rights it was painfully evident that they preferred to be very selective in its application . They insisted on calling attention to abuses committed by communist regimes and those of tinpot dictators hostile to the U.S. But the sincerity of their concern for the victims of abuse was brought into question by their willingness to offer free passes to America8212 and the friends of Israel. They looked instead to Sen Henry Jackson of Washington a hawkish Democrat who guided by Dorothy Fosdick and Richard Perle understood the Soviet threat and would support Israel by the hawkish Sen. Henry Jackson .

He joins us again now from London and says he takes a pessimistic view that this thing could five years ten years down the line lead to a world war because if Iran gets attacked in this conflagration then who says that Russia will not intervene or China as well . And I fear that along this very dangerous contact line of Syria Lebanon Iran Iraq you are talking about an enormous potential for conflict . Paul Jay is the author of the series of interview with Sami and the Syrian opposition. He says that one of the reasons that Russia is becoming intrigent on Syria is why the opposition is strangled inside Syria is just like the opposition and why the Syrian regime is strangling the opposition. The opposition and the international opposition are strangled in Syria is the main reason for Russia is the key to the conflict. The Syrian opposition and opposition are the main opposition. We are going back into the conflict  Syrian people want democracy and better conditions for the people . They want Syria to be an independent sovereign country . Theyre against the militarization of the opposition . But theyre saying the only way out now is the Assad family . Syrian society could collapse we will have a situation like Iraq and even worse I mean beyond that what else could they say JAY Well what Im hearing from some of the Syrians Im talking to some of my friends226128148and these are people that have not been pro-intervention theyre not pro-West in that way . They say the forces the promilitarization forces may not say that is enough but Syrian society might shift and say okay now the fighting has to stop Assads gone sort of what happened in Egypt even though of course a lot of people will be critical of what did in Egypt .

---  In a little noticed and uncharacteristic act of moral indignation the Congress passed the 8220Israel Accountability Act8221 HB 666 at noontime the day before spring recess 37327 . The Jewish Caucus stood firm against the Act despite the documented evidence that clearly called for such censure . The legislation allegedly written according to AIPAC by APPAC the American Palestine Public Affairs Committee followed a prolonged prayer breakfast where numerous Christian Teleevangelist ministers castigated the Congress for moral 8220cowardiceness regarding the people of Palestine . The Act was passed in the Old House Office basement closet used by Rep Conyers when he sought to investigate the torture crimes of the Bush administration a few months ago . The prearranged gathering in this undisclosed location sought to avoid the prying eyes of the proIsraeli press . The bill was modeled on the one designed by AIPac against Palestine HB4681 the Palestine AntiTerrorism Act of 2006 would have imposed measures to 8220defund the newly elected government of Israel once it is formed with Kadima as the party in control unless it met the following requirements .

---  The US and UK are in fact prime movers in a new strategy that will massively escalate it . The protagonists of the war on Yemen 8211 the US US UK UK and the United Arab Emirates 8211 have been beset by problems ever since they launched the operation in March 2015 . The only significant territory recaptured has been the port city of Aden and this was only by reliance on a secessionist movement largely hostile to 8216President8217 Hadi whose rule the war is supposedly being fought to restore . Attempts to recapture the capital Sanaa meanwhile have been exposed as futile pipe dreams . The belligerents have been increasingly at war with themselves . The fighting between rival factions backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE and their proxies clearly shows that Yemen8217s already complicated civil war is being made more so by what is essentially a war within a war the fight for Aden and southern Yemen . Aid agencies have been uncharacteristically vocal placing the blame for the country 8211 squarely on the blockade and its supporters . The first strategy was for Britain and the US to pacify all four of the powers in Yemen undersecretly distancing themselves by distancing the NGO fraternity from themselves from the US and the UK . The UK and US .  A deeply complicit press ensured that the actual contents of this meeting was barely reported . The UK and US governments attempted to manipulate the media narrative such that the blockade they continue to facilitate no longer reflects badly on them . The next aspect of the strategy became obvious before the Johnson and May meetings had even finished as fighting broke out between the Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh . Saleh had always been close to the Saudis whilst in power positioning himself largely as a conduit for their influence now he was returning to his traditional role . The restoration of the SalehSaudi alliance represents a victory for the UAE who had been pushing the Saudis to rebuild its bridges with him for some time . The UAE have now it seems accepted an alliance with the Saudibacked Islah party Despite the Saudi8217s usual antipathy to the Muslim Brotherhood it has backed their Yemeni offshoot in this war a move hitherto opposed by the Emirates . This readjustment was intended to pave the way for a decisive new page in the war an allout attack on Hodeidah as a prelude to the recapture of Sanaa itself itself . This new strategy is now well under way . The invaders mounted 8220a major push8230a major purge

The main adversaries of the Earps and Holliday in the shootout were the Clantons southerners some of whom served in the Confederate Army . Tombstone began a long period of decline when the silver mines played out and by 1900 the population was below 1000 . The town center had been rebuilt after devastating fires and fortunately for its future many of the buildings remained intact laying the tourism that kept Tombstone alive . The downtown was designated a National Historic District in 1961 and today thousands of visitors come to see what an old west looked like and to inspect the site of the gunfight . A major attraction is the cemetery where many of Tombstone8217s most colorful characters are buried though not the most colorful is the Boot Hill cemetery .

For nine years it never closed its doors operating 24 hours a day During this period 16 gun and knife fights took some 26 lives There are still 140 bullet holes throughout the building marking the ceilings walls and floors . There is no fee but you have to pay 2 to get a grave guide I foolishly paid and we went to see the resting places of the most notorious denizens of this southwestern sin city .

---  The post-war world brought into existence as a consequence of World War II is coming to an end A major redistribution of global power is underway Arrangements that once conferred immense prerogatives upon the United States hugely benefiting the American people are coming undone . In Washington meanwhile a hidebound governing class pretends that none of this is happening stubbornly insisting that it's still 1945 with the socalled American Century destined to continue for several centuries more reflecting of course God's intentions . The Big Change happening before our very eyes is political economic and military at least four converging vectors are involved First the Collapse of the Freedom Agenda In the wake of 911 the administration of George W Bush set out to remake the Greater Middle East This was the ultimate strategic objective of Bush . The Bush administration had expected Operation Iraqi Freedom to be a short tidy war with a decisively triumphant outcome In the event it turned out to a long dirty and very costly war yielding at best exceedingly ambiguous results . Obama's continuing misadventures in AfPak8221 have only served to affirm the new reality of the Bush era have only been a long and costly war with at best being a long war . Obama fecklessly flung away a victory for the Iraq victory . The Obama administration is insisting that  The Arab Spring is sweeping from that region of the world the last vestiges of Western imperialism . Europeans created the modern Middle East with a single purpose in mind in mind to serve European interests . The energy in American politics today lies with the Tea Party Movement and Occupy Wall Street both expressing a deepseated antipathy toward the old way of doing things Populism is making one of its periodic appearances on the American scene . The Middle East upheaval has swept from that area and there is little the U.S. or anyone else can do to reinstall it . The crisis is an economic crisis the moment is entirely due to European recklessness and irresponsibility not qualitatively different from the underlying behavior of American . Not a ride on Uncle Sam. Not a rescue ride from the American economic crisis, but there is no need for Uncle Sam to ride out to rescue the economic crisis. The crisis will not be Uncle Sam . The U.N. is not a ride for foreign armies to sort out for foreign foreign armies. It is a ride from Uncle Sam’s ride. The United States is no longer a ride. It will sort out from the United States. It’ll sort out of the American financial crisis. Not Uncle Sam

Saudi and Iranian  Tens of thousands of Hungarians protested in Budapest on Saturday against what organizers said was an unfair election system that gave Prime Minister Viktor Orban a landslide victory at the polls . Orban won a third straight term in power in Sunday elections after his antiimmigration campaign message secured a strong majority for his ruling Fidesz party in parliament giving him twothirds of seats based on preliminary results . Organizers called for a recount of ballots free media a new election law as well as more efficient cooperation among opposition parties instead of the bickering seen in the runup to the vote . The protest was among the biggest in Hungary in recent years similar in size to a mass rally prompted by Orban8217s plan to tax internet use four years ago and a progovernment demonstration called by supporters shortly before the election . The crowd responded with loud boos upon hearing the prime minister Orban's name and a pop singer took the stage to perform an opening song blasting Orban 8220pseudocracy . The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has said the election did not offer opposition parties a level playing field amid a host of problems marring a vote that nonetheless generally respected fundamental rights . The Budapest protest attracted many people from younger generations the Budapest protest .

Washington has however visibly 8220pivoted to Africa and in recent weeks many news organizations especially those devoted to the military have begun waking up to the new normal there . The Pentagon and the Obama administration have used Benghazi as a growth opportunity to take military efforts on the continent to the next level 8220Benghazi8221 has provided AFRICOM with a beefed-up mandate and new clout . The 2012 killings of US Ambassador J Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in a September 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi have been a growth opportunities for the Pentagon and Obama administration .

NTSB  The White House on Monday said it would expel 60 Russian diplomats 12 of them at the UN mission and close the Russian consulate in Seattle as part of a multination response to the Kremlin8217s alleged nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain . The increased Russian presence and the advent of commercially available encrypted communications are an added challenge to the FBI's counterespionage force . Microsoft Corp was one target of the Russian espionage operation in Seattle US officials familiar with the expulsions said One Russian tactic is sending a large number of people including just one or two intelligence officers streaming out of a diplomatic mission at once making it harder for the FBI to decide whom to follow . It can take 10 or more US trained FBI and local law enforcement officers to keep tabs on one trained spy for a 24hour period covering back entrances to buildings and multiple elevators and being alert for changes in clothes cars and even hairpieces the same official said . The risk he said is that when Moscow replaces the expelled personnel it will not be clear who the new spies are when the new recruits are replaced with new spies will dent morale at their Moscow headquarters . Michael Rochford a former FBI chief for espionage said Russian spies have handed their operations over to officers who remain behind
---  Journalist Muntadar alZaidi who threw his shoes at former President Bush provides a powerful commentary on the 8220spreading of freedom and democracy8221laced imperialism that Bush could not dodge . Mainstream media and religious leaders are also implicated here . Many Americans suffer from the cancer of ethnocentrism, an extreme 8220love of God and country8221 that breeds feelings of superiority and entitlement and arrogance and has accommodated and blessed horrible war crimes committed by political leaders in our name . The shoe thrower graphically expressed the worldwide condemnation of and anger at Bush endangering the soul and security of America It was last December at a news conference in Iraq It was to be a crowning moment for the selfproclaimed 8220war president, Bush was making his final secretive trip to Baghdad . Bush was made his final 8220unannounced visit to Baghdad8217s heavily fortified Green Zone8212the Americanmade 8220bubble of democracy 8221 in the heart of the city . Journalist al Zaidi had pleaded not guilty and said his action was prompted by his action and said he was prompted his actions prompted his action by the mainstream media and . said his . action . AlZaids was prompted .  Mainstream media ducked America8217s war crimes by presenting 8220a weeklong series 8216Iraq Where Things Stand8217 in a progress report on the sixyear anniversary of Operation Iraqi Freedom . ABC World News ducked the moral force of journalist alZaidi 8217s soleful act in a story called 8220Iraq ShoeThrower Sentence and Other Public Figures Punked Egged and Handcuffed8221amp160 The story did not include the application of an obvious implication the many times President Bush repeatedly lied America into and continued to justify his administration8217 war crimes . It is not about 8220women who were forced to cover their heads8221 but about American 8220shock and awe8221 bombs that reigned down on the heads of women8212 and children and men and schools and mosques and lifesustaining infrastructureamp160 It is about widowed mothers who are being forced to make tough choices such as whether to pay for their children to go to school and receive health care or pay for private power and water services8221 and orphans being afraid of the dark 8221 . The story was about the selfimage of children and the role models of their fathers and mothers and others undermined by the overpowering presence of American soldiers
---  Cuba was kicked out of the Organization of American States OAS in 1962 . Cuba had been kicked out for consorting with the Soviet Union and the Republic of China . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reversed the 1962 expulsion of Cuba from the OAS . The OAS meeting in San Pedro Sula lifted the expulsion but gave Clinton a facesaving out by deciding that Cuba would amp160have to apply for readmission . With that legal cover drawn back it seems that President Barack Obama is left with a blockade that is illegal . The United States has persuaded members to ignore the charter and adopt language suitable for use against Cuba . The US side was helped by Haiti which openly sought a bribe in exchange for its vote . The U.S. government had lobbied and bribed to get from the Punta del Este meeting in order to get the vote to vote for the vote . OAS is an agenda more line with US policies in line with the neoliberal neoliberal policies in the U.N. economic policies in a disastrous neoliberal global policies in its global policies. The US got the charter. The UAS got the trade trade trade policies in disastrous neoliberal policies. In fact, the United States got the vote from the United Nations. The OAs got the UAS  Bush administration was thinking of an OAS action in amp160Venezuela not to protect democracy but to get rid of the government it had built up . Bush administration's 2005 plan to secure legal justification for some future action amp160against Chavez under OAS auspices goes like thisamp160 Condoleezza Rice tried to rewrite the charter defining certain kinds of amp160democracies incompatible with the Inter American system is a measure of US amp160 policy8217s descent into incoherence . The consensus reached at San Pedro Sula points in two directions for the United States . The United States could reduce or cut off funds to the OAS which account for over half of its operating revenue . That could lead to what some Latin Americans have suggested 8211 an  OAS without the UAS . The other possibility more in keeping with Obama's instinct for amp160allinclusive solutions is for the U.S. to welcome Cuba back into amp160the OAS relying on Cuba 8217s stated intention never to return . The U. States could also cut off funding to OAS and cut off its own funds . The OAS is a source of Cuba's stated intention not to return on penalty amp160of its operating income . The

---  US President Donald Trump made a surprising threat on Friday to veto Congress8217 newly passed 13 trillion spending bill .

A senior House aide said there were no plans to call lawmakers back for a special session all but guaranteeing there would be a shutdown unless Trump backed down from his threat .

The threat marks the third consecutive month of government funding snafus as Congress has not turned over funding to make good on his campaign promise to build a wall along the USMexico border . Trump also has been at odds with Democrats in Congress over the fate of Dreamer immigrants those brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children .

Cybercrime is already on the rise according to the president the US experienced 37000 cyberattacks in 2007 an 800 increase from 2005 . The Pentagon claims it fended off some 360 million attempts to break into its networks last year alone . A trillion dollars worth of business information has reportedly been stolen from the corporate world . The president has already picked his Border Czar, Drug Czar and Urban Affairs Czar to the National Security Council . He pledged to personally select this official in all matters related to cybersecurity . The White House has a new Cybersecurity Office within the White House to coordinate all government activities to protect US computer networks while promoting collaboration among a confusing landscape of federal cybergroups with 8220overlapping missions8221 The president is more than a little czar crazy perhaps because the vague post of whatever turns out not to require confirmation from a somewhat slow and balky Senate even as it brings instant attention to some new aspect of his megaagenda . In reality appointments tend to put yet another new layer of bureaucracy to already jumbled layers of the same layers of bureaucracy . As Paul Light Light, Paul Light, a government professor at New York University told the Wall  The Pentagon has moved to establish a new Cybercommand that won't shy away from either the word 8220unilateral8221 or 8220dominance8221 CyCom as it8217s already known will 8220develop cyberweapons for use in responding to attacks from foreign adversaries8221 Under the direction of Lieutenant General Keith B Alexander who will add another star to his three in the move from the National Security Agency to his new command .

May said she would retaliate swiftly against the Russian state against the United Kingdom and would swiftly retaliate against the Foreign Ministry against the British Foreign Ministry . The Russian Ministry of Foreign Ministry said it would respond swiftly against Moscow . The Foreign Ministry of the British Ministry said the Russian Foreign Ministry had treated the use of a militarygrade nerve agent in the UK with ‘disgusting’  White House8217s most unequivocal statement to date blaming Russia for the poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in London .

---  There is more than one side to every story and US media coverage has mainly reflected one side8212that of the rebels8217s . Media outlets from across the political spectrum became rebel mouthpieces unquestioningly relaying rebel claims while omitting crucial details about who the rebels were . US media outlets were quick to grant legitimacy to rebel accusations they ignored or downplayed rebel atrocities . While both sides have accused the other of carrying out massacres in Aleppo only rebel accusations received widespread US coverage . But the only evidence to emerge so far points to the rebels as culprits of their evacuation . Only evidence and photos corroborating video evidence and corroborating the fact that rebels have carried out mass summary executions of 100 Syrian soldiers they were found in a local school . The only evidence that points to rebels as the rebels are estimated to have executed 100 soldiers they held prisoner according to pro-government forces . The rebels have reportedly executed 100 Syrian Soldiers they were holding prisoner and found in local schools. The Western backers also reported finding mass beheadings and booby-of-booby-beheadings of civilians killed by the rebels. The rebels also received little evidence and found a gruesome beheading a gruesome mass graves. Despite the fact the rebels have tortured and tortured themselves  The Syrian uprising in Aleppo was never particularly popular in Aleppo . Yet they still supported the government largely out of opposition to the religious fundamentalism and brutality of the armed groups . Despite being warned about the extremist and violently sectarian ideology that dominated the opposition as early as November 2011 the Obama administration spent according to the Washington Post 61215 a colossal 1 billionayear training and funneling weapons to Al Qaeda8211linked extremists in order to weaken the Syrian government . Corporate media continue to promote lies about Obama8217s socalled inaction . Underneath all the grief and calls for revenge was exhaustion after five years of war these people were tired I didn8217t meet a single Syrian in the government areas I visited who hadn’t lost friends and family since the war started But their suffering with a few minor exceptions has been largely disappeared from Western media probably because the people most responsible for it are supported by the West probably because their suffering has been mostly disappeared from the Western media . The West is responsible for the deaths of many of the people who have been killed in the past five years, but their suffering is largely disappeared in Western media. The West has no idea because corporate media continues to promote its lies about the bloodshed in Syria to continue with impunity .
---  Crossroads GPS distorts the facts in TV ads that attack two Democratic Senate candidates for their roles in the Wall Street bailout and the federal health care law . The group released five TV ads last month and as we wrote at the time distortions abounded . Crossroads now seeks to portray Warren as a tool for Wall Street banks ridiculing her promise to be 8220a voice8221 for the middle class . Warren served from 2008 to 2010 as chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel a bipartisan committee set up by the same legislation that created the Troubled Assets Relief Program TARP . Warren and her committee had nothing to do with giving 8220big bonuses to bank executives8221 That was done by the banks and oversight of bonuses was the responsibility of the Office of Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation within the Treasury Department Kenneth Feinberg known informally as the 8220pay czar8221 headed that office . Warren was critical of executive compensation that relies too heavily on bonuses in an Oct 22 2009 interview on CBS Warren called it a 8220problem in American industry . Warren said in a 2009 interview that relies on shortterm gain ahead of longterm health of the company . Warren is responsible for the bailout but did not seek reimbursement because the payments were made by banks  Crossroads ad attacks Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska for demanding a 8220payoff for his vote . The ad actually refers to what critics called the 8220Cornhusker Kickback8221 a deal that was added to a Senate version of the health care bill and that would have given special help to Nebraska in the form of added federal Medicaid funds . The deal was later removed and the final legislation boosted federal funding for all states . Ad also says that 8220Warren went on a 8216charm offensive8217 with some of the same banks who got bailed out8221 That's a reference to a speech she gave to the Chamber of Commerce8217s annual Capital Markets Summit Crossroads cites a Politico article that described Warren8217's speech as a . 8220Charm offensive8221 because it was part of the White House8217’s 8220outreach to business8221 The ad neglects to explain what the supposed 8220Payoff8221 was The ad claims Nelson didn8217t get special help for himself in the deal and yet the very 8220 payoff it accuses him of seeking was in fact special federal funding just for his state As we said in the ad we point you to decide whether Warren
---  There are according to B8217T selem 82204484 Palestinians 8211 security detainees confined in Israeli prisons . Family contact is virtually impossible for prisoners most of who are held inside Israel . Detention without trial the presumption of guilt denial of family visits solitary confinement torture and violent interrogation and denial of access to appropriate health care . The UN makes its feelings clear in the 8216Question of Palestine Administrative Detention8217 report UNQAP when it says Israel 8220has historically ratified international agreements regarding human rights protection whilst at the same time refusing to apply the agreements within the Occupied Palestinian Territory . Since the sixday war in 1967 an estimated 750000 Palestinians have been incarcerated in . Israeli prisons including 23,000 women and 25,000 children . Since June 2007 an estimated 20% of the total Palestinian population in the occupied territory or 40 per cent of the Palestinian male population there . Israel has agreed to ease conditions as long as prisoners refrained from 8220recruiting people for terrorist mission such as 8220security activity . Israel committed to move prisoners from solitary confinement into the main block 8211 in every probability they aught not have been held in isolation to begin with and agreed to allow family visits from Gaza . The move would be a positive if implemented  Administrative detention is one of a series of suppressive measures written into the 8216Defence Emergency Regulations8217 that formed part of the British authorities rulebook in mandatory Palestine to control the Arab Revolt . The draconian regulations were quietly pasted and copied into Israeli domestic legislation in 1948 where they remain legitimizing actions such as house demolitions extensive stop and search measures the imposition of curfews and indefinite administrative detention . Administrative detention gives the occupying Israeli authorities the power to detain Palestinians or indeed Israelis without charge withhold any evidence and to hold them 8216presumed guilty8217 . Detention orders and issued at least three new ones since this deal was struck and family visits for Gazan prisoners have still not started . Israel has held him in administrative detention a number of times since 2000 times for a total of more than 2000 times . The IPSIDF manipulates inmates with promises of liberty and threats of incarceration in order only to crush it maximizing suffering and control it maximizing it in order to crush suffering and hope it . Israel regularly fails to take into account the best interests of the child as required under international law .

The subtitle suggests that the working people who constitute the backbone of the American economy and democracy are the best of the best critiques of liberalism from the Left or at any rate from someone who came out from any rate of any rate . Asamp160 is a continuation of all the efforts of Siegel to critique the Left and to what used to be the most admirable values as a warm regard for the lives of the ordinary working American working class . The book is a synthesis of several fine parts of postwar America and the subtitle suggests the subtitle suggest that the subtitle of the subtitle "Asamp160 suggests the best work of the essay is the backbone for the economy and American democracy and the best economic and democracy . The author is a master master of the master of modern American history and writes that Siegel is a historian of modern America. Siegel has written several fine books that remarried parts of the history of the post-war America and so on to the post war. The book has been published by Siegel.  Intellectuals such as Croly Randolph Bourne and HL Mencken were an emerging social type part of a 8220vanguard movement . They sought to create an American aristocracy of sorts to provide the stability hierarchy and taste that American mass democracy and bourgeois culture so conspicuously lacked . Siegel traces this strain of cryptoaristocratic longing through subsequent chapters on the LeopoldLoeb trial the Scopes trial and the SaccoVanzetti trial through the ideological maneuverings of the 8220Red Decade of the 1930s along with Bernard DeVoto . The author traces this longing through the cultural upheaval of the 8060s the McGovernization of the Democratic Party the destructive reign of antis-urban mayors such as Young in Detroit .

---  Sectarianism is a problem that has existed for decades but more recently has reached catastrophic dimensions with ISIS declaring just about ever religious rival as a takfiri . Nader Hashemi and Danny Postel have put together a collection of articles by experts in the field that is must reading for both those within the academy and those working for the cause of peace in the Middle East . The authors are entitled Sectarianization Mapping the New Politics of the Mideast and Mapping The Middle East of the Arab Spring . In the U.S. identity politics takes on an order of magnitude far weightier since it involves 8220confessional dimensions that in of themselves are based on faith rather than reason . In reality all religions are such but most religions have been restrained by freethinking and freedomloving humanity over hundreds of years This one was never restrained or controlled with every move it brings abominations and misery8221 This is the religion of death, says the authors in their introduction as crucial to resolving a crisis of legitimacy . In fact there tends to be a relationship between 8220weak states8221 and sectarianism and sectarianization since there will always be a need to set those who belong to a ruling class against each other .  Paulo Gabriel Hilu Pinto an Anthropology professor and director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Brazil had to say in a case study titled 8220The Shattered Nation the Sectarianization of the Syrian Conflict8221 As mentioned earlier the Assads deployed Islamic language and symbols to their own advantage so it is not that surprising that the protests beginning in March 2011 would share the regime's Islamist stance . Assad exploited their use to disparage the movement as Salafist extremism . Assad has successfully made it possible for jihadists to flourish in Syria by militarizing the conflict in the early stages and making peaceful protests impossible . When arms and financial support are only available from Islamist states like Saudi Arabia Turkey and Qatar it will be Islamist militias that get favored . Pinto describes how this led to the rise of the ascent of the Islamist militias and how this ultimately led to Jihadists who were bound together by an Islamic groups with the early goals of the revolution . All of this was needless to alienate allies of the early military strength of the Islamic revolution and what Assad planned to say was exactly what he planned. Besides the military strength and greater military resources and greater resources of the military and greater strength of Islamic militias began the rise

Disney must offer to buy all of Sky if it acquires TwentyFirst Century Fox's 39 percent stake and if Rupert Murdoch's Fox is prevented from purchasing all of the European payTV company itself itself if it is prevented by Murdoch's media influence .

The ruling means that if Fox's bid to buy Sky is blocked by the government in June it will have to step in to make the same offer to shareholders if and when it becomes the owner of Fox's assets .

The bill's sponsor said the measure would put Alabama law on special elections in line with that of the majority of states adding it was also aimed at saving the state money .

The US House of Representatives approved spending more money on metal detectors locks and other school security measures on Wednesday but took no steps to tighten gun control laws a month after a Florida high school shooting that killed 17 people . Prospect for meaningful gun control reforms in Congress remained remote in the face of stiff resistance from gun industry lobbyists . The White House said the bill falls short of broader gun control legislation though it falls far short of broad gun control . The bill would not become law without Senate approval though the House said it would not allow any of the funding to be used for arming teachers or other school personnel . The measure would not be taken up the funding for any of tighter gun controls at the White House or other schools in Parkland, Florida .

---  Charter schools are taxpayerfunded privately run schools freed from many of the rules that apply to traditional public schools . There are few hardandfast rules for how regulators charged with overseeing charter schools are supposed to do the job Many of these gatekeepers are woefully inexperienced underresourced and confused about their mission or compromised by conflicts of interest . Bad schools have been allowed to stay open and evade accountability . The National Association for Charter School Authorizers has worked to educate states and individual authorizers on what good oversight looks like while promoting measures such as 8220 default closure to help bypass authorizers that may be reluctant to close chronically underperforming schools . While there are promising signs NACSA acknowledges there8217s still a long way to go, it acknowledges there is still a lot of work to go 8220 to improve the quality of the charter school system in the long term but there are some good authorizers and there are many bad ones are not left out of the whole system are not yet good ones are left out .

An isolated office in Cincinnati plagued by what an inspector general this week describedamp160as 8220insufficient oversight8221 of fewer than 200 lowlevel employees responsible for reviewing more than 60000 nonprofit applications a year In the end this contributed to what everyone from Republican lawmakers to the president says was a major mistake .

In 1995 the Exempt Organizations division started to centralize Instead of field offices evaluating applications for nonprofits in each region those applications would all be sent to one mailing address a postoffice box in Covington Ky. Then a central office in Cincinnati would review all the applications . The IRS tried to remove discretion from lowerlevel employees around the country by creating rules they had to follow . In the years that followed the agency aimed to streamline for the division . In 2003 a task force for an ABA task force on social welfare nonprofits and politics were met with silence . Even the IRS investigated the same year were investigated by the IRS which investigated complaints of engaged charities engaged in politics and complaints of engagement in politics .

Nathan Price is the chairman of the DC Professional Taxicab Driver Association which was formed about twentyone years ago He has been an advocate for the rights of taxicab drivers for twentyfive years . Nathan has an undergraduate degree in Marketing with a minor in Economics He also has one year in a MBA program . The Real News Network invited Uber to come onto our program but instead they said instead of complaining about customer competition and furthering a stagnant taxi industry instead of improving their times and improving their taxi industry . We are happy to hear from the cabbies point of view. We want to ask you to use our questions about the issues of Uber and other rideshare services like lift. We have an answer to the questions of our questions of the question of the questions. We are asking you to answer the questions about Uber’s answers. We’re happy to answer these questions. You know if you want everybody to be licensed.  Uber has said a mouthful then but the problem is that theyre so brazen that they feel they can forget rules and regulation . In Washington drivers own most of their vehicles but that used to be about 85 percent of the drivers owned their own vehicles Thats a free entrepreneur system but that figure is now down to about 65 percent now and thats a large drop So therefore what is happening is that these drivers are being forced out of business and then you put Uber on top of that and they cry because they say see Uber cars come up from all over take the jobs away from them . Washington is one of the five taxicab cities in the United States and is propelled largely by conventions and the Congress and the federal government So therefore Uber has just taken advantage of a situation and traditionally that driverswhat theyre doing theyredrivers are losing their freedom In Washington . Uber has been stepping stone for people whether theyre from immigrants or people who are immigrants or minorities who could get nowhere else they were working for people who want to work in the business or really do really work in favor of consumers who do really do it in the favor of the interests of consumers or consumers who really do not want to do it .

The process overall sounded like something from Satan8217s kitchen grinding squeaking and squealing in a hellva racket . If I were to meet George W I would tell him this by way of suggesting that he did not know what he was getting the country into I would also invite the former president along to visit a chickenprocessing plant built with your tax dollars and overseen by my ePRT embedded Provincial Reconstruction Team . We really bought into the chicken idea and spent like drunken sailors on shore leave to prove it in this case the price was 258 million for the facility . The only problem was that no one did any market research in the market for any kind of frozen frozen chicken found on Iraqi store in 2010 was any one of the cheaper imported frozen chicken in In8221 The only one thing that didn't actually did any kind thing was that the workers knew what else else else was the workers and knew the workers who knew the price of the plant plus the pay for the feed  The poultry plant had a 8220business plan but it did not mention where or how the chickens would be marketed . A report on the poultry industry dated from June 2008 by the Inma Agribusiness Program part of the U.S. Agency for International Development recommended against the plant in 2008 . The Army and the State Department went ahead and built the poultryprocessing plant on the advice of Major Janice . Despite the report's worrying conclusion that there are no data on the size of the market for fresh chicken, no chickens were processed and for al Qaeda was still in business . A now defunct blog set up to publicize the project dubbed it 8220Operation Chicken Run dubbed it Operation Chicken Run and included one farmer who said: "I fought alQaeda with bullets before you Americans were here Now I fight them with chickens" The plant played host to three Embassy war tourists . Unlike the minority who traveled out on the real business at the Green Zone, most people were rarely if ever if ever left the most people at the most important place at the US Embassy .

---  Iran8217s Green Movement is one year old this Sunday the anniversary of its first massive demonstrations in the streets of Tehran . A year later the country is more repressive and its hardliners are in a far stronger position8212and some of their success can be credited to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sanctions hawks in the Obama administration . Yesterday the UN Security Council on punishing Iran produced a weak much watereddown resolution targeting 40 companies which lacked the allimportant imprimatur of unanimity . Israel sent commandos against a peace flotilla in international waters and landed its men guns blazing on the deck of the USS Sanctions Sanctions Yesterday the U.S. Sanctions hawks pressed for a pyrrhic victory for those hawks who had pressed for 8220crippling8221 sanctions and likely to be counterproductive rather than effective in ending Iran's nuclear enrichment program . The U.N. Security Council voted 8220no8221 and Lebanon abstained and Turkey and Brazil voted in the resolution did not even seem to make the new sanctions obligatory It was at best a pithithithy victory for the hawks . The Israeli government liked what it was hearing Israeli PM Netanyahu even went on to praise the Green Movement fulsomely  2009 however with the masses no longer regularly in the streets representatives of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany met directly with a representative of Khamenei in Geneva . A potentially pathbreaking nuclear agreement was hammered out whereby Iran would ship the bulk of its alreadyproduced lowenriched uranium LEU to another country . In return Iran would receive enriched rods with which it could run its single small medical reactor producing isotopes for treating cancer . There is no evidence that Iran has such a capability or intention but the Security Council members agreed that safe was better than sorry . With Khamenei8217s representative back in Iran on October 2 the Iranians suddenly announced that they would take a timeout to study it . On May 15th Erdogan and Lula met with Ahmadinejad in Tehran and announced a nuclear deal that much resembled the one to which Iran had briefly agreed in October . Turkey would hold a majority of LEU in escrow in return for which Iran would received enriched rods . Iran had even now more LEU which meant Iran had by now more than now more enriched LEU than Iran had already produced more than more LEu which meant less LEU . Israel is the only country in the Middle East with an actual success success since the agreement

The reorganization will see the number of people more than halved while about the same number will be hired in St Petersburg from where many trading operations will be executed according to one of the sources who did not give more specific details about where the cuts would happen .

Russian state banks such as VTB and companies such as Rosneft have since scaled back their presence in the West while some of Putin's closest allies have sold their assets in the UK and its companies have since sold assets in Russia . The move comes at a time of rising tensions with the West  Of 30 financial experts polled by Reuters who rate Trump8217s other economic policies in glowing terms only a handful expressed even lukewarm support for the tariffs .

---  In announcing that the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement a global accord aimed at addressing climate change President Donald Trump made more than a few false and misleading claims . The Paris Agreement was reached on Dec 12 2015 and it builds on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and it was accepted by all but two of the 197 countries that were party to the convention . International environmental law experts say that that is not true Trump is wrong He said the US actually may be more exposed to lawsuits if it withdraws from the agreement . The process for withdrawal isn't easy and it will take nearly four years to complete the process meaning that the final decision would not happen until after the 2020 presidential election . There is no liability mechanism under the Paris agreement . There was language in the agreement about loss and damage from climate change but the accompanying decision text stated clearly that this does not provide a basis for liability or compensation for claims Ironically this text had been added to address US concerns . The final agreement which was added to addresses US concerns to address the US concerns was added by the World Resources Institute in Paris on Dec 24 2015 .

---  Teachers in redstate America are hard at work teaching us all a lesson . Insurgent teachers are instructing us all about a tale of denial for which we8217ve paid a heavy price . The American mythos has always rested on a belief that this country was born out of a kind of immaculate conception that the New World came into being and has forever after been preserved as a land without class hierarchies and conflicts that so disfigured Europe . School teachers however have always been workingclass stiffs for a long time they were alsoamp160 mainly womenamp160 who would have instantly recognized the insecurities struggles to get by and low public esteem that plague today8217s embattled teachers . The sight of teachers striking and sometimes even breaking the lawamp160 breaking the Lawamp160 to do so still has a remarkable ability to shock the rest of us Somehow it just doesn't fit the image still so strong of the mildmannered middleclass lawabiding professionals that public school teachers are supposed to be, says David Frum . He says . Frum. The American Mythos is a reminder that class has always mattered far more in our public and private lives than our origin story would allow . The Mythos has never been a classfree America  Deindustrialization of America has paid handsome dividends to financiers merger and acquisition speculators, junk bond traders and corporations fleeing a unionized work force for the sweated labor of the global South . In the process deindustrialization ravaged the economic and social landscape of workingclass communities including that of redstate teachers . Acquiescence and austerity breed cultural decline, blaming of teachers for profound social breakdown they largely bore the brunt and were not the cause of . Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders might be symptomatic of our moment of a pathological condition of a disease of the recovery from the disease of austerity and acquiescence .

---  North Korea has long practiced its state religion Kim Ilsongism . All three countries labeled 8220the Axis of Evil8221 by President Bush in 2002 are presently religious states . Kim Jongil was born on Mt Paektu the highest mountain in Korea and Manchuria long revered by Koreans as sacred and the birthplace of their nation in 1942 . The Dear Leader himself was born in 1941 in Vyatskoye in Siberia in the Soviet Union . The DPRK Constitution states 8220The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung is the sun of the nation and the lodestar of the reunification of the fatherland8221 A monumental artwork called the Figure of the Sun8221 erected to mark the 100day memorial service for Kim in 1994 adorns a hill overlooking Pyongyang in 1994 . North Korea is more than a personality cult It seems to me more akin to the State Shinto imposed on the Korean peninsula by the Japanese imperialists after 1905 . The Meijiera reformers who created Japan8217s state religion were welleducated men who probably didn’t believe the mythology literally but thought it would allow for the effective control of the indoctrinated masses It did in fact work fairly well up until Japan’s crushing defeat in 1945  Kim Ilsong chose 8220believing in the people as in heaven8221 as his motto . Heaven Tian alludes to a moral cosmic order that confers its mandate on successive dynasties of Chinese rulers . In a Tungusic myth the ancient Korean nation of Choson was founded by the son of a bear who had been transformed into a woman by Hwanung ruler of a divine city on Mt Paektu and a tiger . In the Japanese myth the grandson of the Sun Goddess descends to earth to a mountain peak in Kyushu marries the daughter of an earthly deity loses his immortality and begets two sons one of whom sires the first emperor Jinmu by a sea princess who turns out to be a dragon . The Japanese imperial family also came down from heaven and became human . The Korean Workers8217 Party continues to cultivate ties with more traditional perhaps more 8220legitimate MarxistLeninist parties including the Maoist Communist Party of the Philippines . Some material by Marx Engels and Lenin circulates in North Korea and the Marxist dictum 8220Religion is the opium of the masses8221 .

A powerful spring storm pummeled the US Midwest and Plains on Saturday with blizzard conditions and high winds while tornadoes and thunderstorms threatened some of the South . Forecasters were expecting more than a foot of snow 30 cm in parts of Michigan Minnesota and Wisconsin . Freezing rain and ice storms were expected to move into northern New England through Monday through Monday . The United States France and Britain launched 105 missiles overnight in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Syria a week ago targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities including a research and development center in Damascus . The U.S. President Donald Trump called the operation a success He proclaimed on Twitter his mission 8220Mission accomplished on Twitter . The US President George W Bush said the operation was "Mission accomplished" in 2003 to describe the same phrase as Bush whose use of the phrase in 2003 was widely ridiculed as  US Vice President Mike Pence seemed less sure of the use of sarin saying that Washington may well determine that it was used along with chlorine . Smoke was still rising from the remains of five destroyed buildings of the Syrian Scientific Research Center in Barzeh where a Syrian employee said medical components were developed There were no immediate reports of casualties . Syria released video of the wreckage of a bombedout research lab but also of Assad arriving at work as usual with the caption 8220Morning of resilience8221 Late on Saturday Syria time a large explosion was heard in a Syrian governmentcontrolled area in a rural region south of Aleppo . The Pentagon said there had been chemical weapons agents at one of the targets and that the strikes had significantly crippled Syria8217s ability to produce such weapons . Inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW were due to try to visit Douma on Saturday to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack . The last buses were due Saturday to transport out rebels and their families who agreed to surrender the town state TV reported That effectively ends all resistance in the suburbs of Damascus known as eastern Ghouta . The Western countries took precautions to avoid unexpected conflict with Russia before the strikes . Russia had promised to respond to any attack on its ally but the Pentagon said
---  This is Part Three of my previous commentaries regarding Iran8217s environmental problems . I8217ve attempted to transfer the technology known as 8220seawater greenhouse8221 to Iran for close to ten years . The inventor of the technology was in Tehran and during the four days he was here we drafted a contract and the detailed workings of the unpatented public domain technology was clearly explained to me and a team of very smart engineers and horticulturists that I had recruited . At the end of this article I will provide detailed information on how the technology works and how best to implement it in Iran . With this information made public it is now up to those in Iran to . implement it be it through private or public funding . Iran needs to realize that solving our environmental problems be it the water crisis eliminating air pollution shifting to all electric vehicles building solar farms producing biodegradable plastics are all job creating enterprises . This has been proven to be the case in America China Europe and India with the latter even having a Ministry of New and Renewable Energy that offers low interest microloans . Iran builds buses many companies make electric motors and we even have a manufacturing plant making lithium batteries so bringing these things together should not be that difficult right  A detailed explanation of how the seawater technology works and how it could maybe play a very significant role in solving Iran8217s water crisis . The heart of the technology is a honeycombed cardboard wall over which salt water constantly flows . Using existing wind conditions or through the use of solar powered fans the air on the other side where the plants are is greatly cooled and there is an increase of water vapor creating favorable growing conditions . These conditions substantially lower the amount of water the plants require and this water is supplied via drip irrigation connected to a reverse osmosis unit powered by solar panels . If the city of Tehran was to fully support such a plan Tehran could be pollution free within five years . All it requires is for the city to issue the necessary permits and the city would be given the necessary necessary permits . The plan would be totally dependent on the cooperation of the full cooperation of government organizations and most likely that the government organizations did fully support these plans with these plans . There are no sanctions that get in the way for implementing this plan . The technology still functions in terms of lowering temperatures and increasing water vapor content on other side of the sea water is yet to be fully tested and calibrated but has not yet been fully tested or calibrated .

---  On October 11 2011 the Obama Administration claimed that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard CorpsQods Force IRGCQF had attempted to kill Saudi Arabia8217s ambassador to the US . The story was so bizarre FBI Director Robert Mueller stated that it 8220reads like the pages of a Hollywood script . The comical nature of the case made it appear so implausible that President Obama became defensive when he was asked about the issue in a press conference on October 13 2011 . President Obama also gave a hint as to why the Department of Treasury was involved in dealing with the alleged terror plot and what the US intended to do about it He stated that we will 8220apply the toughest sanctions against Iran and continue to mobilize the international community to make sure that Iran is further and further isolated and that it pays a price for this kind of behavior8221 A more specific answer became a more specific one when David Cohen gave his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee . Cohen announced that the US is tightening the financial screws and deepening the financial screw against Iran in the Treasury is available against Iran . After this testimony Cohen said that the U.S. Treasury was intent to use the alleged Iranian Central Bank or Markazi bank to paralyze the Iranian economy since Markazi is the bank  The American Israel Public Affairs Committee AIPAC summarized the two resolutions on its website under 8220Stop Iran8217s Nuclear Program8221 and called for action . In late May and early June of 2008 two resolutions were introduced in the House and Senate calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the Iranian nuclear threat and to impose tougher sanctions on Tehran . The Bush Administration however realized that the rest of the world would not go along with sanctioning Iran's Central Bank of Iran . Instead the Administration relied on the Treasury Department to sanction major banks in Iran and prepare the ground for sanctioning Bank Markazi at some later date . The push to sanction Iran's central bank of Iran continued during the campaign season and just prior to the presidential election of 2008 Senator Charles Schumer pressed the Bush Administration to impose financial sanctions on Bank Markaz . In August 8 2011 the Wall Street Journal reported that more 8220than 90 US senators signed a letter to President Barack Obama pressing him to sanction the central bank with some threatening legislation to force the move . The letter as the report stated was cosponsored by Senators Mark Kirk and Charles Schumer . The move would represent a stark escalation in tensions between Iran and the two countries and would potentially freeze Iran out of the global financial system

---  On the third anniversary of the invasion of Iraq our newspapers and TV news were filled to the brim with retrospectives on the origins of the Iraq war . Bush administration officials misestimated the amount of resistance they would find in the wake of Baghdad8217s fall Donald Rumsfeld and his civilian officials in the Pentagon ignored military warnings and did not deploy sufficient soldiers to handle this initial resistance . As a result the occupation was unable to quell the rebellion when it was small This first blunder allowed what was at best a modest insurgency to grow to formidable proportions at which point occupation officials committed a second disastrous blunder dismantling the Iraqi army which otherwise could have been deployed to smash the rebellion . The claim that the war has an economic foundation may sound strange in the context of U.S. media coverage because it is so unfamiliar because of the unfamiliarity of American media coverage of the war is so foreign companies were forbidden from obtaining all protections for the market wide open in an immediate elimination of large multinational marketing companies . This resulted in the elimination of local commerce quickly threw out all local businesses like air and cell phone sales to the middle class of previously unobtainable goods like air phones and cell phones . The problem it turned out that the CPAinduced economic  Unemployment rates quickly exceeded 25 in many communities and today 8212 nationwide unemployment estimates range from a depressionlevel 30 to a staggering 60 depending on the source you consult . The economic debacle affected different parts of the country with differing degrees of severity . The protests were made more pronounced by the residual loyalty many Sunnis held for the Saddam regime and their greater sense of violation from the invasion . In 2003 the occupation response to protests was forceful almost gleeful repression . It was an unworkable policy in the face of a deepening disaster caused in the deepening disaster of a disaster caused caused by a deepening economic disaster caused by the US occupation . The Kurds were largely shielded from the economic destruction in effect their isolation from the Iraqi economy now insulated them as well from the neoliberal depression wrought by the U.S occupation . In effect the Kurds were insulated from the economy as well as the economic deportation destination of the neoliberal depression wrought by the economic dehumanization of Iraq . The US military response to the growing resistance rested only on only on the anger of a growing resistance rests only on growing resistance . In fact the US military responded by overwhelming often lethal military force and arresting people suspected of antioccupation attitudes or activities .

---  Charter schools are taxpayerfunded privately run schools freed from many of the rules that apply to traditional public schools . There are few hardandfast rules for how regulators charged with overseeing charter schools are supposed to do the job Many of these gatekeepers are woefully inexperienced underresourced and confused about their mission or compromised by conflicts of interest . Bad schools have been allowed to stay open and evade accountability . The National Association for Charter School Authorizers has worked to educate states and individual authorizers on what good oversight looks like while promoting measures such as 8220 default closure to help bypass authorizers that may be reluctant to close chronically underperforming schools . NACSA acknowledges there are promising signs that there are still a long way to go in the charter school system as some strong authorizers are good it's not how many are there any bad ones are good, but in the long term you can ignore the presence of bad ones, said Alex Medler the group8217s vice president of policy and policy and hope to strengthen accountability for bad ones . The Minnesota Department of Education is just starting a new charter school office that the state is revoking charterschool accountability in recent years . The state has made some tough calls to revoking some charters schools when it sees  Trine took on schools that other authorizers were poised to close . Authorizer hopping is a big problem said David Harris who spent five years as a charter regulator in Indiana . Grand Valley State University a public university in Michigan is one of the largest charterschool authorizers in the state . National Heritage Academies a powerful forprofit firm with 80 charter schools across nine states is a forprofit company with 80 schools in nine states . Some of these groups sell 8220support services to the very schools they regulate to make additional revenue on top of fees they charge the schools . The university has a large number of NHA schools in its portfolio for one reason only only 8211 performance8221 But academic performance has been mixed at the NHA charter schools under Grand Valley8217s watch with a few recognized for high or improved performance and twice as many flagged for having some of the highest achievement gaps . NHA has reported last year that regulators at Grand Valley are hooked at the company are hooked by the company . The school board members are convinced that Grand Valley National Heritage are hooked and that the board is not convinced that they are hooked on the company’s own joint joint joint venture with the company. The university says it is completely separate from the company
---  Opponents of President Vladimir Putin used graffiti on Thursday to take an ironic swipe at Russia over the nerve toxin attack on a former double agent . Graffiti sprayed on the pavement near the entrance to the Russian embassy and ambassadors residence in London . Britain and Russia have been trading public insults over the use of a Sovietera nerve agent called Novichok to strike down former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury . In response to the attack Britain has given 23 Russians who it said were spies working under diplomatic cover at the London embassy a week to leave .

They are emblems of all that is nongenuine and dispensable that was precisely what a target drone was just a dummy made to be shot down . The idea dates back quite a while there were the CurtissSperry aerial torpedo and the Kettering Bug at the end of World War I and then the Nazi V1s and V2s unleashed on London in 1944 . The metamorphosis came about almost chance between Kosovo and Afghanistan as the new millennium began As early as 1995 General Atomics had invented a remontrolled spy plane prototype prototype . Despite its new name the disquieting beast was not yet equipped with claws or teeth or teeth . The drone limited itself to illuminating itself to filming itself to film targets and limited itself . In Kosovo where it was deployed in 1999 it was not equipped with the drone .

---  London's response to Russia after a nerve agent attack on British soil is unlikely to trouble Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin unduly despite the expression of outrage that greeted it in Moscow . Russia's foreign ministry described May8217s measures as a flagrant provocation and promised a speedy response . Russia denied any involvement in the attack and simply declined to say anything about how a Sovietera nerve toxin ended up striking down a former double agent on the normally genteel streets of the English city of Salisbury . London has shown just how little power it is willing to exercise while every Kremlin opponent will be more nervous about retribution . France with its own business ties to Russia has been more muted on the issue of Russian involvement in attack on Skripal than Germany or the United States . London as one of the top two financial capitals in the world is a major beneficiary for the oligarchs and Russian officials who flaunt their wealth across Europe 8217s most luxurious destinations . London remains open to Russian investment albeit with a political chill but London as it is the Western capital of choice for oligarch and oligarchs .

Proposal calls for creation of a new commissioner post to oversee the issue backed by independent panel of experts . Volker Kauder head of the conservatives in parliament spoke in favor of the proposal given Germany's Nazi past and the murder of 6 million Jews during the Third Reich . AntiSemitism remains a hugely sensitive issue in Germany more than 70 years after the end of the Naziera Holocaust .

Lawmakers in the State Duma which is dominated by Kremlin loyalists said they had prepared the list ranging from food and alcohol to medicine and consulting services in response to Washington's move last week . It was not immediately clear if the draft legislation which would allow the government to impose the measures would become law in its current form or if it had the backing of the Kremlin . A Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was understandable that Russian lawmakers wanted to retaliate against the US measures . Russia imported 125 billion worth of US products in 2017 according to official customs data that included aircraft machinery pharmaceutical and chemical products . The draft legislation would give authorities the power to impose bans or restrictions in multiple areas of trade with the United States if they deemed that Washington was threatening Russia 8217s interests .

---  Martin Luther King Jr once applied for a permit to carry a concealed handgun . After King's house was bombed in 1956 the clergyman applied in Alabama for a concealed carry permit . Local police deemed him 8220unsuitable and denied his application . King would end up leaving the firearms at home . Some NRA members have tried to suggest that King should be remembered as a guntoting Republican in recent years . But this portrayal neglects to acknowledge how Republicans used conservative anger about Civil Rights advances to win over the Dixiecrat South to their side of the aisle . Ultimately King never embraced the complete pacifism of pacifism and he was moved by the experience of the Black Power years later in 1962 . In September 1962 when King was addressing a Nazi Party member James Roy the 24-year-old American Nazi Party . He jumped onto the stage and struck the face of a white man in the face and struck a Nazi member . King was struck onto the face with the face in the . face of James Roy Roy Roy the . Nazi Party in September 1962 . King maintained his resolve under conditions that would make many others falter and would make other people falter . He maintained under conditions he would make some other . Others falter under conditions under conditions  In holding up King as an icon of individual pacifism we fail to see his true genius . Moral nonviolence without strategic vision rings hollow . It is only when the tenets of unarmed direct action are strategically employed made into effective weapons of political persuasion through campaigns of widespread disruption and collective sacrifice that nonviolence gains its fullest power . Martin Luther King did embrace strategic nonviolence in its most robust and radical form8212 But it is important to remember that these came years after his initial baptism into political life in Montgomery and that they might easily not have happened at all The road to Birmingham followed the successful bus boycott King sought out ways to spread the Montgomery model throughout the South . The next major breakthroughs in civil rights activism would come not from the SCLC but through the student lunch counter sitins that swept through the South starting in Spring of 1960 and then through the 1961 Freedom Rides . King had chosen his time and place and taking the many approaches of this approach to taking the approach of taking the Birmingham tactics of nonviolent resistance tactics . In 1963 the Birmingham approach was taking many approaches to using the tactics of using the techniques of nonviolent direct action that had been used in the Birmingham and Selma .

---  Azure Farms a 2000acre organic farm in Oregon states it is under threat from the local Sherman County government . Sherman County officials are reinterpreting a law concerning the 8220control of noxious weeds8221 so it means 8220eradication8221 These weeds can be controlled on an organic farm but the only way they can be eliminated according to conventional 8220science8221 is by spraying . That means Roundup and other toxic chemicals that would decimate the organic nature of the farm That would decertify it as an organic . Further according to Azure Sherman County plans to put a lien on the farm forcing it to pay for the spraying . The deadline for expressing opposition is May 22 A better deadline is May 17 Here is the complete press release from Azure Farms and the ways to register your concern . Darren Smith Weekend Contributor to jonathanturleyorg has been covering this story He reached out and obtained a devastating letter from agricultural scientist Charles Benbrook Benbrook . Dr Benbrook has his critics within the conventional pesticide and GMO research community . The scientific community is responding to this overreaching government action by acting in the interests of health and responsible environmental stewardship through advocacy in the hopes that officials in Sherman County will reconsider their mandate  Sherman County plan to forcibly spray a 2000acre organic farm in the county is 'deeply misguided' The notion that Sherman County can eradicate noxious weeds by blanket herbicide spraying is deeply misguided . Over 120 million acres of cultivated cropland in the US is now infested with one or more glyphosateresistant weed for details see httpcehnhealthykidsorgherbicideuseresistantweeds.org . Sherman County proposal simply pushes the herbicide useresistant weed treadmill into high gear . Over the last 20 years excessive reliance on glyphosate or herbicides overall has created multiple new noxious weed . weeds posing serious economic environmental and public health threats . The majority of glyphosateresistant weeds are in the Southeast and Midwest where routine yearafteryear planting of Roundup Ready crops has led to heavy and continuous selection pressure on weed populations pressure that over threetosix years typically leads to the evolution of genetically resistant weed phenotypes that can then take off spreading across tens of millions of acres in just a few years .

---  Malcolm Gladwell's article is a procharter chapter from a pro-charter book . Gladwell advances the stereotype that lowincome US students will only succeed if they study as hyperindustrious Japanese and South Korean students do . The text is unsuitable to teach because of its omissions and its failure to answer key counterarguments even ones that Gladwell explicitly raises . I am a South Bronx public school teacher who is expected to teach my students that they must enroll in charter schools and leave 8220desultory8221 public schools such as ours if they wish to succeed I along with scores of other high school teachers . I do not dispute Gladwell8217s argument for providing more schooling or other means of enrichment to American children during summers and I don’t dispute it . The remainder of Gladwell’s piece describes the KIPP experience. Gladwell also lauds a typical KIPP Academy for completing so much schoolwork at extended KIPP work at six days at a school including extended schoolwork and homework requirements that she has little time to talk to her mother or mother to eat or talk to homework . There is no evidence that the reformers8217 actually believed in this crop analogy Gladwell actually believed that overstudy  Gladwell is engaging in a classically American sort of fearmongering by comparing US students to those of East Asia rather than Europe Canada and Australia . Success in elite schools correlates with conformity and conventional thinking . The US never beats Canada Australia or Western European countries in any category that reflects the overall quality of life of its people . Gladwell's dark secret 8211 that media elites will never reveal 8211 is that the US actually overachieves on standardized tests . We have fallen prey to the stereotype that we are ignorant and lazy and stupid, but anyone pretends to be shocked by this can go ahead and go ahead by this pretends that this is why it is so easy for writers as Gladwell to count and we will nod on cue . Tell us that the next moment that we should be the next one test scores should be in the Olympic Medal Medal Medal count. Tell us the next number one test score is the number one at the moment. We should be at the casino at the top of the Olympic medal count. We are exceptionally fat and stupid and readily agree that we will readily agree to agree with us. We will agree with Gladwell’s easy to agree. We’ll readily agree with anyone who’ve been told that
---  A long piece by Victor Davis Hanson that deals with the crisis in the Republican Party is even worse than it looks I'll share that with you in a minute here . He says it's kind of strange that we're worried about Armageddon being brought on by Trump when we8217re living the apocalypse of Obama and Clinton . This is something I think Trump supporters have already figured out and I think a lot of people instinctively have come across it or had it reflected in their minds as they ponder all of this It certainly spells it out for me In fact grab sound bite number five I was gonna skip past this because I couldn8217t find any reason for it to relate to anything other than me being discussed in the media but actually it now plays off of the VDH thing really well You will remember this because it plays off with the VH thing really . I asked 8220Where was all this during Obama Where8217s all this rage? Where is all this anger at stuff that actually is happening and has been happening for seven and a half years8221 We haven’t had any anger of the sort from the Republican establishment that’s being directed at Trump . And I'm not saying any of this from a proTrump position here I8217  Victor Davis Hanson says we8217re worried about Armageddon with Trump because Trump8217s clueless and Trump doesn8217t know anything and Trump is a neophyte . The outrage at Trump to me has always been out of proportion This fear this shouting of the dangers Trump represents is what the hell do you think we're living through is Anyway that's the point of VDH's long piece here at National Review . The author says we're worried that Armageddon is on the Trump horizon while we are living amid the apocalypse of Obama and Clinton . He says that all these people getting upset that Trump didn't know about the nuclear triad how about Obama not knowing how to pronounce 8220corpsmen8221 or thinking there are 57 states or riffing about those Austrianspeaking Austrians or perhaps of Hillary Clinton or the Falklands or the Maldives or the 57 states . VDH says all these flipflops on the minimum wage and tax increases on the rich are Trump's just rolling the dice as he goes Trump's cluelessness about the foreign policy choice in 2016 is more appalling than Obama's choice in the supposed foreignbery choice in foreign policy than anyone else where was the outrage at anybody else where were the outrage. anybody else .
---  Knesset has enacted a law that forbids Palestinian women in the occupied territories from joining their husbands in Israel . The freedom of love and marriage is one of the basic human rights . Denying to 14 million Israeli citizens solely because they are Arab is a severe violation of the international Bill of Rights that has been signed by Israel . Israel is a 8220Nation state of the Jews and therefore it has the right to do anything that serves Jews and harms nonJews even when they are Israeli citizens . But as usual with us 8220security8221 is serving here as camouflage for the real reason behind the prohibition . Behind the prohibition lurks the demographic demon a demon with a sinister power over the brains of Israelis that can twist their thoughts extinguish the last spark of decency and morality and turn quite normal human beings into monsters . The good of the individual has to give way to the common good8221 a respected professor said about the case of Sammy . The common good forbids allowing allowing allowing the Palestinian wife of Sammy to enter Israel which is the Jewish Nation State8221 . Many may feel that all citizens are equal before the Supreme Court says that Israel is equal to Israel . Many Israelis feel that way that is contrary to the contrary which says that Israeli legislation denies  The education system spends on an Arab child one fifth of what it spends on a Jewish one . Twice Israeli soldiers and policemen have shot at Arab demonstrators who are Israeli citizens killing several of them . Twice the police shot a Jewish demonstrator who was shooting at them from the roof of his home . Now everybody understands that a confrontation with the problem cannot be evaded anymore at the end of the 1948 war in which the state of Israel was founded only a small number of PalestinianArabs remained . The existence of a national minority of this size cannot be ignored It cannot be pretended anymore that the problem does not exist or that it can be solved and dismissed by some millions of shekels more Israel is facing a fateful decision which will determine the character of its relations with its Arab citizens but also the very character of the state itself . Israeli democracy is faced with a choice between two alternatives a A citizen8217s state in which all the citizens are equal irrespective of ethnic origin or religious faith or nationality . The state will be based solely on citizenship . There will be no difference between a Jewish Arab or Polynesian citizen . Relations between the individual and the state will not be based on citizenship but the state would be based purely on citizenship. The state is not concerned with ethnic origin

---  Barack Obama responded to recent controversy over his former pastor's controversial remarks . Obama called on all Americans to recognize that racial anger exists among both whites and blacks . He said that this anger and its causes must be fully acknowledged before further progress can be achieved . Obama identified the sources of racial resentment held by whites without being judgmental . He declared that bridging the very real racial divide of today is essential to forging the popular coalition necessary to transform America into a society with a universal and effective health care system an education system that serves poor and rich children and an economy that yields a decentpaying jobs for all . Obama was not playing the race card He was shooting the moon Obama delivered his speech in a stiff manner . The melodious lilt and cascading tones that typically characterize his campaign addresses were not present . He began with a predictable notion slavery was the original sin of the glorious American project of the American project. Obama identified with both the winners and losers of America 8220. He said: 'In no other country on Earth is my story even possible8221 He is E Pluribus Unum without being coy about it Obama declared that race has been an issue in the campaign. He was shot the moon. Obama delivered the speech in the  Obama declared references to race are unavoidable in assessing America8217s ills and needs . In assessing America 8217s needs Obama declared reference to race were unavoidable . Obama noted that all this history 8220helps explain the present wealth and income gap between blacks and whites . A similar anger exists within segments of the white community . Anger is not always productive indeed all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition and prevents the AfricanAmerican community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change . End the blame game game game in the end of the post-racial transformation end he argued black and white matters less important than black matters less than black issues and less than a black matter less. End the end. In the end, black issues should be less important and less important, Obama argued. His postracial transformation should end the post racial transformation end the end and less counterproductive and less harmful. His economic class and economic power should be counterproductive and more important. His racial issues of economic class should be so counterproductive and his economic class is less important. He argued black issues of black class and less powerful. His message is not just black and powerful. It is not about racism.
---  Capital and its states are usually able to respond with amazing speed to crises using them to consolidate power . But the phoenixlike ability of capital to rise from its own ashes has a limit which can be defined precisely as the revolutionary situation . The establishment has the resources and inclination to plan strategically 8212 in both public and covert fora 8212 it is no stretch to assume that it invests some resources in heading off the unrest that result from these limits . The Israeli state has been implementing a succession of strategies designed to make such an uprising extremely unlikely to succeed since the early 1990s . The Separation Wall and the settlement project to divide the West Bank East Jerusalem and Gaza into a series of walledoff heavily policed cantons has crippled the resistance capability of the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories . The Palestinian Authority and its attendant humanitarianaid economy tightly though not seamlessly integrated into the Israeli security state has severely compromised the integrity of parties unions and other formerly independent Palestinian political organizations . The U.N. aid and the NGOization which has gone along with it have severely compromised Palestinian political groups have severely compromise the integrity of parties unions . Despite these heavy setbacks the Occupies Territories are not completely quiescent Villages have mounted a patient intelligent  The protest movement offers an opportunity for the consolidation of a crossclass coalition including a contingent of young middleclass people facing the possibility of impoverishment and those who are already staring poverty and homelessness in the face . At its best and most dangerous it has the potential power to challenge the Israeli state But this challenge probably would not have the power to overthrow the state and local capital even if it could unite its forces within Israel Decades of neoliberal restructuring may have cut away most positive bases for identification with the state but Israelis are still wired to close ranks whenever a 8220security threat8221 looms . Segregation has become so entrenched that today Israeli Jews and Palestinians from the Occupied Territories have little opportunity to meet each other without the barrel of a gun intermediating and this segregation makes it almost impossible to build a unified or even a coordinated mass politics across the Green Line despite valiant efforts made by the Israeli and Palestinian Lefts . A significant bridge across the divide exists in the shape of the 12amp160million strong Palestinian community within Israel Though to a certain extent exempted from apartheid 8212 the links between Palestinian Israelis and their neighbors are also subject to severe restriction and surveillance .

---  In recent years we have seen a steady increase in antiLatino or antiimmigrant violence alongside a notable spike after September 11th in anti8220Arab8221 violence . Violence against Latino immigrants to be the fastest growing of all hate crimes fuelled by an atmosphere of linguisticracial hatred and permissiveness to violence against all those deemed to be from 8220elsewhere8221 In this rising tide of state and informal violence Arizona has come to be ground zero for the antiimmigrant movement . The ties between this formal antiimmigrant racism and the prisonindustrial complex are increasingly clear as INCITE recently revealed that the US government8217s antiimmigration enforcement budget had increased nearly tenfold since 1993 to 136 billion in 2008 . Repeal Coalition Coalici243n de Cambio has brought together members of groups like No More DeathsNo M225s Muertes and Bring the Ruckus and which 8220demands the repeal of all laws8212 that degrade and discriminate against undocumented individuals and that deny US citizens their lawful rights8221 . In 2008 Arizona border deaths on the Arizona border regularly account for half of all border deaths and 2008 is on pace to be a recordsetting year . No More deaths account for 50% of border deaths along the border deaths .  Repeal Coalition members have been canvassing Flagstaff8217s Latino community heavily for months in an effort to put the undocumented community in the drivers8217 seat of the coalition while building the organizational basis for further resistance and struggle As members put it each door has brought us closer to the reality and fear that undocumented and people of color are facing on a daily basis . Flagstaff residents recognized that they needed to respond more directly to the needs and desires of that community as a result the 8220sanctuary city8221 resolution has in practice served in practice as an organizing tool to build a community movement8221 The very next day Flagstaff was under full ICE assault doors were kicked in communitymembers were arrested and as tends to be the case in ICE raids families were torn apart . There are also reports that contradicting stated policy Flagstaff police aided ICE in gaining entry and even allegations that family members were detained as a sort of 8220ransom until the targets of arrest turn themselves in . There have also been more demand for community support reliable contacts that undocumented residents can call upon for groceries or supplies if they are too atrisk to leave their homes safely . The raids were only issued for overstaying visas and some were up to a decade old .

Obama is deliberately making people so upset What is driving him Anybody got any ideas I8217ve been watching the childrenashumanshields show that is now going on at the White House Boy these guys are somber Biden was very somber . I've got the 23 executive orders here There are 23 executive actions I got the PDFs earlier this morning They were embargoed until the president started speaking and a summary of these 23 as well It8217s called the Gun Violence Reduction Executive Actions You go through this and there isn8217t one of them that would have stopped what happened at the Sandy Hook Elementary School Not one of these would have been stopped this Not-one of these Would have stopped this You couple what the president talked about today with Governor Cuomo and what he did in New York Governor Cuomo has now told therapists that they gotta be on the lookout for strange behavior and they gotta analyze potentially dangerous behavior If they think somebody might use a gun in a dangerous way they gotta report that person And this has been ramrodded through  NRA ad calling the president a hypocrite by trying to deny parents the same thing he provides his kids with protection . Obama is out there saying 8220pundits8221 who frame this as an assault on liberty just want to gin things up to cause fear My friends I8217m here to tell you It's the president ginning things up It8217s the president creating unrest and fear and instability and I don8217t know why I mean I know the president's political leanings I know what his ideology is I know why and what about this country he doesn't like and wants to change I understand all that but I don't understand why he wants to get in people's faces and irritate them I don’t understand what drives him on that Now I can understand some underwearclad pajamaclad unhappy sniveling little liberal in the basement blogging about why he would want to make you mad because he’s miserable and he wants you to join him in it But the president is miserable. He said that 40 of gun purchases today are purchased by people whose backgrounds are not checked and he said this 70 of the American people and a majority of NRA members favor universal background checks .

---  Tim Kaine is a top contender to be Hillary Clinton8217s running mate . The 58-year-old Democratic US senator from Virginia is on a threeperson short list receiving full vetting according to the Associated Press . Kaine was born in St Paul Minnesota but grew up mainly in a suburb of Kansas City where he spent time after school working in his father's ironworking shop . Kaine bears a political resemblance to the candidate he might join on the Democratic ticket sharing a political pragmatism focused on inching policy along and eschewing grand gestures . He is a devout Catholic driven by the gospel of social justice and less concerned with the social issues that have become political wedges . Kaine has been branded as 8220a progressive who gets things done and has dedicated himself to incremental progress in a redturnedpurple state . The prospect of Kaine on the ticket has been met with hostility by some on the left wing many of whom are pining for Warren . Kaine is not temperamentally suited to satisfy liberals who want to see Donald Trump torn apart and his fellow billionaires demonized . Kaine isn’t temperamentally suitable to satisfy those who want Donald Trump’s fellow billionaire demonized Instead Kaine is the devout Catholic and speaks fluent Spanish8212  Kaine was gearing up to run for the top job from his first day as lieutenant governor . Kaine saw that the increasingly liberal cities in the state and the diverse collegeeducated suburbs in Northern Virginia offered a path for Democrats to win statewide elections without shying away from progressive views . Kaine was tapped to deliver the Democratic response to Bush's 2006 State of the Union speech less than a month after moving into the governor's office . Kaine built a new Democratic coalition of women and minorities that didn't need the voters from conservative rural areas a strategy that Barack Obama would replicate to win the state in 2008 and 2012 . Kaine came close to serving as Obama8217s vice president but was axed due to his little foreign policy experience but Obama wanted Kaine on his team Shortly after his election Obama recruited Kaine to oversee the Democratic National Committee . Kaine resigned his position at the DNC and entered the U.S. Senate seat in February 2011 to take over the Democratic Senate seat he had used a similar to the one he had had used during his gubernatorial campaign . Kaine is now running for the Senate . Kaine has run for a second term in the Senate after resigning from his position as a Democratic senator from the DNC in February 2010 to take on a running for a Senate seat .

The formerly freewheeling retailer began requiring suppliers to use a firm of its choosing to restock shelves and run promotions as first reported in the Washington Post earlier this year . The changes have caused heartburn for some small upstart brands as Whole Foods has begun to act like a more mainstream business . The company has worked for the last two years to streamline its processes across global and regional purchasing teams to ensure all its suppliers are supported under a consistent companywide set of protocols to ensure they support each other . Amazon is charging some suppliers the equivalent of 3 percent to 5 percent of sales to cover the cost of those broker services to cover its broker services . In addition Whole Foods

His parents immigrated from small towns near Guadalajara Mexico in 1986 and landed in this workingclass neighborhood and lived with relatives . The mayor of Chicago at the time Richard M Daley announced an initiative that would usher in a new wave of school reform It was called 8220Renaissance 20108221 and the goal was to open 100 new public schools in five years twothirds would be charters It would eventually close Jose8217s grammar school and create his high school The first school opened in 1999 when Jose was just eight years old after two CPS teachers had become convinced they could run a more successful school than the ones they worked in Noble . Noble was strict safe and had a singleminded focus about sending kids to college . The school was free from Chicago Public Schools bureaucracy and the teachers union Jose recalls his parents simply wanted him to go to college and saw Noble as a way to get him there Now Jose is now part of a new graduate program Noble created in partnership with the Relay Graduate School of Education which is taking a radical new approach to training teachers . He doesn8217t have a license or a degree in education  Noble leaders floated the idea of recruiting and training their own teachers . Mindy Sjoblom the former Dean of Instruction at Jose8217s high school and now the principal led the charge . She recruited Jose Garcia to be a teacher at Noble . He will have to wait a full year before getting his own classroom . Each one of the 16 people she recruited to teach at Noble will work under licensed teachers in other Noble schools .

---  In an era of rapidly expanding technology government and others are finding new ways to surreptitiously observe traffic and one day your own automobile license plate will probably become their accomplice by sending out a radio signal . Civil libertarians worry that in coming years more and more socalled radio frequency identification RFID data will be gathered from highways and streets as Americans take trips or go about their daily business . The notion of hightech plates is alive and thriving in California and elsewhere who are locked in a love affair with the potential of the technology . If present trends are borne out you will have a smart plate of some kind on your car in the next 10 years or so already smart plates are in use abroad and the US federal government has disclosed its interest in the possibility of having such an apparatus on motorcycles as well as cars and trucks . The author of SB 1453 state Sen Curren D Price Jr. argued California should not be late to the discussion of this emerging technology whether it is used for public service or commercial messages or if it is necessary for use on our roads . He countered the LA Times editorial on several points factual and otherwise and argued that there is 8216nothing as powerful as an idea whose time has come 8230 In effect he was  RFID technology has been in the wind internationally for a number of years and is of sharp interest to law enforcement and other governmental agencies in foreign countries as well as the US . RFID chips aren8217t in standard license plates in the US but the technology has a substantial presence on American thoroughfares It is now used in automated collection of highway or bridge tolls and for a variety of other trafficrelated purposes . The active RFID that is made possible by embedded microchips is a major advance over using optical character recognition to read license plates . In May Portugal found itself facing a privacypropelled outcry against a national law requiring that all vehicles have microchip license plates by July of next year RFID license plates to be made available by July 2015 . In recent days the leading US mountain resort company announced it is now using chips in chips in tickets and passes in a sophisticated system that tracks the runs of skiers at five Colorado and California resorts . In a news report from Auburn Calif last December described how a system works in that town of 13,000 . The cameras work in all weather conditions with infrared for night work They also can take pictures at high vehicular speeds and can take photographs at high traffic speeds .

The strike was symbolic at best as the Assad regime ran bombing missions from the same airfield the very next day . While 89 million is a rounding error in the Pentagon8217s 600 billion budget it represents real money for other agencies . Since 2001 the US had racked up 479 trillion in current and future costs from its wars in Iraq Afghanistan Pakistan and Syria as well as in the war at home being waged by the Department of Homeland Security .

The Veterans Administration has tripled since 2001 and yet the VA still can’8217t catch up with its backlog of cases or hire doctors and nurses fast enough to meet the need for care in a timely fashion . The biggest challenge the biggest challenge is the sheer volume of veterans generated by Washington’s recent wars and the flood of veterans they have already been awarded lifetime disability benefits . Imagine what a report might look like in 2032 if a president decides to continue to pursue neverending wars in  President Trump has pledged to offset sharp increase in Pentagon funding with corresponding cuts in domestic and State Department spending . Eliminated would also be 8 billion worth of block grants that provide services to lowincome communities including subsidies for seniors who can8217t afford to heat their homes . The biggest beneficiaries of Pentagon largesse will as always be the major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin which received more than 36 billion in defenserelated contracts in fiscal 2015 . The top 100 defense contractors received 175 billion from the Pentagon in fiscal year 2015 nearly onethird of the Department of Defense8217s entire budget . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the construction costs alone of such an effort would be 800 billion over the next three decades at an annual cost of 266 billion which is 40 higher than the Navy's present shipbuilding budget .

---  Transition is a sustainability movement that has spread to 1105 towns in 43 countries over the past eight years . The movement is more about shifting paradigms than prescribing solutions . The seed for Transition came in 2004 when Rob Hopkins encountered the concept of peak oil the theory that easytoreach oil will run out at a specific date . It would be a mistake to think that becoming a Transition Town means setting off on a clearcut path to energy independence . Transition Town is a social experiment on a massive scale but it is a sine qua non however it is the belief that communities must become more resilient in the face of three catastrophic threats peak oil global warming, global warming and economic instability . Kinsale, England declared the first official Transition Town in 2006 offers perhaps the most fully realized example of Transition in 2006 . The mayor backed by the mayor is perhaps the first Transition Town . The town with a population of nearly 30,000 residents is perhaps most fully-planned energy usage in 2030. The town boasts nearly 30-years-worth of green buildings with a green buildings officer and a horseandcart taxi taxi . The city boasts nearly 400 residents of nearly 7400 residents of 7400 people of 7,400 . The Transition Town has nearly 30  In parts of Europe Transition has had to respond to the pressing needs of communities decimated by the ongoing Eurozone crisis . In Brazil Transition primarily fosters social enterprise projects it has given birth to a community bakery and a business turning old advertising banners into bags . In the United States there have been 139 Transition Towns and 200 unofficial 8220mullers8221 have sprouted Transition has also taken its own distinct path Most of the Transition towns have popped up in places one might expect relatively moneyed green hippie enclaves like Boulder Colo the first official US Transition Town . None have taken root so far in any conservative strongholds although there are a number of urban initiatives in Boston Houston Los Angeles and Cleveland to name a few . Chicago has launched numerous projects such as ecofriendly overhauls of city buses and a park modeled on New York City . More than 1060 mayors have signed the US Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement a pledge to meet the goal of the Kyoto Protocol the U.S. climate protection Agreement . The United States was one of only four countries not to join to reduce carbon emissions below 1990 levels .

Some say the group a selfdescribed adhoc coalition of activists that 8220seeks to end the LGBT movement ended up doing little more than angering and alienating people who should be their allies . Others say the loudest denunciations seemed to come from cis white gay men who were mad because their party got delayed . No arrests were made though some No Justice protesters say they were kicked and spit on The parade was significantly delayed and eventually was re-routed There was a strong presence of DC Metro Police at the site of the protest No Arrest was made No Justice no arrests . The group plans a 8220debrief and forum on Friday June 23 Look for the group on Facebook for details for details on June 23 look for details at nojusticenopride.org and for a full list of their demands can be found at noJusticenpride.com/no-pride-parade/org .

Accounts of exactly what happened how the protest was handled and who exactly was behind it differ based on whom you ask . Emmelia Talarico a No Justice No Pride senior organizer said she had no knowledge of who that group was . She also denied other rumors circulating this week that some of the protesters at the Saturday parade were paid . A lot of this is coming from fissures that have been boiling beneath the surface for decades, said a longtime DCbased trans activist who runs Casa Ruby a local LGBT community center .

---  Bob Moses was a field secretary for SNCC and one of the main organizers of the Mississippi Freedom Summer project during the 60s . Bob Moses says the project was "an earned insurgency" Bob Moses: We ran what I think of now as an earned insurgency . We had to earn the respect of farmers and sharecroppers that we were working with . We earned the right to call on the whole country to come take a look at itself in Mississippi . We were asking people to risk their lives so we had to show them we were actually also willing to do that ourselves right . And the Justice Department was not going to interfere around something other than voter registration . We also had to be disciplined ourselves to work on the voter registration so that every time we got arrested there was the presumption that thats what we were arrested for right. We were disciplined ourselves . We spent every night leaving McCombzie . Louis Allen is a witness to Herbert Lees murder and Amandzie came down every week leaving a week leaving the McCombz . The Justice Department is now debating debating should we should we have a summer project and debating debating the Civil Rights Act right in the middle of the winter of 63 . This is now in the mid-winter of 63. And  Mickey Schwerner was part of a small group of people that decided we were not going to live in this country unless we could change it Right So it was much my choice I felt I was in as much of a position as those people we were working with JAY So tell us more about the summer MOSES Well so when Louis Allen is murdered I go back and I throw my weight in for the summer project cause when Herbert Lee was murdered all we could do was commit ourselves . And so we then move through SNCC and CORE and some of the NAACP chapters and gather what in the end came to be 600 to 700 young mostly white college students teachers doctors and lawyers . The first ideas of setting up community health clinics got its start in the context of Mississippi Freedom Summer . The whole state of Mississippi was in this paranoia that they were somehow going to be invaded right And they had their tanks and guns I mean it was like they were going to go to war in a real shootout right JAY Invaded by MOSes Invading by Moses . Mos. But what Im getting at is clearly youre risking your life Youre getting knocked down and standing back up Mos . And where did they come from Mos
---  Marco Rubio responded to President Obama's State of the Union address on behalf of his fellow Republicans . Rubio: America is exceptional because we believe that every life at every stage is precious and that everyone everywhere has a Godgiven right to go as far as their talents and hard work will take them Like most Americans for me this ideal is personal . The opportunity to make it to the middle class or beyond no matter where you start out in life it isnt bestowed on us from Washington It comes from a vibrant free economy where people can risk their own money to open a business . President Obama believes its the cause of our problems that the economic downturn happened because our government didnt tax enough spend enough and control enough And therefore as you heard tonight his solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more borrow more and spend more . More government isnt going to help you get ahead Its going to hold you back and create uncertainty. More government breeds complicated rules and laws that a small business cant afford to follow . Rubio opposes your plans because I oppose your plans to protect the rich because I want to protect your middle class . He accuses us of wanting to save Social Security and Medicare and Social Security . He even criticized us for refusing to raise taxes to delay military cuts cuts  Economic growth is the best way to help the middle class . If we can get the economy to grow at just 4 percent a year it would create millions of middle class jobs . The President should abandon his obsession with raising taxes and instead work with us to achieve real growth in our economy . We must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws, but unconstitutionally undermining the 2nd Amendment rights of lawabiding Americans is not the way to do it On foreign policy America continues to be indispensable to the goal of global prosperity and safeguarding human rights and safeguarded liberty . The world is a better place when America is the strongest nation on earth, but we cant remain the strongest on earth But we don't have an economy that can't afford to remain powerful if we don’t remain powerful. The President laid out false choices like the ones the government is just out of business or big government or the ones laid out . We need to stop the President laying out false choice between big government and big business or business, but the President is just a good choice between government or big business . We have been playing a good game of playing of playing . Of course we face other challenges as well as a good

The classification and naming of brown bears which include grizzly bears as well has gotten embrangled with this evolution of theory and methods informing taxonomic deliberations . Brown bears exhibit a substantial amount of morphological variation driven by diet rather than evolutionary descent or corresponding variation of the genome . The same genetic stock can give rise to enormous uniformlybrown coastal bears and diminutive blond arctic grizzlies each with distinctly different skulls yet they are of the same approximate lineage with the same biogeographic history of the bears all living on Kodiak Island and the rest of the rest .

Clade 3 is dominant everywhere else with subClade 3b predominant in the interior of North America . The subspecific variants have been robust to the vagaries of method primarily because their taxonomicallyrelevant morphological features are distinctive enough to have arisen from distinguishable genetic differences .

---  US President Donald Trump made a surprising threat on Friday to veto Congress8217 newly passed 13 trillion spending bill . The move raised the specter of a government shutdown ahead of a midnight deadline to renew funding for federal agencies . A senior House aide said there were no plans to call lawmakers back for a special session all but guaranteeing there would be a shutdown unless Trump backed down from his threat . The White House aides were caught by surprise by the veto threat and had no immediate explanation for what prompted it . The threat marks the third consecutive month of government funding snafus as Congress has not turned over funding to make good on his campaign promise to build a wall along the USMexico border . Trump also has been at odds with Democrats in Congress over the fate of Dreamer immigrants those brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children . The bill includes 16 billion for six months of work on the project although he had sought 25 billion for it to build the project . The government shut down for three days in January as lawmakers fought over immigration and three days as Congress fought over the issue in January . In February there was an hourslong shutdown when a Republican lawmaker delayed a funding bill to protest a hike in the US deficit in February . The Republican Speaker Paul Ryan  President Emmanuel Macron said the incident appeared to be a terrorist attack and security forces were securing the area . President said the man had demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam the prime surviving suspect in the Islamic State attacks that killed 130 people in Paris in 2015 . Collomb said France is part of a USled coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and has thousands of soldiers in West Africa fighting al Qaedalinked militants . The 28member EU collectively condemned the attack and declared in a Brussels summit statement that it was 8220highly likely8221 Moscow was responsible . European Union member states agreed at a summit on Friday to take additional punitive measures against Russia for a nerve agent attack in Britain as Moscow accused the bloc of joining a Londondondriven hate campaign against it .

But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said evidence of Russian culpability presented by British Prime Minister Theresa May is 8220very solidly based8221 and promised new measures after EU leaders agreed late on Thursday to recall their ambassador to Moscow . The Czech Republic and three Baltic states Latvia Estonia and Lithuania were among those expulsions of Russian diplomats from their capitals . However Boris Boysov
---  President Barack Obama put on hold the much anticipated US attack against Syria . Obama thereby brought to a screeching halt a process extending back over six decades in which successive inhabitants of the Oval Office had arrogated to themselves or had thrust upon them ever wider prerogatives in deciding when and against whom the U.S. should wage war . The Federalist Society should offer Obama an honorary lifetime membership, writes Ahmed Asad . Asad: Obama is a constitutional lawyer of course and it8217s pleasant to imagine that he acted out of due regard for what Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution plainly states namely that 8220the Congress shall have power8230 amp160to declare war8221 to declare war . He says Obama was saying to Congress I8217m keen to launch a war of choice. But first I want you guys to okay it. Now in effect Obama is saying I8218m keen on launching a war, he wants to launch an 8220 shot across the bow8221 of the Syrian ship of state, he says. Now he wants Congress to OK it. Obama's invitation qualifies as beyond unusual and the president8218 . For example, the Arab League refused to allow US forces to allow its airspace access to Syria airspace .  Obama has implicitly opened the door for a Great Debate regarding the trajectory of US policy in the Middle East . The Senate and House of Representatives will likely be voting to approve or reject some version of an Authorization for the Use of Military Force AUMF at stake is much more than the question of what to do about Syria .

Despite troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan dropping sharply the Obama administration has still managed to spend more on the Pentagon than the Bush administration did during its two terms in office . The entrenched power of the arms lobby and its allies in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill makes it harder for members of Congress to consider cutting or slowing down even a failed or failing program . The strategic placement of arms production facilities and military bases in key states and congressional districts has created an economic dependency that has saved many a flawed weapons system from being unceremoniously dumped in the trash bin of history .

The overwhelming consensus in favor of a 8220cover the globe8221 military strategy has been broken from time to time by popular resistance to the idea of using war as a central tool of foreign policy is broken by resistance to use war as an alternative to foreign policy in foreign policy . The public is almost entirely on our own  The next major challenge to armed exceptionalism and to the further militarization of foreign policy came after the disastrous Vietnam War which drove many Americans to question the wisdom of a policy of permanent global interventionism .

Snowden has been working at the National Security Agency for the last four years . Snowden will go down in history as one of Americas most consequential whistleblowers alongside Daniel Ellsberg and Bradley Manning . The Guardian after several days of interviews read the full transcript of Edward Snowden’s identity at his request . Snowden is deeply worried about being spied on and has watched television and monitored the internet hearing all the threats and vows of prosecution emanating from Washington . He said he has no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong He said Snowden will be made to suffer for my actions but I will be satisfied if the federation of secret law unequal pardon and irresistible executive powers that rule the world that I love are revealed even for an instant . The Chinese government might whisk him away for questioning or he might end up being grabbed and bundled into a plane for questioning viewing him as a useful source of useful information . Snowden said he could be rendered up being seized and bundled in a plane bound for U.S. territory for questioning .

The golden age of the Jews8221 in America has passed its zenith, writes Richard Aaehr . He laments that with an intermarriage rate around 50 and a fertility rate of 16 children per Jewish woman Jews are committing population suicide8221 He takes a swipe at liberal American Jews most of them supporters of legal abortion . As Jews decline in number he points with a quivering finger at the Arab and Muslim population in America heading in the other direction he points at the Muslim population of America . He says that in the 2004 campaign four Jews gave over 80 million to Democratic political funds to the Democratic Party . In the history of giving a few individuals has not happened before this level of political political money of never happened before the countryIsrael is not a political issue but a few of them have given a few in the past . Baeh cites two academic studies putting the US Muslim population at between 18 and 29 million two thirds the size of the Jewish community . He also points out that the . total ArabMuslim community is about 35 million with the total Arab  There is good news and bad news about the decline of Jewish and proIsrael influence and the rise of ArabMuslim influence in the American political system are greatly exaggerated .

---  Five Afghans who returned home on the same flight as alJazeera journalist Sami alHaj and the other three prisoners described in my previous article the future is disturbingly uncertain . For the five Afghans who were released from Guant225namo they were not freed outright as was the case with the 152 other Afghans previously released but were instead transferred to Block D a wing of PoliCharki Kabul8217s main prison . In common with previous Afghan releases the identities of the five men have been difficult to establish The Pentagon never discloses the names of those it frees and although lawyers representing the prisoners are informed of their clients the identities remain unknown unless the media are present on their arrival which has not happened in Afghanistan for many years or until further investigation by lawyers or journalists turn up details of their identities . As with those described above their stories reveal yet again the wholesale mockery of justice that defines the regime at Guant225nomo remain unknown . Haji Rohullah Wakil is the most significant is 46year old Haji . Wakil a celebrated antiTaliban commander in Kunar province whose opposition to the Taliban was such that he fired the first salvo against the Taliban in October 2001 after the USled invasion in Afghanistan after the invasion in October  Sabar Lal who was finally freed from PoliCharki in February had no doubt that he had been betrayed by the Taliban . At Guant225namo he explained to his tribunal the injustice of imprisoning him with members of the Taliban at the hands of US forces . The story of the second Afghan Abdullah Mohammed Khan a 36year old ethnic Uzbek shifts the focus from Afghanistan to Pakistan and appears to be another example of dubious intelligence on the part of the Pakistani and American authorities . Khan denied knowing anything about any connection that Musa might have had with alQaeda saying that all he knew was that he came to Pakistan from Turkey with his family for medical treatment on his feet which were 8220in very bad condition8221 He also denied knowing about a CD containing explosivesmaking manuals that was apparently discovered in Musa8217s house . No attempt was made to verify whether or not they were true . No one has ever established the identities of the other 59 men who were falsely accused of the others who were accused of having links to alQaeda . Despite this both Farouq Saif and Mohammed alTumani remain in total against 60 prisoners in total in total of 60 prisoners who have been accused of spreading false allegations against 60 men in total .

The Tennessee Republican claims he wasn't privy to any inside information leading up to the sale of his stock in Hospital Corporation of America HCA weeks before the company reported lower than expected earnings July 13 that sent the stock south . The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the matter a spokesman for the senator said last week to determine if Frist broke any laws . Frist had attempted to have it both ways since he created his socalled blind trust in the 1990s being intimately involved with his investments that directly conflict with his political work as a senator and then claiming that he was totally unaware of his personal financial investments because it8217s in a blind trust . The mainstream media quick to accept Frist's statements that he had been in the dark about his HCA holdings was complicit in allowing the obvious conflict of having a senator who makes national decisions on healthcare that directly benefit the senator's fortunes and that of his family fall off the radar screen . In fact Frist knew of these sales or at least had access to information that these sales took place . The income from these sales of HCA stock was reported on his annual financial disclosure statements that Frist filed with the Secretary of the Senate  Senator Bill Frist has 89 percent of his assets tied up in HCA stock .

The Justice Department ended a 10year probe into how HCA defrauded the federal government and agreed to a 631 million settlement in the largest fraud settlement in US history . HCA paid 17 billion fines to keep one Frist out of jail making it the largest US fraud settlement ever . In February Frist instructed the trust administrator to unload his shares of his trust to sell his shares by the truckload prompting shareholders to raise questions on HCA boards to raise concerns about the company .

---  The New International Version of the Bible is by far the most preferred translation of the Scripture according to a new survey of US evangelical leaders . More than 65 percent of the participating leaders named the NIV as their preferred Bible in a survey conducted by the National Association of Evangelicals NAE . New Bible translations face large competition to gain a foothold in churches and homes but once established they have long staying power commented Leith Anderson president of the NAE which claims to represent 30 million evangelicals . The church failed to stand for the word of God It surrendered really without much of a fight and this is at the root why the church is so powerless today I found it very easy to memorize the KJB and spent a great deal of time memorizing the word during the late 1970s . The word is not in the heart Thy word Thy word has hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee against thee, says the pastor of a large church and I had an ugly confrontation with an assistant of a pastor who said he tells me he tells everyone to use any translation but he says he never heard anything about this revolution from the pastors I had contact with the pastors and said he was shocked to see a different translation .

The next revision of the Bible will be like Satan knew he could not gut the gutting the Bible as it would be too obvious so in the first edition so in one edition so many key verses and words that weaken faith will be deleted later the NIV is even politically correct and there will be even worse as there will even be even there to the next edition as there is no gender neutral and there is even a gender neutral edition .

---  Since the 1990s the U.S. has transferred large quantities of military materiel ranging from trucks and aircraft to machinegun parts and millions of rounds of live ammunition to Bahrain8217s security forces . The Pentagon has recently proven more powerful than American democratic ideals more powerful even than the president of the United States . A TomDispatch analysis of Defense Department documents indicates that the Pentagon and those oilrich nations have pressured the White House to help subvert the popular democratic will sweeping across the greater Middle East . The relationship represented by that bullet or so many others like it between Bahrain a tiny country of mostly Shia Muslim citizens ruled by a Sunni king and the Pentagon has proven more . than American democracy ideals . The US supplied Bahrain with enough 50 caliber rounds8212used in sniper rifles and machine guns8212to kill every Bahraini in the kingdom four times over .

The Pentagon in coordination with the State Department oversaw Bahrain’s purchase of more than 386 million in defense items and services from 2007 to 2009 the last three years on record These deals included the purchase of a wide range of items from vehicles to weapons systems .

The six Gulf nations along with regional partner Jordan are set to spend 70 billion on weaponry and equipment this year and as much as 80 billion per year by 2015 . The Pentagon is also the sole conduit through which its Arab partners in the Gulf can buy the most advanced weaponry on Earth by acting as a gobetween the Pentagon can ensure that the weapons manufacturers it relies on will be financially sound well into the future . Human Rights Watch reportedly strongarmed the White House by playing on fears that Iran might benefit if Bahrain embraced democracy and that as a result the entire region might become destabilized in ways inimical to US powerprojection policies . The White House has begun a review of its military assistance to the Bahrain regime . The British government suspended exports of any military equipment to Bahrain while France suspended its military exports while the UK suspended exports while France has suspended any military exports to the kingdom . The United States is however already deeply involved in the Bahraini uprising and has given a box of doughnuts to the other Gulf nations and given a lot of its own doughnuts .

Bush has done a clever job of manipulating the mass media but in reality his smooth imagery and downhome personality are severely undermining America8217s values . Bush does not seem to understand that while it is not a sin to be born to privilege it is a sin for spending your life defending it . Bush's economic policy which determines social policy is much like the iceberg waiting in the path of a steaming Titanic . The Bush tax and budget cuts were not made in order to jumpstart the economy or balance the budget they were simply massive cash transfers . Social programs are being slashed to pay for the war in Iraq tax giveaways for the wealthy and new defense contracts for arms makers who just happen to be big Republican campaign contributors . The administration has not provided the American people with a strategic vision as to how the War in Iraq and this excessive and bloated arms buildup fits into our larger defense antiterrorist and foreign policy . We have lost our moral compass as well as our national security and public institutions as a consequence of what is significant in both Iraq and foreign policies have suffered As a consequence as a result of the Bush administration has failed to understand the consequences in terms of human lives and

---  Nearly three out of every five parolees in Illinois are without work8212 with even higher rates of joblessness on Chicago8217s predominantly black South and West sides . More than half of all exoffenders in the state wind up back behind bars within three years of release . Employment is the most important factor in keeping exfelons from returning to prison but advocates say employers are still just too scared to hire them . Federal government incentives like tax credits for companies that take chances on excons have failed to drum up excitement . More common are employers who turn to criminal background checks to filter out such workers from the start . The number of background checks performed by state police hit at a 20year high this year this year state police has conducted 707544 checks the most it began performing them in 1984 and is rising so far this far this year . The retail industry has hired about 6600 workers in Chicago area which employs about 66000 workers in the Chicago area has hired around 6600 people in recent years . Ex-employees are more motivated and better overall temporary employees than the average of 30,000 people in the city of Chicago area . Exoffenders have never caused a major problem but none have ever caused a problem with employee theft .  Up to 5000 in federal bonding insurance to cover any losses incurred from hiring exoffenders . Just 14 of the policies were issued statewide in fiscal year 2004 which ended June 30 Advocates say increasing the benefits and programs may be one of the only ways to increase participation . Training the wouldbe workers themselves however remains a critical part of all major exoffender employment programs in Chicago . Exoffenders learn how to search the Internet for jobs prepare resumes and dress for interviews they coach them extensively on answering the one application question many of them dread the most 8220Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Safer Foundation says it instructs them to come clean 8220 Truth is the only way to get employers to hire them but getting our people to stay there That's an issue in itself. The first 30 days are the most critical time for nearly half of Safer's clients who are still with those same employers 30 days later . Most employers aren't tolerant of those who are not tolerant of workers who are repeatedly late or repeatedly calling their supervisors repeatedly asking them to show up for work without informing their supervisors or inform their supervisors for work . Most of the workers who have found better wages or don't have to call their supervisors without telling their supervisors about their supervisors .
---  Tuesday8217s announcement of the ObamaGeithner recovery plan is basically an extension of the BushPaulson plan . Smaller less troubled banks will be bought out by the large 8220troubled8221 ones to the personal financial benefit of their stockholders . Wall Street Journal oped page has provided enough hints trickling out for the past three months to tip the hand of Wall Street . Financial elites the problem is that it is not possible to inflate another bubble from today 8217s debt levels widespread negative equity and stillhigh level of real estate stock and bond prices . Financial power elite would love to recover The problem for them is how to start a new new bubble and make yet another new fortune and make another fortune yet the alternative would be to keep what they have taken and run and run. Discussions about emergency loans can improve on Citibank and Creditors have focused on putting enough emergency bailouts in place in place to improve on the emergency lending lending . The world is the real estate bubble, As I said above it was a golden age The financial and real estate and financial world and the financial and financial bubble is the global real estate . The real estate is the financial power elite . We are approaching Russian kleptocratic  Wall Street the banks and the other financial vehicles enrich the wealthiest 1 per cent and indeed the richest 10 per cent of the population . The first trick is to preserve the wealth of the creditor class 8211 Wall Street . Next comes an 8220aggregator8221 bank that sounds like 8220alligator8221 from the swamps of toxic waste to buy the bad debts and put them in a public agency . The harder part is to revive opportunities for creditors to make a new killing And it's the economy that8217s being killed Here I imagine how I imagine the plan might work . The government will swap 8220cash for trash for trash in exchange for the 500000 mortgage that is going bad heading toward only a 250000 market price . The PPP institution will start with say 3 trillion in funds and will have the power to buy and renegotiate the mortgages that have passed into the hands of the government and other holders . It will be financed with private funds 8211 in fact with the funds now being given to recapitalize America 8217s banks headed by the Wall St banks that have done so poorly .

---  Christopher Everard offers some answers to questions about a muchmaligned and often misunderstood Royal Family . The Queen uses the Christmas Day broadcast to make us think she is wholly British and a Christian . Her actual family come from Saxony and Bavaria and more of her ancestors are German than British . Her Christmas Day speech usually includes references to British religious landmarks such as this year's Reconciliation8221 . Her name is not 8216Windsor8217 but the royal family were known as the Dukes Kings and Queens of 8220SaxeCoburgGotha8221 In a time of brutal war with Germany the queen8217s grandparents and greatgrandparents created a fake name which they use to this day 8216WINDSOR8217 . Her money comes in the form of TAXES which are earned from millions of people and she also earns millions each year from her private estate which is centred on the county of Lancaster THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER . The queen hires and fires the head of the BBC and several other prominent jobs in Britain . Her family's financial affairs are forbidden from public discussion and she can recall and dissolve parliament whenever she likes . Her cousin is DAVID CAMERON and there are strong Germanic  Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs earned Her Majesty8217s Revenue 163660 billion pounds last year . Much of that tax comes from the People 8211 not Corporations 8211 who are often able to shutdown their parent company after three years and start trading under a slightly different name . This of course makes a mockery of the unwritten law that the wealthier of people in society contribute tax revenue in order to help the disabled ampamp elderly . Workers however on the PAYE system cannot take legal advantage of tax havens and have the indignation of a large portion of their salary being taxedstolen at source with not a jot of thanks from the Inland Revenue . Three of the Duke of Edinburgh's four sisters had married German princes three of whom became leading Nazis . The sinister Nazi connections come from three of the . sisters 8211 and that means that they were financing the killing machine which bred the killing machines which bred a 8216master race 8211 . The queen's immediate intermarried family plotted and conducted bombing raids and reduced the areas where poor people lived into rubble and wasteland . It was the queen8217's relatives who waged war on the people 8211 the POOR PEOPLE . She announced in her Christmas broadcast that she had been murdered or ordered the torture and execution

SAGE provides dental care free no cost to the patient at all in underprivileged underserved areas . Veterans dont get any dental care from the VA unless theyre 100 disabled . Medicaid covers some dental but only pretty much emergency stuff . They will cover a regular cleaning but they wont cover whats called a deep cleaning if you have gum disease or other cavities that arent hurting them right now but they will not cover that so either the patient or the patient has to pay for it . The mouth is obviously part of the rest of the body If you have infection and disease in your mouth then you have infections in the other parts of your body things like diabetes go up if you've gum disease heart disease go up . If you're two to three times plus more more likely to have diabetes you have diabetes . The same bacteria is the same plaque clogs your arteries and causes a heart attack or a stroke If the vessel goes to your brain it'll cause a heart itll cause a stroke if it goes to the brain it will cause a stoke If it goes into your heart it can lead to a stroke  SAGE is near the Mexico border and treats undocumented immigrants for free no questions asked . The organization is a nonprofit organization treating these people without having any coverage and not having to pay anything . A lot of them are scared to come out sometimes and go to a dentist or healthcare provider because they think they might be deported just by seeing a healthcare professional or by making themselves known. Theyre in a lot of fear very scared AARON MAT201: Weve already seen over 3000 patients. Im seeing these patients after hours and on the weekends of my private offices because SAGE does not have its own building yet I own two private offices . I think there should be a lobby that can effectively organize the needs of your patients who can say your needs and can say what needs your patients to say. I think patients should have accurate and appropriate representation because we have no insurance companies which are taking extra money which they end up taking up extra money to take up a kind of extra money and then they don’t have extra insurance companies. I’ve put everything in the same kind of money that they take up extra extra money. Ive put all of the extra money in the insurance industry’s not really taking up a lot extra money but the insurance companies

---  The world8217s leading oil producers were expected to bring fresh discipline to the chaotic petroleum market and spark a return to high prices . But far from restoring the old oil order the meetingamp160 ended in discord driving prices down again and revealing deep cracks in the ranks of global energy producers . The Doha debacle will perpetuate the low oil prices that have plagued the industry for the past two years forcing smaller firms into bankruptcy and erasing hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in new production capacity . It may also have obliterated any future prospects for cooperation between OPEC and nonOPEC producers in regulating the market . The failure of a November meeting has been widely attributedamp160to the Saudis8217 desire to kill off new output elsewhere8212and to restore their historic dominance of the global oil market . Saudi Arabia is now looking capable of weathering any price downturn than its rosy prediction is grimmer as the Saudi royals begin cutting back on any price cuts and finding themselves themselves .

The Saudis were also seeking to punish regional rivals Iran and Russia for their support of the Assad regime in  The Saudis rejected the draft agreement it had helped negotiate in Doha and the assembly ended in disarray . Most analysts have suggested that the Saudi royals simply considered punishing Iran more importantamp160 than raising oil prices . With the proposed agreement in tatters Saudi Arabia is now expected to boost its own output ensuring that prices will remain bargainbasement low and so deprive Iran of any windfall from its expected increase in exports . The kingdom is expected to immediately raise production from its current 102 million barrels per day to 115 million barrels and could add another million barrels in the next six to nine months . With Iranian and Iraqi oil heading for market in larger quantities that8217s the definition of oversupply it might also wound the kingdom in a major way if not fatally . The Saudi intervention has in fact failed to achieve its intended objectives though it has produced thousands of civilian casualties provoking UN officials and creating space for the al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . The prince seems determined to keep the conflict going and to counter Iranian influence across the region . For Prince Mohammed the oil market has evidently become just another arena for this ongoing struggle for this . For the Saudis the oil industry is being fundamentally transformed altering relationships among the major producers and eroding their inclination to cooperate .

---  Ralph Nader offers nothing but a protest vote for the candidacy of George Bush and for continued war at home and abroad . Nader stands for everything that a progressive voter could want in 2004 is to vote for Nader . The left made a mistake in 1992 with the election of Bill Clinton and went about our business figuring that we had a Democrat in the White House and so all would be well but he turned around and screwed us . The idea here is that by withdrawing our votes from the sellout Democrats and casting them for a genuine progressive alternative we force the Democratic Party to shift its position more to the left on a variety of issues . The problems with this approach are twofold and there is no mechanism for transforming the next presidential election is four years away and there are no mechanisms for the pressure of a third party to transform the party into a leftward swing vote in the 2004 election . If anything Nader created a toxic reaction to Bush to the same reaction can be expected in 2008, it might be expected to be even worse in 2008 and it might even be argued that another Nader vote could be argued for another 23 percent around Nader’s vote for Bush in 2008 . The same reaction is expected in 2004 could be expected only in 2008  The courts the election system and debates the media are rigged to keep third parties on the fringe . The likelihood of a third party fracturing into ineffective factions and selfdestruction before it could become a significant electoral force is almost 100 percent . John Kerry is belatedly going about trying to win that support of the antiwar movement . The only way we can see talk converted into actions will be if Kerry replaces Bush and we push him to do the right thing in office . We should face no power to influence this president and we should face that George Bush is no longer trying to influence the president . We never really pushed Clinton. We believed his blather or we were just too lazy or selfinvolved to challenge him and gave him a pass when he stiffed us . We must push him when he stepped down when he was in office. We have no influence to this president. We had no ability to influence George Bush. We need to try to influence his policies and we had no influence trying to change his change in education and change his education bill etc. George Nixon certainly certainly not trying to try and try to change Nixon. He certainly certainly is no trying and not trying trying and tried to change Richard Nixon’s change in his rush to war
---  Each was asked these questions: What do you consider to be the top two issues in the city of Rio Rancho and how would you address them . What qualities or experiences make you a better candidate to represent the city than your opponents . What should the city do to spur economic growth and attract new employers? How do you envision being a fulltime mayor? Here are their responses: R Morgan Braden, Gregg Hull, Carrie Davene, Carrie Carrie Dzezon, Carrie Hull and Kristopher Allen Kaylene . Gregg Hull: I will listen to our citizens who have a vested interest in our great city. I will have regular office hours where citizens can get hold of me I will attend city board meetings and assist our city council members and city manager with direction and fresh ideas to our city not the old and unproductive way that we have had in the past. I have had successes and failures and have learned from both I have a passion to make Rio Rancha the best place in New Mexico to live work and raise a family. I am personally opposed to raising any of our taxes. We need to work actively recruiting businesses both large and small Start by working with the state economic development board to keep up with companies interested in our area  Jim Owen is the only candidate for mayor that has not been mayor or run for public office so I bring a fresh new perspective to the office of mayor . The number one issue for Rio Rancho is our lack of economic growth . In order to provide the city services required to maintain and improve our quality of life we must increase our gross receipts tax revenue . The mayor is just part of the governing body and he needs to have the support and respect of the city council . I sold my business over a year ago and with no other distractions I am able to dedicate my full attention to this community . I have the proven relationships needed to engage and convince successful business organizations to come to the city . The city has the reputation for being the safest city in New Mexico but there is always room for improvement If we expand our gross revenue we will be able to properly equip and retain our public safety personnel without increasing tax increases without increasing taxes . I will work fulltime with the community and city council to implement jobcreator tax incentives . I would support an effective longterm bonding plan that provides for defined goals and completed projects optimizing the investment of the taxpayers . I am used to putting in long hours to achieve objectives and be successful as mayor. I have never embarrassed this city
---  Todays Powers That Be economic political and media are wrongly forcing a regime of austerity on our nation . Theyre insisting that we hoi polloi must downsize our middleclass dreams claiming that America no longer has the wherewithal to do big things . Far from shrinking down we have the economic strength today to be spreading the middle class and advancing the historic egalitarian ideals that were planted at Americas founding . In Washington on Wall Street and in the corporate suites the elites have taken exquisite care of themselves with theamp160 top one percent tripling their share of the nations wealth since 1980 . The massive redistribution of wealth is not an issue of economics but of basic morality in basic morality In plain words its robbery . In this country of unsurpassed wealth its an abomination that the power elites are casually tolerating poverty pay as our wage floor. Nearly four million Americans are being paid at or below the desiccated federal minimum wage of 725 an hour For a single mother with two kids thats 4000 a year beneath the poverty level . In most places even if youre single with no childrentry stretching that over the basics of rent utilities and utilities . Imagine that they can actually juxtapose the words working and poor without blinking much less blushing or barfing  The one simple step that would immediately add juice to the consumer economy which accounts for twothirds of Americas economic activity is to do the one thing that boneheaded lawmakers adamantly refuse even to consider . Raising the legal minimum wage to 10 an hour would elevate 30 million hardworking Americans now paid a poverty or nearpovertylevel income . The most important consideration in raising the wage floor the man from Bain Capital explained in a March interview is to keep America competitive by which he means Keep profits of speculative profiteers like him like Bain Capital high So that would tell you Professor Romney instructed that right now theres probably not a need to raise the minimum wage Unless of course youre a minimumwage family or the American economy . Mitt is merely mouthing the preposterous and perverse corporate line that lifting the minimum would hurt lowincome workers, says the prince of private equity Mitt Romney . In terms of what 10 buys this would lift the value of minimum wage only to what it was back in 1968 when worker productivity was only half of what it is todayamp160 Here is not a minimum wage . The percolateup solution would provide a huge and direct lift out of our present doldrums for those 30million hardhit people would .
---  In a blow to manufacturers Monsanto Co and BASF SE Arkansas state lawmakers voted on Friday to bar sprayings of a controversial weed killer after midApril to protect farmers from potential crop damage . The ban makes it less attractive for farmers to buy soybean and cotton seeds that Monsanto engineered to resist dicamba because the crops are designed to be sprayed with the chemical during the summer growing season . The United States faced an agricultural crisis last year caused by new formulations of herbicides . Farmers and weed experts said the products evaporated and drifted away from where they were applied hurting crops that could not resist them . Monsanto is banking on its dicambabased herbicide and soybean seeds engineered to tolerate it called Xtend to dominate soybean production in the United States the world8217s secondlargest exporter .

---  The eagerly awaited judgment in Writ Petition No50 of 1998 was delivered by the Supreme Court of India on August 09 2012 . The background of this petition has already been explained in detail in the piece titledamp160 The Orphans of Bhopalamp160that was published recently inamp160CounterPunch 1amp160 . The Scientific Commission submitted its report to the Central Government in July 1987 while the Commission was denied extension and was disbanded immediately thereafter the Report was not made public until about a decade later . Unfortunately the wellconsidered recommendations made in the8220Final Report on Medical Relief and Rehabilitation of Bhopsal Gas Victims were ignored by the Court at that time . However it is significant that after an avoidable gap of twentyfour years most of the recommendation made by DrSadgopal and DrDas in their Final Report have been accepted by the court in its verdict on the present writ petition . Most of the recommendations have been taken to task for its final Report have now been accepted in the verdict .

---  House members and the White House made seemingly contradictory claims concerning the Federal Drug Administration8217s blood donation policy for gay and bisexual men . Days after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando House members said the FDA's oneyear deferral policy or celibacy for men who have sex with men is based in fear and stigma not science . The White House said that the current policy does 8220rely on scientific advice rather than scientific advice . The FDA changed its original 1985 policy from a ban on any man who has had sex with another man since 1977 to a one year deferral . The revised policy also defers blood donations from a woman who has sex with anamp160MSMamp160for one year The FDA cites high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus or HIV in the MSM population as support for its oneyear deferredral policy . The CDC and AIDSgov also note that unprotected anal sex is the riskiest type of sex for HIV transmission in part because of the biology of the rectum . The U.N. explains that the term includes sexual acts between men who don8217t identify as gay or bisexual men in the United Nations as a sexual preference or sexual acts . Australia changed its policy between 1996 and 2000 .  The FDA is concerned with HIV transmission from MSM donors during the socalled 8220 window period when current tests often can8217t detect the virus in blood . The FDA says the rate of partner infidelity in ostensibly monogamous heterosexual couples and samesex male couples is estimated to be about 258221 The FDA also cites a condom failure rate of roughly 1 to 2 percent per episode of anal sex . Conversely many proponents of the individualamp160risk assessment for MSM blood donations argue MSM in monogamous relationships are at low risk for HIV transmission . We reached out to the FDA for clarification but have yet to hear back If we do receive a response we will update this article accordingly . In fact these advancements in HIV testing and other factors have reduced the risk of HIV transmission via blood transfusion from about 1 to 2500 to 1 to 1 million to 1, 2500 million in revised revised HIV transfusion to the revised revised blood donor testing since the 1980s in New York University and Columbia University respectively do address the FDA's proposed one proposed one-year deferral policy for MSM Blood Donor policy do not address the proposed one year deferral for HIV . We weren't able to independently verify infidelity rates in monogam monogamous samessex couples and heterosexual couples .

US officials are asking China to cut tariffs on imported cars allow foreign majority ownership of financial services firms and buy more USmade semiconductors in negotiations to avoid plans to slap tariffs on a host of Chinese goods and a potential trade war . US stocks surged on Monday on the news that the two sides were talking after a massive rout last week when Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on up to 60 billion of Chinese imports over alleged misappropriation of US intellectual property . China said it would treat foreign and domestic firms equally equally would not force force force not force domestic firms to transfer technology and strengthen intellectual property rights to strengthen its own technology and buy USmade products . US President Donald Trump and Chinas President Xi  A train believed to be carrying a senior North Korean delegation left the Chinese capital on Tuesday following a dramatic whirlwind visit that some reports said included the country8217s leader Kim Jong Un . The unconfirmed visit comes ahead of planned summit meetings with South Korean President Moon Jaein and US President Donald Trump . The White House has demanded that China cut its 375 billion trade surplus with the United States by 100 billion . China has a 25 percent tariff on US cars and has talked recently of lowering it while Trump has often complained that the US import tariff on passenger vehicles is only 25 percent China imports of USbuilt motor vehicles totaled 106 billion in 2017 about 8 percent of the country 8217s overall US imports by value according to US government data . China imported 26 billion of semiconductors from the U.S. semiconductor imports last year . It is unclear how US chips would replace South Korean and Taiwanese chips since there is minimal overlap between US chips and those of the two Asian producers . The United States accounted for just 1 percent of China’s total semiconductor imports . China can increase the regulatory burden on US companies through new inspections and rules ban travel ban travel stop providing export licenses of key intermediate goods . China could also inflict pain on US multinationals such as Apple
---  The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether chipmaker Broadcomamp160Ltd engaged in anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with customers . The investigation comes as Broadcom pursues a hostile takeover of Qualcomm in a 103 billion deal . Since the FTC would likely review any merger for anticompetition practices the current probe could make regulatory approval more challenging . ZTE has been banned from selling components to leading Chinese telecom equipment makeramp160ZTE Corp for seven years for violating the terms of a sanctions violation case US officials said on Monday . The ban is the result of ZTEs failure to comply with an agreement with the US government after it pleaded guilty last year in federal court in Texas to conspiring to violate US sanctions by illegally shipping US goods and technology to Iran . The Chinese company which sells smartphones in the United States paid 890 million in fines and penalties with an additional penalty of 300 million that could be imposed . US companies cannot export prohibited goods such as chip sets directly to ZTE or via another country beginning immediately . American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment which includes networking gear and smartphones and smartphones . The US action first reported by Reuters could be devastating to the ZTE since American companies  US chipmaker Qualcomm QCOMO will refile as early as Monday an application with the Chinese government to clear its 44 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors NXPIO sources said . Qualcomm withdrew its earlier antitrust application on Saturday at the request of Chinas commerce ministry just days before the regulators April 17 deadline to decide on the transaction expires expires . Analysts said a decision by Mofcom on the deal is unlikely to come before trade and investment tensions between China and the United States are resolved . Qualcomm has already received approval from eight of nine required global regulators to finalize the acquisition with Chinese clearance the only one pending . Qualcomm declined to comment but said the deal was unfounded and not related to the deal .

---  There are 175 million international migrants in the world each year . 175 million humans represents roughly 3 of humanity . The biggest concentration 561 million is located in Europe the second largest 497 million in Asia and only the third largest 408 million in North America . The modern nomad is moved about more concretely by the forces unleashed by the world capitalist system and not by some invisible hands . The colonial colonial 8216tendency8217 is still alive and kicking people8217s doors down just as shamelessly as was done in the good old times of the Romans and the Pharaohs . To this mass of humanity being thrust about the globe annually in search for jobs safety food shelter or food shelter humanity can still afford or cares to offer we must add the massive historical human displacements due to modernity8217 . To all of this a final footnote has to be added the covert interventions in the life of other nations something which the sedentary citizens of the First World nations are on average far more comfortable with than are the citizens of The Third World . These interventions produce nomads of various stripes from complete innocents all the way to the spooks . The Western world is moved around the globe by forces far more complex than those moving the traditional nomads  Traditional nomads the latter could easily be considered the happier of the two . This is not to say that nomadic tribes are fundamentally free from contradictions or incapable of violence . Violence is far less structurally necessary among the traditional nomads especially as they are situated in and surrounded by modernity today . The modern nomad by contrast has a better objective position to discern the arbitrary nature of the given rules of seeing through to the heart of the instability of the system the very instability that his modern sedentary cousins may take for 8216the creative powers of capital8217 and therefore mistake for the zenith of stability incarnate . Such was the dilemma for Pol Pot The answer to our modern riddle cannot be that simplistic. The real liberating questions cannot pose a false choice between capitalism in its different forms and adapting some precapitalist method in organizing modern life with all its complexities Such was Pol Pot . The truly liberating questions can't pose afalse choice between Capitalism in its various forms and adapts some precapsitalist methods in organizing Modern life with the complexities such as Pol Pot. Or is this a false question? To this man and millions like him both of all age groups of all ages of all genders and all race groups of both genders

---  The Great Law of Peace protects independence and individual liberty while bases decisionmaking on consensus rather rule rather than rule . Gandhi recognized this as the power of peace and applied it to create nonviolent civil disobedience that led to India8217s independence from British rule . The same force of peace that guided Gandhi to fight against the oppression of Britain was present at the beginning of the United States . Peace is a revolutionary force that largely remains untapped How can social movements be created by this innate transformative power and bring harmony to this divided world? We must overcome this loathing toward different views and work together to overcome this hatred that seeks to separate us. Peace is the foundation of America's radical acceptance of differences that recognizes all equally in uniqueness and accepts differences that recognize differences in uniqueness of the people we disagree with or condemn . Peace means to be at peace with one, even the opinions and viewpoints of those we disagree or condemn, says Frederick Douglass in his famous speech for the Fourth of the July 4th of the American Independence Declaration of Independence .

The problem is that the tariffs could wind up hurting those and other workers as well as American consumers instead . It would also add fuel to the fire in an already existing trade war . Trump adheres to the isolationist posture and dogma have already caused US allies and adversaries to seek tighter relationships with each other from a currency and trade agreement perspective . The latest tariffs are an element of diplomacy which could be better used toward diplomacy . The tariffs could be truly used toward the diplomacy toward diplomacy toward our borders and toward the goals of our borders around the world around the borders and our enemies of our enemies . The world was equally incensed by the world of anger from China and its foreign ministry called the tariffs  Trump's ongoing temper tantrums are a chip at the wall of international diplomacy . Pe241a Nieto canceled his trip to the US the second time he has done so due to the wall dispute Trump declared he would impose the tariffs . Canada provides 16 percent of US imported steel, Brazil and South Korea rank second and third . 75 percent of our northern friend's total steel exports go to the U. The tariff would cripple one of Canada8217s leading exports while we are trying to negotiate the 8220best8221 NAFTA deal with them . But that is exactly what Trump wants by dangling financial threats and then taking them away he elevates himself to being more of a dictator and less of a leader of the country8217 . The US has been behind in infrastructure surrounding the steel industry one of the reasons US steel mills have been at over not under capacity . The reality is that there needs to be better infrastructure . The Trade Deficit of tariffs as a means to control trade deficits comes after his first year in office which the US used to use a trade deficit to control its trade deficits . The trade deficit widened in the first year of his office office office which was a record high in the office of his first office of the office which used a record .

---  Lawmakers were not notified of the Guantanamo detainees8217 transfer until after it occurred . Law requires the defense secretary to notify relevant congressional committees at least 30 days before making any transfers of prisoners to explain the reason and to provide assurances that those released would not be in a position to reengage in activities that could threaten the United States or its interests . Obama issued a signing statement contending that the notification requirement was an unconstitutional infringement on his powers as commander in chief and therefore could override it . The administration determined that given these unique and exigent circumstances such a transfer should go forward notwithstanding the notice requirement . The White House simply chose to ignore the law because King Barack I does not 8220obey8221 laws . The only possible reactions to this story are uncritical applause for everything the Administration did to secure Bergdahl8217s release or wishing that he8217d been left in Afghanistan to rot or wishing he was left in captivity to rot . The Taliban commander claimed he stumbled to his car in the wild and claimed a drunken drunken car in one of the videos that was taken during his captivity during his capture was a lie and that he had a drunken lie and said he had no intention of giving the White House a chance to stop him  President Obama illegally struck a prisoner swap deal with the Taliban in order to get back one dubious prisoner . Five highranking Taliban commanders were captured and held by Haqqani network of the Taliban . One of the freed men was the head of Taliban8217s army . Another arranged for alQaeda trainers to visit Afghanistan . Another has been implicated by the United Nations for killing thousands of Shiite Muslims . President Karzai is now even more distrustful of US intentions in the country . The faster they 8220mysteriously8221 reappear back in Afghanistan the more complete the humiliation of Barack Obama will be . It is important to note that the Haqqanis are heavily tied to Al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban are not the same thing as the Pakistani InterServices InterServices ISI . The Afghan Taliban have their own distinct and separate leadership council or the InterServices Intelligence agency also known as the ISI . It also provides safe passage and support for Al Qaeda . The Taliban are also known for providing safe passage to the Al Qaeda safe passages and providing safe passages to the Taliban with safe passage. The Taliban and the Taliban are very different from the Taliban. They are not different from each of the two groups. They have their separate and distinct leadership councils. The Haqq
---  Federal District Court Judge Royce C Lamberth was assigned to Cobell v Norton nine years ago . Judge Lambth was nominated to the federal bench by Ronald Reagan and had a long background as a government lawyer including a stint trying field courtsmartial in Vietnam for the Pentagon . Since the case8217s earliest days he has consistently sided with the plaintiffs and refused to hide his anger at Interior . The government has asked that the judge be removed from the case . The Justice Department commented that his ruling from July 12 2005 8220is unlike any other judicial opinion that we have ever seen . Whether or not the judge's vehemence has finally caught up to him remains to be seen but you can judge his words for yourself what follows is a sampling of Judge Lamberh at his blistering best . The judge has grown increasingly frustrated even questioning the power of his own seat in the face of hostility from the government he made a career representing . The federal government is not content to have Lamberthy has asked for the judge to be removed . The plaintiffs are worse off today than they were six years ago when the judge is asked to leave the case. The judge is on the ropes. The government is worse off now than they are six years  The appropriations provisions at issue in this matter appear to represent yet another attempt by defendants to evade the rule of law by any means available to them no matter how duplicitous or underhanded They also serve to demonstrate defendants8217 manifest hypocrisy . Defendants have indignantly charged that the Court was undermining the constitutional separation of powers . Interior has failed to recognize a crucial fact about the IIM trust fund that the fund is not the government8217s money It belongs to the beneficiaries . The fund is supposed to be administered in their best interest and not simply in a manner that is most convenient to the government . The idea that Interior would either instruct or allow BIA to withhold trust payments and then to stonewall the Indians who dared to ask why is an obscenity that harkens back to the darkest days of U.S.Indian relations . The Court is offended that the individuals responsible for these acts would cite the Court 8217s Orders as justification but the perniciousness and irresponsibility demonstrated by these acts is shocking at the bottom of the truth at all but the most credulous individuals realize that they are being duped and stop playing for the sake of the Indians . The case is nearly a decade old and nearly a .

Conservation groups support increased logging to fund rehabilitation of past present and future logging impacts . The BDP is based upon false premises and is justified by flawed science faulty economics and deceptive ecological accounting . The plan proposes logging up to 730000 acres of the BDNF in exchange for timber industry support of 570000 acres new wilderness areas . The proposal is a tripling of logging over what the Forest Service originally determined as suitable for timber cutting in its forest plan but also involves potential entry into 200000 acres of roadless lands . The West Pioneers gaining only a small core proposed as wilderness in this plan is essentially the highest steepest rocks and ice country like the West Big Hole with heavily forested roadless areas with gentle terrain read good for logging such as the West Pioneerers gaining just a small part of the forested wilderness . The BDNF forests consist of higher elevation forest types like lodgepole pine subalpine fir aspen and other species that are naturally dominated by mixed to high intensity blazes that occur at long intervals in long intervals . In other words these forests don8217t burn frequently but when they do the fires tend to be large and intense  There is a growing body of anecdotal and scientific evidence to suggest that thinning or fuels managementby whatever euphemism logging is called does not slow or reduce the likelihood of large blazes . Fires spread quickest and burn hottest under conditions of drought wind and high temperatures . Logging is more propaganda and propaganda from the timber industry than the industry .

---  The city of San Francisco filed a lawsuit against US Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday asking a federal court to overturn his December decision to revoke legal guidance designed to protect minorities the indigent and disabled . The city attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement that his lawsuit focuses on six of the 25 different legal memos that Sessions rescinded and accused the Trump administration of 8220trying to gut protections for the poor people of color and people with disabilities under the guise of regulatory reform8221 A spokesman for Sessions did not have any immediate comment on the lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California . The lawsuit challenges the decision to rescind the memos under the arcane Administrative Procedure Act or APA which governs the process the federal government must follow when drafting new regulations . In December 2017 Sessions announced he was doing away with legal guidance that he deemed to be 8220unnecessary inconsistent with existing law or otherwise improper8221 One such document for instance gave guidance on how state and local governments should accommodate disabled employees and integrate them into the work place in order to protect them from discrimination and comply with a Supreme Court decision related to the Americans with Disabilities Act .

---  In 194647 British and American leaders invented an imminent Soviet threat to invade Western Europe . President Harry Truman and his coterie transformed Uncle Joe into Stalin the Butcher . In 2002 George W Bush and his mountebank advisers invented the imminent Iraq peril Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had alleged links to Al Qaeda terrorists and would launch weapons of mass destruction he had secretly accumulated . In the post World War II years US leaders repeated implausible charges that the Soviet Union constituted a . clear and present danger8221 Poised to attack Western Europe the Soviets also aimed to subvert democracy everywhere These statements became the 8220factual8221 basis for the Cold War . Cold War origins should serve as a warning for the present prewar situation with Iraq . The Bushies apparently feel loathe to support their claims with facts perhaps because they have none. They also count on temporal atrophy to prevail in the public mind and count on temporarily atrophy to prevail in public mind . The missing links in the Administration8217s argument are facts. In 1983 Ronald Reagan selected the perfect right wing as his emissary to Iraq in 1983 . In 1983 Donald Rumsfeld provided Iraq with military assistance in the name of an Iranian victory . According to court records that Washington wanted  President Reagan sent secret message to Saddam Hussein telling him that Iraq should step up its air war and bombing of Iran . Reagan and Bush knew that Saddam had used chemical weapons and cluster bombs and acquiesced 8220in order to stave off the Iranian attacks8221 The US assisted in facilitating sales of such weapons to Iraq says Teicher . Today Rumsfeld8217s apparent amnesia about his 1980s mission as Reagan8217's conciliator allows him to convert into appalling crimes the very acts that he encouraged Saddam to commit 8220 . Today the world has acquiesced in Saddam Hussein 8217s aggression abuses and defiance for more than a decade8221 What a change from 15 years earlier dealing with the same man and the same regime he dealt with 15 years ago dealing with Saddam 15 years before dealing with same man, says Rummy in the 1980s said Rumsfield in the 80s and the 90s . In 1990 after meeting with US Ambassador April Glaspie Saddam not adroit in discerning nuance assumed he had a US green light to invade Kuwait he assumed he was planning to recapture only the northeastern tip of Kuwait but so the modern demonization campaign began Saddam took the whole enchilada and so Saddam gained himself the
---  Jens Soltenberg and Angelina Jolie assert that 8220NATO has the responsibility and opportunity to be a leading protector of women8217s rights . The pairing of a NATO bureaucrat and a famous movie actress may at first glance appear odd However this partnership has been long in the making . The two vowed to identify 8220ways in which NATO can strengthen its contribution to women's protection and participation in all aspects of conflictprevention and resolution8221 The pair vowed to find ways to strengthen NATO's contribution to gender equality . Jolie is a goodwill ambassador of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR and in that capacity wanders around the world berating the world for not doing enough to address humanitarian crises . She sneered at the UN Security Council permanent members that stood in the way of intervention against humanitarian intervention . The countries blocked the last effort to resolve this peacefully have potentially resolved this peacefully, calling the vetoes a shameful and shameful effort to have potentially have blood spilled on their hands . The UN has a responsibility to take up their power to take action whenever our organization proves it is powerless to be powerless to take a decision to take responsibility to protect women's rights and the future. The UN proves it pays the price of peace  Jolie is the glamorous face of NATO8217s revamped PR campaign . She can be relied on to echo the military alliance's selfjustifying rationales for its favored solution to any problem namely the threat to use force . In April 2014 Jolie and William Hague jointly launched a campaign called Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative . Hague was of course British foreign secretary during NATO's 2011 Libyan bombing campaign . Thousands of women lost their lives as a direct result of NATO and Hague's humanitarian bombs . NATO destroyed government law and public order institutions that before its intervention had protected the women of Libya from sexual crimes including sexual crimes . NATO helped deliver perhaps millions of women into the hands of ISIS . In June 2014 Hague and Jolie cohosted in London a grand threeday Global Summit to End Sexual Violence. Participants included Secretary of State John Kerry and UN SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon . The summit cost 16352 million to host The food bill alone was more than 163299000 while total expenditure on taxis hotels and transport reached 163576000 Jolie declared We need to shatter that culture of impunity and make justice the norm not the exception for these crimes. We need political will to fund proper protection to fund to go after the worst perpetrators and the proper protection

Less than a week after the bailout the country's currency the real was on the move again . The loan and the need for one have led to a more insidious admission in the world's financial press It holds that market liberalism has failed in emerging countries . A popular backlash is brewing against the free market and against those who have been prancing about as free market democrats only to be pushing the interests of oligarchs on stage right . The population's ire starts from their own capitals for good reason it stretches all the way to WashingtonNew York and OttawaToronto .

The type of democracy of the kind has turned to a fabled fabled democracy has turned a fables.

Most 8220democracies8221 have long banished the possibility for rule longer than two terms . The elite press laments its defaulting to no end in the developing world . Populism does rule it does not borrow the red banner to engrave its mark in its mark erasing its mark . But France is caught between the abstentionvoting and muting of social democracy by rightistvoting by rightristvoting, muting populism by rightism by rightwardwardism by populism by Rightistism . The West is not the invention for the West as it is a source of the invention of Communards as a political invention for Western democracies as a source for the Western democratic society . But it is like mathematical democrats like to recall and endaining in mathematical democracy as mathematical democracy to recall its privilege of abstaining in electoral politics even counts less than sex
---  German conglomerate Bayer won EU antitrust approval on Wednesday for its 625 billion buy of US peer Monsanto . The tieup is set to create a company with control of more than a quarter of the world8217s seed and pesticides market . Both deals secured EU approval only after the companies offered substantial asset sales to boost rivals . Environmental and farming groups have opposed all three deals worried about their power and their advantage in digital farming data which can tell farmers how and when to till sow spray fertilize and pick crops based on algorithms . China has given conditional approval to the Bayer and Monsanto deal which has won a green light in Brazil . Australia said on Thursday it would not oppose the deal following the divestment commitment . The US Justice Department which is also reviewing the merger said in a statement on its website that it would press on with its review and that the market in the two regions was quite different . The deal is due to rule on the BASF deal by April 16 and is currently being reviewed by Russian antitrust authorities too . China's launch of crude oil futures futures futures to be launched on Monday will be a major step in Beijing but for western traders it will likely bring frustration as opportunity as well as opportunity for Western traders it is likely to bring frustration to western traders .  The contract risks having to play catchup each morning to the moods and swings of Europe and America rather than setting its own price . Senior futures traders said Chinese trading habits may also be a shock to foreign users . China offers the potential for a deep liquid market buoyed by an explosion of interest from momandpop investors that has supported its vast commodities derivative markets from apples to iron ore in Shanghai Zhengzhou and Dalian . China hopes it can do better with statecontrolled oil majors like PetroChina 601857SS and Sinopec 600028SS expected to provide liquidity analysts said the contract has a chance of succeeding even if it faces shortterm caution . President Donald Trump's administration urged a federal judge on Thursday to block ATampampT Inc8217s proposed 85 billion merger with Time Warner Inc saying the deal would hand the company a 8220weapon to harm competition and raise consumer prices . The merger could strengthen the hand of antitrust regulators looking looking at other similarly structured mergers at other antitrust regulators . The Justice Department filed suit in November to stop ATamampT which has some 25 million payTV subscribers from closing the deal from closing ATampAMPT which says a merger would benefit consumers by creating efficiencies and create efficiencies ATamp
---  Three weeks ago Grover Furr charged me with spreading fascist propaganda on CounterPunch because my film review of 8220Bitter Harvest8221 held Josef Stalin accountable for the famine in Ukraine in 19321933 . I advise my readers especially younger ones to visit 8220Stalin8217s Moustache8221 and Furr's websiteamp160to get a handle on a school of thought that has largely died a natural death . I will turn my attention to the historiography of Mark Tauger who he describes in a prefatory note as being a 8220world authority8221 on the famine . Tauger blames a severe drought for the deaths of between 25 to 7 million Ukrainians it is understandable why he would be hoisted on the shoulders of both Furr and Roger Annis a leftist and occasional counter-punch contributor who endorsed Tauger on his 8220 New Cold War Ukraine and Beyond website as a leading authority on famine . He has never written a book about it despite his reputation as a world-wide authority on the famines he has never wrote a book . Despite his reputation Tauger is essential for turning that victim into a criminal, he had an archive of his articles on the U of West Virginia but they seemed to have mysteriously  Lenin's New Economic Policy was a forerunner to the model now adopted by the Cubans . Stalin tended to regard Lenin as the final word on everything . Stalin and Bukharin thought that the peasants should be given free rein . Collectivisation coupled with dekulakisation brought the inability from the communists from the most from monocausalan communists to the peasant . Collective farms brought to a quarter of a million socialised individual economies into a socialised socialised economy . The Years of Hunger of Soviet Agriculture 193119338221amp160 is the most authoritative account of why the famine took place in Russia . Despite not being focused on the Ukraine famine they blame Stalin for the drought, therejecting and brutal forced collectivization for the death of millions of millionss both both Ukrainians and elsewhere and elsewhere . Stalin is the only person to blame Stalin. on the peasant than other parts of the population for the deaths of both Ukrainians . The inability of the communists brought to the most of the Soviet peasants to the socialised collective farms to make the situation worse by the most difficult of the Stalin. Collectivization of Soviet agriculture under state control brought it to a socialisation of socialised and brutal collectivisation to make it worse of the
---  Marcelo and Rocio decided to terminate the pregnancy after visiting six consecutive doctors who refused to perform an abortion . Argentina has a higher abortion rate than any other region in the world . Women who seek an abortion must navigate a winding labyrinth that includes the stillpowerful apparatus of the Catholic Church . Doctors refuse to perform abortions claiming they have conscientious objection because they say the practice is against their religious moralsamp160 According to Human Rights Watch there are approximately 500,000 underground abortions in Argentina each year . Women must often race a corporeal clock roaming from hospital to hospital finally conceding to the eventuality of an underground 8212 and many times unsafe 8212 procedure . Doctors believe their knowledge or religious dogma are above the laws, says Ruth Zurbriggen . Women most often end up in the clandestine circuit . More than 25 times that of Uruguay or Chile where abortion is totally illegal . More women seeking abortions kill more than 25% of the maternal mortality rate more than Uruguay or . Chile where abortions are totally illegal than Chile where it is legal . More post-post-secret abortions kill thousands of Nigerian women each year in Nigeria . Women seeking abortions killing more than 20% of women in Nigeria who are seeking abortions in Nigeria and more than 30% of Nigerian .  Doctor who came from a Catholic family says the issue of abortion is also driven in part by the church . He estimates that he has performed between 2000 and 3000 abortions . The death toll among women accounts for such a high percentage of preventable maternal deaths . Father Ruben Revello is a priest within the Catholic Church of Argentina and the director of the Bioethics Institute for the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina . Revello proposed larger societal barriers need to be addressed to help reduce the maternal mortality rate . He said abortion is a problem of public health a phrase also used by Dolores Fenoy who runs the Ministry of Health . The mortality rate is great and there is often no way to choose to save one life without choosing against the other . The church maintains he said 8220the life of a baby is not more valuable than the life of the mother or a mother . The Church maintains that the lives of both are equally valuable because both share in a common dignity which is the human dignity that is human dignity . The abortion is not always a failure of the baby removed and also a failure to accompany the mother is also said to be a failure in the mother who didn't accompany the partner who didn’t accompany the baby in the baby .
---  Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva turned himself in to police on Saturday ending a daylong standoff to begin serving a 12year prison sentence for corruption that derails his bid to return to power . Lula was convicted of taking bribes including renovation of a seaside seaside apartment that he denies ever owning from an engineering firm in return for help landing public contracts . He will be flown by police to the southern city of Curitiba and held in a special jail cell where he will begin serving his 12year sentence . The imprisonment removes Brazil8217s most influential political figure and frontrunner from this year's presidential campaign throwing the race wide open and strengthening the odds of a more centrist candidate prevailing according to analysts and political foes . The union where Lula 72 sought refuge was the launch pad for his career in the late 1970s leading nationwide strikes that helped to end Brazil's 196485 military dictatorship .

---  Deutsche Telekom will keep to its promise of hiking dividends in 2018 and the years thereafter its Chief Financial Officer Thomas Dannenfeldt told German daily BoersenZeitung that investors should expect continuous growth of capital expenditure sales earnings and dividends . China will take countermeasures of the same proportion and the same scale if the United States imposes further tariffs on Chinese goods, China's ambassador to Washington said amid growing fears of an impending trade war . The US tariffs are expected to target products benefiting from Beijing8217s . China on Sunday announced tariffs on 3 billion in imports of US food and other goods in response to US tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel . China has been bolstering its efforts strengthening its efforts to strengthen its efforts on strengthening its legal system on this particular issue and strengthening its own legal system, the finance ministry said on Wednesday .

US Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels such as ethanol into gasoline or purchase credits from those who do such blending . Andeavor posted net profits of about 15 billion last year . EPA exemption granted about a month ago could reduce firm's regulatory costs by more than 50 million this year . Exemptions designed for refineries producing less than 75000 barrels per day that can demonstrate they suffer economic hardship8221 from the costs of RFS compliance . EPA refuses to release any information on waivers or to name recipients citing concerns over disclosing private business information . EPA denied a Freedom of Information Act request from Reuters seeking information on companies receiving the waivers . Exxon Mobil Chevron and Phillips 66 also own refineries small enough to meet the barrelperday standard as does billionaire investor and Trump ally Carl Icahn whose efforts last year to overhaul the biofuel program drew scrutiny from federal investigators . The White House has sought to broker a deal between two of its key political constituencies in a series of meetings but the effort has failed to yield policy changes acceptable to both sides . Ethanol industry advocates argue exemptions for refiners undermine the intent of the law originally designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions reduce greenhouse gases and boost farm economies .

---  Zozobra's torching of 8220Old Man Gloom8221 returns to a Friday night for the first time in 17 years . Ray Sandoval chief organizer of the event put on each year by the Kiwanis Club said moving it back to Friday night 8211 albeit the Friday of Labor Day weekend and a week before Fiesta de Santa Fe officially opens 8211 is necessary to keep tradition ignited by Santa Fe artist Will Schuster in 1924 alive . Sandoval has remained involved with the event ever since then save for a few years while attending law school in Boston and opening up a law practice in Seattle . He says his lifelong love for the tradition played a part in bringing him back to his hometown . The event attracted just 13,000 to Fort Marcy Park the lowest draw on record last year . Last year the event drew about 32,000 people . Ticket prices were raised to 20 apiece further raising the ire of a faithful but increasingly irritable crowd . The organizers say the price increase came at a time when Zozobbra was beginning to rely on its cash reserves A rainout would have exhausted them entirely But even Sandoval admits the 822020 experiment8221 was a failure . The proceeds help our charities and that we would go to  The Friday before Labor Day was the preferred date from law enforcement to host the Zozobra burning . The new date fits nicely into the schedule of events leading up to the Fiesta8217s official opening on Sept 5 . Ray Sandoval who is in charge of the burning says public safety is his primary concern . Sandoval says there will be 100 private security on hand at Fort Marcy Park tonight . The horse patrol is something that hasn't been seen in more than 10 years . In years past the celebration had gotten out of hand often fueled by alcohol . In 1997 gunfire erupted in the Plaza killing in what police said was a gangrelated shooting that killed Carlos Santiago Romero and two other people were injured by stray bullets . The city hasn't had a horse patrol in over 10 years The steeds are being brought in to patrol the area of the Cross of the Martyrs Martyrs of a city park where in past years they haven’t been in a city area of a park where they haven't seen in 10 years to patrol in the past . At least 150 to 160 officers will be assisting us in addition to SF State State State Police Department’s State Police and other agencies that will assist us in assisting us with the horse patrol .
---  The Bush administration is adept at saying the obvious to hide the devious .

The visits offer a unique opportunity to see just how criminal our government is acting in our name, the author says . The author says. The author also says the USled occupation symbolized by the walledin Green Zone and the reality of 8220a free Iraq is a criminal occupation .

---  Last week the Guardian Britain8217s main liberal newspaper ran an exclusive report on the belated confessions of an Iraqi exile Rafeed alJanabi codenamed 8220Curveball8221 by the CIA . Janabi played a key behindthescenes role 8212 if an inadvertent one 8212 in making possible the US invasion of Iraq . His testimony bolstered claims by the Bush administration that Saddam Hussein had developed an advanced programme producing weapons of mass destruction . The White House did not interview Curveball because they knew his account of Saddam8217's WMD programme was made up Eight years on Curveball revealed to the Guardian that he had fabricated the story of Saddam 8217s WMD back in 2000 shortly after his arrival in Germany seeking asylum . He told the paper he had lied to German intelligence in the hope his testimony might help topple Saddam though it seems more likely he simply wanted to ensure his asylum case was taken more seriously . The German authorities quickly lost interest in Janabi and he was not interviewed again until late 2002 when it became more pressing for the US to make a convincing case for an attack on Iraq a few weeks later . Despite the vital need to get straight all the facts about Curveball 8212 given the stakes involved in launching a preempt  Curveball8217s revelations were of almost no concern to the US media the supposed watchdog at the heart of the US empire . Curveball's confession has come too late 8212 eight years too late to be precise 8212 to have any impact on events that matter . The media cannot fulfil the function of watchdog of power because in fact it is power It is the power of the globalised elite to control and limit the ideological and imaginative horizons of the media 8217s readers and viewers It does so to ensure imperial interests which are synonymous with those of the corporations are not threatened by the media8217 . The Curveball story neatly illustrates the media's role . It is driven by the official official motive of empire than its enabler in good ways in good in good way that enemies such as Slobodan Milosevic can be singled out as personifying evil dictators such as the crazed or crazed dictators . The West cannot allow its reporting to advance its own interests to advance their own interests such as in the invasion to its own reporting to their own selfish reporting to its reporting . The Guardian missed the main point in its own exclusive article . The White House had exploited a 8220fantasist or desperate exile from a brutal regime
---  Insurgent teachers are instructing us all about a tale of denial for which we8217ve paid a heavy price . The American mythos has always rested on a belief that this country was born out of a kind of immaculate conception that the New World came into being and has forever after been preserved as a land without the class hierarchies and conflicts that disfigured Europe . The strikes rallies and walkouts of public school teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona are a stunning reminder that class has always mattered far more in our public and private lives than our origin story would allow . We are accustomed to thinking of teachers as 8220middle class8221 as professional bona fides should entitle them to that social station . School teachers however have always been workingclass stiffs For a long time they were alsoamp160 mainly womenamp160 who would have instantly recognized the insecurities struggles to get by and low public esteem that plague today8217s embattled teachers . Those particular Republican-run states were hardly the only ones to resist the wages of austerity from teachers were the wage of austerity . The sight of teachers striking still has a remarkable ability to shock the rest of us. It just doesn't fit the image still so strong of the mildmannered  Deindustrialization of America has paid handsome dividends to financiers merger and acquisition speculators, junk bond traders and corporations fleeing a unionized work force for the sweated labor of the global South . In the process deindustrialization ravaged the economic and social landscape of workingclass communities including that of redstate teachers . Acquiescence and austerity breed cultural decline a telling sign of which has been the blaming of teachers for a profound social breakdown they were largely the brunt of not the cause of . Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are symptomatic of our moment of resistance to an American world of austerity overseen by plocrats . In both you see the established order losing its grip before the Sanders Sanders campaign were most dramatically in the Occupy Wall Street uprising was shortlived thanks to the Sanders phenomenon . Even though the winds were most dramatic in Occupy Wall St uprising was most notably in the shortlived that short-lived that was a short lived that shortlived but the winds are shifting in the Obama era of this sort of abetted by this sortetted disease disease disease . We live in a pathological condition in Sanders' case of a pathological disease disease of this disease disease, which was abetting by this disease abetts by this kind of disease disease.

His life briefly interesected with that of the greatest green champion of the nineteenth century John Muir who died in 1914 . Muir and Brower ranged themselves on a battlefield infinitely greater in scale . Until Muir no one had fought for an entire regional ecosystem as he did for the Sierras . Brower spent the 1930s watching one vast federal scheme after another scar or drown the western landscapes from the mines abetted by the Bureau of Land Management to the Hoover dam on the Colorado to the opening of the national forests to corporate logging . In 1952 Brower became the first executive director of the Sierra Club at that time a 2000strong group of wellconnected mostly uppercrust Californians . He signed off on the building of the Glen Canyon dam in 1956 as part of a deal to keep the bureau of Reclamation from building the Echo Park dam inside Dinosaur National Monument in northern Utah on the Green River . The decision shadowed him heavily from that day on . The raising of that dam sanctified a certain mindset toward the arid lands what the western historian Donald Worster calls in his book Rivers of Empire calls the dam sanctifies  David Brower was a master organizer generating one of the first great national campaigns in the history of the environmental movement . Brower may not have known just how good he was at hearings on the Upper Colorado Storage Act the bill that was to authorize the Upper Basin dams .

---  The White House has offered some 8220nothing to see here8221 spin in response to the president8217s firing of FBI Director James Comey . But President Donald Trump and White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders have twisted some facts to fit that narrative . Sanders said the investigations by the FBI and congressional committees have gone for 8220 almost an entire year8221 and that there8220 Clapper or others8221 have all come to the same conclusion that there 8220no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians8221 Her comment mirrors Trump8217's tweet two days earlier in which the president claimed the former director of national intelligence said 8220there is 8216no evidence8217 of collusion w Russia and Trump8221 . The president tweeted that he wasn't aware of the FBI investigation into possible collusion between members of the Trump team and Russian operatives until March 20 . After the president called Sen. Chuck Schumer in the past to tell him about the firing Comey was not all that recent that recent quote about the president said he had lost confidence in the White House link to an article about the FBI Director of National Intelligence in a press conference that he lost that he did not have confidence in Comey . Trump later took to Twitter to chastise Democrats who criticized  The first question about the firing of Comey the administration has to answer is 8216Why now8217 If the administration had objections to the way Director Comey handled the Clinton investigation they had those objections the minute the president got into office . But they didn8217t fire him then Why did it happen today? In his letter firing Comey Trump said he relied on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sessions8217 deputy Rod Rosenstein Rosenstein8217 memo primarily cites Comey8217s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton emails . After that press conference Trump frequently quoted the critical comments that Comey made about Clinton at his July 5 2016 press conference . After Comey announced he had reopened the investigation two weeks before the election Trump praised the FBI director At an Oct 31 campaign rally he said Comey had 8220a lot of guts8221 For example a Trump campaign document on 8220 Hillary8217's Lies8221 contained five quotes from Comey 8217s press conference after Comey reopened the Clinton email scandal . The White House has declined to provide an explanation of what Trump said about Comey's decision to disclose his recommendation to the Department of Justice . In his dismissal letter to Comey we asked the White House for an explanation to our questions at a May 10 press briefing
---  There have been troubling reports of a number of Iraqi civilians murdered over the past year by U.S. troops . The military has recently indicted several soldiers and marines . The assertion that American troops are shaped by their nation8217s values is not manifestly implausible and in any case the connection is eagerly praised when framing acts of courage in battle and largesse toward civilians . We boast of our compassionate traits when displayed in war we should acknowledge abhorrent ones if they appear . The nettlesome matter of collateral damage with which only pacifists and defeatists concern themselves anyway was deftly handled by the unguent credo on the young credo of Kill Them All 8211s Tshirt of choice Kill Me All. The 911 attacks must also be admitted did not be admitted to balance the balance the image of the Arab but it must also also be also admitted to the GolanGlobus World events . Soldiers must be wearing down sensibilities and inculating obedience to the community . In basic training the recruit is uprooted and re-oriented into a new training the recruits are uprooted into a total training the new moral environment of the war . The 9/11s tshirt must also include Kill Me Back To Me Back to Me Back  Soldiers learn to put aside much of their pasts and become willing if not eager to pull the trigger . The zeal for violence instilled by early socialization and military training must be held in check by NCOs and officers . Soldiers must assess specific situations as they appear in combat control their troops8217 aggressive impulses and channel them into lawful and tactically appropriate directions . At the tactical level the Dak Tos and Ramadis the A Shau and Tigris valleys this responsibility is placed on soldiers in their early twenties young men under more stress than most can imagine If there is a greater responsibility heaped on a young man I don8217t want to know it At the elevated and remote level of geopolitics the onus of maintaining the line between civilization and barbarism lies with presidents and generals . Soldiers see civilians around them Vietnamese or Iraqi as adepts in the guerilla movement or at least aware of ambush positions and mine locales . The bleak almost paranoid outlook is a natural evolution of the usversusthem world of the infantry which is a useful operating assumption in some places but a useful assumption in other places . In combat the theory of NCO and junior officer discipline at the squad platoon and company levels has to be put into practice more firmly
---  Pew Research Center fielded three large surveys each with over 10000 respondents in June and July of 2016 . The surveys each used the same questionnaire but were fielded with different online optin panel vendors . The survey included questions on political and social attitudes news consumption and religion . The study compares two sets of adjustment variables core demographics age sex educational attainment race and Hispanic ethnicity and census division and a more expansive set of variables that includes both the core demographic variables and additional variables known to be associated with political attitudes and behaviors . These additional political variables include party identification ideology voter registration and identification as an evangelical Christian . The analysis compares three primary statistical methods for weighting survey data raking matching and propensity weighting in addition to testing four techniques where these methods were applied in different combinations for a total of seven weighting methods . The techniques are described in detail below . The results presented in this study are averaged across the three samples to simplify reporting the results presented to the Pew Research Centers . The data came from a variety of questions drawn fromamp160highquality federal surveys that could be used either for benchmarking purposes or as adjustment variables or as adjusting variables . The research was done by taking random subsamples of respondents from each of the three n10000 datasets of survey samples of varying sizes .  Procedure employed here used a target sample of 1500 cases that were randomly selected from the synthetic population dataset . Each case in the target sample is paired with the most similar case from the online optin sample . The final matched sample is matched down to 1500 cases in each of the 1500 matching cases in the matching sample . We fit a statistical model that uses the adjustment variables either demographics alone or demographics political variables to predict which cases came from the target samples and which responses from the survey data . We used a machine learning procedure called a random forest to measure the similarity between cases and the matching itself . We also used this similarity measure as the basis for the propensity weighting of the study . We simulated for this study to a sample of n2000 simulations to a total of 1500 simulations to match n2000 to a final sample of 1000 cases that we always matched down .

---  Eminent domain the right of government to seize private property was written into the US Constitution . But so too was the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment which said that property could be taken only for public use and on condition that its owners be justly compensated . In recent years local governments seeking to draw business and development into primarily residential neighborhoods have increasingly invoked their power of eminent domain to seize houses and put the land they sit on to private use 8212 an expansion of the power that many legal experts deem unconstitutional . Scott Bullock is a Senior Attorney with the Institute for Justice a civilliberties law firm that has taken on several eminent domain and other private property cases that pit homeowners against developers as powerful as Donald Trump 8212 before the US Supreme Court . He is currently working on behalf of residents of Norwood Ohio against developer JR Anderson and the . City of . Norwood which condemned their properties to make way for a shopping and development complex. He is also filing opening briefs in another eminent domain case 8212 this one in New London Connecticut involving an neighborhood slated to become a hotel and condo complex 8212 in New . London Connecticut . The IJ case is before the Supreme Court 8212 . In one IJ Case homes in New Jersey stood in the .  Institute for Justice is challenging the unholy alliance between government and private businesses to take away people8217s property . Institute of Justice says eminent domain is constitutionally recognized power that can be used for true public uses . Institute says government and businesses team up with government to take the land of middle class and oftentimes poor individuals in the hope that the businesses will make a profit and as a result of that profit the city will gain more tax revenue . IJ report on eminent domain found more than 10000 cases of the power being used for private development correct correct SB IJ study was the first effort of its kind to put some real numbers to this problem and to see its extent of the extent of eminent domain in 41 states . The tide is turning and that even courts that had previously supported eminent domain are rethinking this and putting a stop to the power are seeing the abuses and putting some of them to stop them, says IJ . The key thing is to find out as much information as possible about the project and to keep this under the radar as much as possible as possible, says the Institute For Justice. The key to keeping people worried about this is to keep out as little information possible about what are some of the strategies for citizens who may be facing eminent
---  Monday June 12th was the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court8217s landmark 1967 decision . In 1967 Loving v Virginia ended state prohibitions of interracial marriage . The renewed culture wars are a fierce reaction to the economic social and demographic changes reshaping the nation .

Sarkozy said his problems began in March 2011 after he hosted Libyan rebels and went on to become one of the main advocates of a NATOled campaign that resulted in the dictator's overthrow and killing by rebels in 2011 . He also denounced what he described as lies from one of his main accusers a FrancoLebanese businessman who has described himself among other things as a 8220middleman in the shadows8221 on liaison between Paris and Libyan secret service chiefs . The accusations prompted the opening of a judicial inquiry in 2013 which snowballed this week when Sarkozy was called in for interrogation and on Wednesday evening formally placed under investigation as a suspect in the affair . He is challenging an order to stand trial on charges of illicit spending overruns during his failed 2012 campaign .

---  Three major data points have been added to the Palin story in the last week all of them discouraging in the extreme . The Charles Gibson interview was the first last and only chance to see what is really behind the crash course in rote memorization . Palin handlers are furiously pumping her full of Cliff Notes quips about the world she completely ignored all her life as they can jam into her brain in a month . The New York Times proves that the media is actually doing its job for once in the past eight years . The second major data point on Palin is the exception that proves the media rule proves the exception to the rule of the rule . Palin is a complete cipher like Sarah Palin stands as close as she already does to power . The media pretend like a felon and his network and his media pretend to pretend like like a media pretends like a politician like a convicted 8211 and all the media pretender like a criminal 8211 .

The media pretensions to power are all the complicity in the media in pretending to pretend to be like a  Palin's cronyism is so rampant that the Times reports 8220The Wasilla High School yearbook archive now doubles as a veritable directory of state government . Palin has spent 312 of those days at her home in Wasila 600 miles away from the capital and has billed the state per diem expenses for that . She and her staff use private email accounts to conduct state business and purposely chose to do so in order to avoid future scrutiny including potential subpoenas Sarah Palin has now been in office for about 650 days . Palin is a person who appears to be wholly without principle completely without principle wholly without competence in good governance . She knew as early as 1996 that she wanted to be president was willing to do whatever was necessary to get there and now is frighteningly close to achieving her goal . The third and most frightening Palin episode of all is the reaction she has produced in the regressive ranks including amongst most socalled intellectuals .

---  Phillip Garrido kidnapped 11year-old Jaycee Dugard in 1991 and held her captive for 18 years repeated raped and gave birth to two children with only Nancy Garrido's assistance fathered by her kidnapper . Garrido was convicted of kidnap and rape and sentenced to 50 years in prison . He was paroled in 1988 for good behavior and released in 1988 . The full story of what took place for nearly two decades in the backyard compound of the Garrido8217s house in Antioch will probably never be fully known so far the Garridos have admitted little and Duggard's privacy has been respected . The US justice system is a highly politicized bureaucracy and is not organized to prevent what happened in Antioch . The gruesome experience of interpersonal exploitation that occurred in Antioch reflects a more troubling failure of the US Justice system and how it deals with pedophiles and other sex offenders . The media has drawn attention to the screwups by the local police to effectively monitor Garrido . The mainstream media has failed to consider the deeper systemic issues that this episode raises. The full picture of Garrido’s psychological background has yet to emerge nor has the full story has yet been fully known to emerge. The less known about the suffering she endured .

Reports vary as to what happened One account says that they searched his house another says they confirmed Garrido's identity standing in the front yard and departed never entering his house or backyard . Whether Garrido is clinically mentally ill remains to be determined based on rambling postings on his blog an interview he had with a Sacramento TV station and other reported comments he appears to be a deeply troubled man . In a 2007 blog he attributes his newfound courage to divine intervention . In the interview he stated that he is a new man and that he had turned his life around and that the last several years I completely turned my life around . In addition an estimated 100000 former offenders have failed to register given false addresses or simply disappeared .

On September 30 Obama used this asserted new power of the president and had two American citizens Anwar Awlaki and Samir Khan murdered . The presstitutes and the worshippers of America8217s First Black President have fallen in line and regurgitated the assertions that Awlak was a highlevel dangerous Al Qaeda terrorist . Obama asserts that the US Constitution notwithstanding he has the authority to assassinate US citizens who he deems to be a 8220threat8221 without due process of law . In other words any American citizen who is moved into the threat category has no rights and can be executed without trial or evidence .

The US government has always denied such assassinations were not claimed as legitimate actions were not as legitimate events by the president to be below the law of the U.S. President has always claimed that assassinations are not legitimate actions such as the CIA assassinations such as those of foreign foreign enemies of foreign enemies . The Obama Regime is working hard to posthumously promote AwlAK  The war on terror is only an opening for the neoconservative imperial ambition to establish US hegemony over the world as wars of aggression or imperial ambition are war crimes under international law . The Obama Regime like the BushCheney Regime is a regime that does not want to be constrained by law . Those fighting to uphold the rule of law humanity8217s greatest achievement will find themselves lumped together with the regime's opponents and be treated as such . Americans are being led down the garden path to rule by government unrestrained by law and armed with the weapons of the medieval dungeon . Americans have overwhelming evidence from news reports and YouTube videos of US police brutally abusing women children and the elderly of brutal treatment and murder of prisoners not only in Abu Ghraib Guantanamo and secret CIA prisons abroad but also in state and federal prisons in the US . The leaked video US soldiers delight in their actions reveal in their murder from the air of military discipline by the officers devoid of humanity by the US soldiers and military discipline. The leaked videos of U.S. soldiers and their words and words of their words reveal in the street shows soldiers and men walking along a city street shows men and their actions .

---  Israeli defense minister rejects calls for an inquiry into the killing of 15 Palestinians by the military during a Palestinian demonstration that turned violent on Friday at the GazaIsrael border . A tense calm descended on Sunday on the border area where hundreds of Palestinians a fraction of the tens of thousands who initially turned out remained in tent encampments along the fenced 65km 40mile border . Organizers expect many to come back on Friday when schools and businesses are closed for the Muslim sabbath and rejoin the planned sixweek protest pressing for right of return for refugees and their descendents to what is now Israel . A 12yearold Palestinian boy hit by Israeli gunfire on Friday said that when he approached the border fence with others in the crowd he thought he would be safe as long as he did not touch the barrier or throw stones . Pope Francis in an apparent reference to the events in Gaza in his Easter address called for reconciliation for the Holy Land also called for a reconciliation . The protest is scheduled to culminate on May 15 when Palestinians mark the 8220Nakba8221 or 8220Catastrophe when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven out of their homes in 1948 when the state of Israel was created in 1948 .

---  Jerry Brown delivers his first State of the City address sponsored by the Oakland Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce . Brown has spent his career seesawing between the enthusiastic embrace and ascetic rejection of the political life . Brown hasn't always been sure that he wanted to be a politician but has shown a deep resistance to anything that smacks out of ideology . Brown can claim credit for having some of the most progressive policies of any contemporary politician during his terms as governor . He appointed an unprecedented number of women and minorities to a number of high-ranking positions and enacted the nation8217s first agricultural labor law . But he has shown deep and deep opposition to anything he has ever shown to be deep and resistant to anything to be smacks of ideology. Brown has turned out to be the most radical mayor in America. He has always been a deep and skeptical of his approach to smacks and smacks to smack out of his government. Brown is a deep-seated ideology that smacked out of politics. Brown’s approach to politics. He is a red-faced politician. Brown. Brown says he has always always been skeptical of anything that he wants to change the status quo. He wants to make Oakland a place that is ‘exciting’  Brown has shown skill at harnessing that euphoria and using it to power his own agenda in the year since his election . Brown has been singleminded in his attention to the crime issue embracing a federal program that establishes a five-year prison sentence for illegal gun possession and backing several policies that seem modeled in part on measures that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani adopted to clean up New York City . Brown's gift for garnering media attention has convinced many of them that their time has come at last . While you wait for social change you have to wait for great social change with people like Helen Prejean and Sister Sister Sister Helen like Jonathan Kozolean understand the link between poverty and crime and we have a crime . While Brown is quick to say that Giuliani82zero tolerance should apply to police misconduct as well as well to say he has little interest in wading into a philosophical discussion about the underlying causes of social unrest as he should . Brown recently recalled one of my opponents said: "We don't have a . problem we have . a poverty problem and We have a social problem and we . have a problem" Brown recalled the topic on the airwaves quite quite quite well with Sister Helen PreJean and said that she understands the link with the topic
---  Eight years ago today the German parliament 8212 approved the first two of several laws and emendations that would encompass the Nuremberg Laws . The laws outlawed marriage and sexual relations between Jews and non-Aryans . Jews were stripped of German citizenship and turned into subjects of the Nazi Reich . Jews could no longer raise the German flag now adorned with the swastika or display the Reich8217s colors . As non-citizens Jews could also no longer vote notwithstanding the meaninglessness of voting in a oneparty state . No Aryan woman under fortyfive could serve as a domestic worker in a Jewish household lest she be subject to the lecherous advances of Jewish men or be tainted by Jewish surroundings . The Nazis declared a Jew to be anyone with at least three Jewish grandparents or at least two Was 8220Jewishness8221 a religion a race or both . The secret police set up to oversee the appeals process of the appeal process to be pushed into the category of half-Jews who would be pushed to be the half-Jewish category of appeals to the Jewish category of appealing appeals to appeals to Jewish women . Nuremb Laws marked a turning point in the F252hrer8217's assault on minorities and its edifice was shaky .  The Nuremberg Laws were a signal moment in the history of European Jewry marking what some scholars have described as a wellplanned march toward extermination . The international dimensions of these laws are key to understanding how fundamental race and racism were to modern industrial societies . The laws undeniably constituted a Jewish tragedy but it is worth recalling that in 1935 Nazi Germany was not the only country where color lines were becoming more rigid . Long before 1933 Germans studied official policies toward Native Americans and African Americans looking for lessons they could apply to their own empire . Germans turned to settler colonialism and plantation economics abroad in order to puzzle through their own questions about racial separation labor exploitation and sexual prohibitions For the Nazis the racial order of the U.S. was of particular interest Well into the 1930s thirty states had antimiscegenation laws on the books . The Nazis sent students to the United States South Africa and Latin America to collect information about racial persecution and legal segregation around the world They left behind bulging files of newspaper clippings dealing not only with African Americans but also with Australia8217s measures against aboriginals Scandinavian sterilization laws and Japanese views of race and Japanese view of race And the Nazis sent student Heinrich Krieger spent a year at the University of Arkansas
---  Gary in Helen Georgia, Georgia, is a 20-year-old friend of Rush Limbaugh . He says football poses a threat to the left . The DriveBys want to maybe take down the NFL or knock the NFL back a peg or two . Rush Limbaugh says football is too patriotic, too patriotic and a lot of money is a target on so many levels of money . Gary in Georgia is a hayseed hick who goes to church on Sunday and collects money sometimes on Sunday . Limbaugh: Football is too much a part of the fabric of our country and it may not be immune to this type of culture . Limbaugh says he doesn't think football will be able to do anything about college football or the NFL. He says it will be tough for the left to take this down. It may be tough to get rid of it. It will be hard for them to get a concession here or a concession from high school or to get it banned. It's too much of the American flag is on full display before every game. There aren8217t any equalization plans or processes that take place other than the draft. There isn't any affirmative action in it. There is no equalization of the draft or equalization in it . There are no affirmative action  Don't forget what sports has always been for fans to one degree or another . Sports as an adult is the one thing you can invest total passion in without consequence . The more passion you show for your team the more your team is gonna love you. The more rabid the more into the team but still you could have all kinds of things going wrong in your life If your team wins it mitigates it somehow. It just is that way it is In small towns like Pittsburgh and Kansas City I marvel at how the performance of the local sports team actually can determine the selfesteem of a population of a city . The NFL is not an escape from the humdrum of the rest of your life anymore but the last three months have been happening to it but it is not the last two years. The NFL isn't gonna be an escape anymore anymore. It's not gonna be the escape anymore. If this continues to be a reminder it was once it was to be what it was. An escape It was once to be the once-to-one-on-the-field escape. the game. It isn't going to be once the escape. It was a reminder of what it is once the once and once and it was the once
---  Naomi Klein and 350orgs Bill McKibben play a key role in the 21city Do the Math climatemovement roadshow that arrived at the soldout Orpheum that night . The pair launched a studentled divestment campaign calling on universities to stop investing in fossil fuels . Each has a tough message for their own constituency for an environmental movement that has been woefully ineffective on climate . Each of the two has been plenty serious in their respective ways for a long time with some of the world's leading environmental writers and activists . But seeing them on stage together launching a mathematical and moral assault on the carbon corporatocracy says something significant about the charged atmosphere of this particular moment as we end a year . It says something about the direction the climate movement may be taking or taking or the direction Klein argues it should be taking as they seek to merge climate and climate justice and climate and economic justice in a way that goes beyond traditional environmental and climate school and the old school climate justice . Each is taking or rather the direction of the political climate justice or climate justice in the direction they argue it should take as they merge into the oldschool climate and the new school climate and old school of the old-school climate school . The new school of climate justice  Naomi Klein's new book is an attempt to weave together disparate movements under the banner of rising to meet the greatest crisis humanity has ever faced . The climate crisis is the ultimate indictment of capitalism and the solutions are the same as the solutions to the economic crisis . Klein wants to see more young activists inspired and galvanized by the Occupy movement making the same connections to the climate issue . Climate change lends urgency to our fights for social justice like nothing else before Klein said . The refusal to accept the importance of economic justice is the reason we have had no climate action . Climate debt remains a sticking point for global climate treaty as witnessed again at the UN conference in Doha last week at Doha . The issue remains a certain amount of poverty to develop any amount of any amount that remains a key point for climate treaty . The key to developing any of the key issues remains the amount of developing countries to pull any amount to develop certain amount to pull themselves out of poverty. The key issue remains the certain amount that any of any number of poverty develop any certain amount . The people who are most responsible for creating climate poverty. There should be a right to pull oneself out of itself out of oneself . We need the environmental movement but not if theyre going to develop
---  The Annapolis meeting between Olmert and Abbas is preconditioned upon the recognition by the Palestinian side of the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state . The existence of the Jewish state must never become a core issue that unites political opinion left and right and persists as a pragmatic view of many Palestinians who would prefer some improvement to no improvement at all . Israel constitutes a 8220problem8221 but never an 8220issue8221 because God forbid to make it an issue on the table would be to threaten the existence of Israel as a . Jewishness is not important and at any rate the feeble consensus around them is constantly reinvented in Israel . The Jewish state a supposedly potential haven for all the Jews in the world in the case a second Holocaust comes about should be recognised as a second . What do we do we recognise and support when we invite Israel to take part a date from Israel? What does it mean it mean to be a friend of Israel in an international event or when it takes part of an international . What does we do? What do it mean we mean it means it means we support the state of Israel or when we support it? We need to recognise it when we buy an avocado or an Israeli football .  In our world a world that resisted Apartheid South Africa so impressively recognition of the right of the Jewish state to exist is a litmus test for moderation and pragmatism . The demand is that Palestinians recognise Israel8217s entitlement to constitutionally entrench a system of racist basic laws and policies . The Right of Return of Palestinians means that Israel acknowledges and apologises for what it did in 1948 It does mean that Palestinian memory of the 1948 catastrophe the Nakbah is publicly revived in the Geography and collective memory . A return would make the egalitarian claim by those who return even more difficult to conceal than currently with regard to Israel Arab second class citizens . Equality of stake involves equality of stake involve equality of ownership and ownership of symbolic ownership and settlements rights . But it is important to emphasis that what what it would mean would mean that what would mean the Palestinian right of Return would cease to cease to exist would be the Jewish as well as a Jewish as a Muslim state, including the Jewish As well as the Jewish State of Israel would be justice and that would be that nature of the laws that stems from the Jewish nature of Jewish state of the law itself would be including that of the state itself . We need to be generous generosity and peace with it .
---  German conglomerate Bayer won EU antitrust approval on Wednesday for its 625 billion buy of US peer Monsanto the latest in a trio of mega mergers that will reshape the agrochemicals industry . The tieup is set to create a company with control of more than a quarter of the world8217s seed and pesticides market . Environmental and farming groups have opposed all three deals worried about their power and their advantage in digital farming data which can tell farmers how and when to till sow spray fertilize and pick crops based on algorithms . The European Commission said Bayer addressed its concerns with its offer to sell a swathe of assets to boost rival BASF confirming a Reuters story on Feb 28 . Australia said on Thursday it would not oppose the deal following the divestment commitment . The US Justice Department which is also reviewing the merger said in a statement on its website that it would press on with its review and that the market in the two regions was quite different . China has given conditional approval to the Bayer and Monsanto deal which has won a green light in Brazil . The Commission is due to rule on the BASF deal by April 16 .

The corporate state no longer able to peddle a credible ideology is becoming more overtly totalitarian It will increasingly silence dissidents out of fear that the truth they speak will spark a contagion It will also silence dissidents . The more discredited the state becomes the more it will communicate in the language of force, writes George Lake Eugene M Langy the Professor for Visiting Issues in Social Change at George Lake Lake Eugene .

Instead what was done in the civil rights movement we would have called 8216 they kept their eyes on the prize . They knew the prize was to push away the economic elite get rid of its dominance so they can set up a new economic system which is now called the Nordic model . Resistance he stressed will come from outside the formal political system It will not be embraced by either of the two main political parties or the establishment which is under corporate control . The Democratic Party is out to lunch and the Republican Party is actively grinding us, he said . But even so we can make tremendous strides and start building that mass movement which in Norway and Sweden was able to push the economic elites away .

Titillation is not to be cast aside in this glum era even though its relief is fleeting, but its relief must be fleeting .

---  The Occupation by Ali Allawi who held the posts of trade defense and finance ministers in successive governments following the US invasion of Iraq is the most detailed and thorough account yet of this imperial war crime . The book is written by Allawis8217 who held positions in the US government following the March 2003 invasion . The US has wrecked rather than reconstructed Iraqi society and stoked a civil war between Sunni and Shia Muslims that has now taken hold and is wreaking horrific damage . In the 1970s Iraq had the living standards of Greece and today it ranks below Burundi as one of the poorest countries in the world . The occupation of Iraq began with the March 3, 2003 invasion of the country in March 2003 and has caused the death of at least 655,000 Iraqis since the invasion of Baghdad in the new phase of its war on Iraq began in 2003 . Iraq has been en en en route to a decade and a half of strict economic sanctions and sanctions between the US and the US has destroyed its living standards in the past decade and is now one of world's poorest countries . The occupiers had no plan for the occupation and had no strategy for a new government but had no plans for the reconstruction of a new Iraqi state . The majority of the US establishment had  Iraqi Army with Order No 2 led fired Sunni officers and soldiers to join the developing resistance . The order thrust hundreds of thousands of Shia into unemployment without much hope of a job in a desperately poor country Bremer also decreed freemarket reforms to privatize stateowned businesses and open up Iraq to international investors . Only the Kurds supported the occupation without reservation The Sunni resistance developed in mosques where clerics denounced the real injustices of the occupation and supported armed action Increasingly resistance leaders drew on Sunni fundamentalism8211from the rest of the Middle East rather than within Iraq where it had not had a base . The resistance mounted a campaign of attacks designed to isolate the US from its allies attacking the UN offices of countries like Jordan and Iraqi civilians who collaborated with the occupation . US turned to repression to put down the growing Sunni8211and eventually Shia resistance . In the spring of 2004 Bremer nearly united all tendencies of the resistance into a genuine national liberation struggle when he simultaneously provoked uprisings in predominantly Shia Najaf and predominantly Sunni Falluja . In March Bremer railed that he wanted Sadr8217s forces rose up across the South and occupied Najaf . But in November 2004 the US ordered an assault on the resistance in Fallu .
---  On November 7th of this year a major 2003 Guantanamo Standard Operating Procedures SOP manual was posted on the wikileaks web site . The Miami Herald describes the manual and its importance and give a flavor of its bureaucratic contents 8220A howto manual it draws back a curtain on the secretive isolated base in 2003 more than a year into operation of the Bush administration prison . The Department of Defense has attempted to avoid its release and has denied the American Civil Liberties Organization ACLU access under the Freedom of Information Act . Despite claims to the contrary the US was hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC . The manual also indicates some prisoners were designated as off limits to visitors from the ICRC something the military has repeatedly denied . The denial of ICRC access was in violation of the Geneva Conventions which state all prisoners must have access to all premises occupied by prisoners of war . The second major revelation from the SOP concerns the routine use of isolation and sensory deprivation on Guantanamo detainees in order to weaken them and make them ready for interrogations and prepare them for interrogation and trial by Military Commission . In fact for only one of the four levels was the IRC allowed unrestricted access to ask the detainee whatever questions they deemed appropriate . The restrictions may have been one reason that the administration  Isolation was one of the interrogations techniques authorized by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in his April 16 2003 memo . The APA included clauses in its 2007 resolution against torture that allows continued participation in the use of isolation and sensory deprivation in certain circumstances . The recent Physicians for Human RightsHuman Rights First report Leave No Marks Enhanced Interrogation Techniques and the Risk of Criminality details the negative effects of isolation . The technique is not know to have been generally used for interrogation purposes for longer than 30 days . It should never be sanctioned as a routine tool for 8220fostering dependence on the interrogator . Such uses are immoral and are likely violations of the UN Convention Against Torture and the US Torture & War Crimes Acts As thee PHRHRF report argues .

---  Teachers at William Rainey Harper High School have gathered in a large conference room to explore creative ways to conduct 100minute classes . Five teachers put one idea into practice role playing role playing in a special education classroom . Students and parents give varying accounts of how much has changed at Harper with some still questioning the value of reconstitution . Nathaniel Mason whom schools chief Paul Vallas plucked out of Lincoln Park High School has been the best change of all . Attendance has risen from 748 percent to 785 percent 91 percent of the school . The course failure rate has dropped 4 percent since last year from 642 percent to 608 percent at Harper and the six other high schools that were restaffed last summer also are making notable progress he says citing their principals8217 cooperative approach to management . The number of fire alarms is down too So far of pr pr pranks of pranks has decreased for the number of teachers who have been pranked down too so far this year there has been only one compared with 34 compared with the total of last year compared with a total of 34 last year . The school also maintains an outreach program for students who fail to show up by three days to three days a week for just the three days for the three weeks .  Harper has stressed high expectations in terms of students8217 behavior8221 says Mason Mason The principal . Mason says he spoke with students after a recent fire alarm gave way to a fight involving 10 students . Harper has concentrated on reading and math so far . Mason suggests incentives to draw and retain quality teachers at reconstituted schools . Harper also hired two elementary school teachers with elementary school experience to teach freshmen with reading scores below 80 or the beginning of 8th grade . Students still seem to have a lack of motivation, says Mia Gamble who came from a school in the suburbs in the early years of the school . Mason: "I applaud the Office of Accountability for trying to end social promotion" The bottom line for all reconstitution schools as well as schools on probation is improvement in reading, math and math is improving in reading and reading . Harper is not used to use of punitive or vindictive but will support people who will support those who are getting tangible results for the use ofictive line for those people8217s8217’s efforts to support people8218” says Mason . The school calls home tardies and the school calls it ‘home’ and says it is not punitive but it is “punitive or vind
---  Emma Gonzalez Senior Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School walked out of school in response to the Parkland massacre . Emma Gonzalez and Emma Gonzalez are among the students who have been inspired by the massacre of their peers at their local high school . The Parkland killings were the first school walkout since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut in 2012 . The students were spurred to action by the horrors of the massacre and emboldened by watching videos of its protesting students organized a walkout of their own . One of the students answered the question by writing out a questionnaire about what stresses you out of the semester . One student said that he had no idea how to respond because honestly I feel the way because he didn't feel the same. The one thing that stresses me out is the fact that I might die in this building that I had to confront the fact I had no choice to respond to that question. The students are all forced to confront their fears and that none of us will ever be able to answer the question. It was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear thatamp160heamp160was the shooter. 8220It was a student who knew that he was the shooter8221 8212.

The archetype of the teachermartyr who toils late into the night sacrificing her personal life in order to focus solely on her students is one we8217ve bought into as a culture . The story we tell is that teachers are superhuman capable of reversing any tide remedying any hurt and counteracting any problems by sheer focus persistence and care . We are not warriors we are teachers We are teachers. We are . not heroes we are . teachers . The president of the United States holding them up as icons is simply another way of continually refusing to honor and respect the profession in the ways that actually matter . Teachers should never have had to put their lives on the line for their students It wasn8217t their job It wasn’t their . job It isn’s a Sisypheyphean after all of the . students’. The truth is those teachers should not have put their . students in front of bullets to save their students. We should not be martyring ourselves by taking a bullet for our students. The ultimate expression of this archetype is a badge of honor in the school itself. It is the ultimate expression.

The death of the 22yearold father of two was the latest in a string of killings of black men by police that have triggered street protests and fueled a renewed national debate about bias in the US criminal justice system . Saturday's demonstration brought together a multiracial crowd many holding signs such as 8220Stop Police Rage8221 and 8220Power to the People8221 It was led by retired NBA player Matt Barnes who grew up in the area and had two stints with the Sacramento Kings franchise .

---  The ghosts that haunt Senator John McCain are about 600 in number and right now they are mustering for an onslaught . McCain one of America8217s foremost Republicans and President Barack Obama's opponent in 2008 is currently locked in a desperate bid for political survival in his home state of Arizona . McCain was held in a North Vietnamese prison for five years and returned to the US as a war hero . His nemesis is Sydney Schanberg a former New York Times reporter who won a Pulitzer prize for his reporting from Cambodia that formed the basis for the Oscarwinning movie The Killing Fields . In 1990 there were so many stories sightings intelligence reports of American POWs left behind in Vietnam after the war was over that pressure from Vietnam vets and the families of the MIAs prompted the formation of a special committee of the US Senate to investigate . The Senate committee was led by John Kerry a Navy man who had served in Vietnam McCain as a former POW was its most pivotal member Down the years Schanenberg has pieced together the evidence much of it covered up by the Senate committee . In 1993 an American historian unearthed in Soviet archives the record of a Vietnamese general to the Soviet politbureau . The CIA officials said their intelligence indicated strongly that the remaining POWs were eventually executed  The American Conservative a monthly released a special issue 8216The Men our Media Forgot8217 with Schanberg 8216 .

McCain's father was a prominent US admiral at the time commander of all US forces in the Pacific McCain Jr. a POW he had broken and cooperated with his North Vietnamese captors . His accusers said disclosed vital information and made broadcasts denouncing the US which were then used by the Vietnamese to break other POWs .

---  The Party of the Democratic Revolution PRD was born 19 years ago in a blaze of gunfire that took the lives of more than 500 sympathizers . The PRD evolved from the wreckage of the fraudblighted 1988 presidential election stolen by the longruling Institutional Revolutionary Party PRI . The younger Cardenas ran as the candidate of a hastilyimprovised coalition the National Democratic Front FDN that included four moribund parties usually aligned with the PRI remnants of the Mexican Communist Party gathered together in the Unified Socialist Party PSUM and the Party of Revolutionary Workers PRT a Trotskyite aggregation and the Mexican Workers Party PMT under the tutelage of left illuminati Heberto Castillo But the overwhelming majority of the PRD founders were exPRIistas who had abandoned the thenofficial party . The majority of PRD founder were like Cardenras and his sidekick former Mexican labor secretary and diplomat Porfirio Munoz Munoz Ledo . The campaign snowballed from plaza to plaza throughout the country . To a gringo reporter the campaign was bathed in history Everywhere Cuauhtemoc Carden as it traveled through 31 states and the federal district he carried with him the notes 8220apuntes8221 that Lazaro Card  The PRD was torn asunder by squabbling and backstabbing between the 16 8220currents8221 later 8220tribes8221 who had come together for the founding . At the core of the dispute was the party8217s vision would it be a confluence of activist movements for whom elections were only one strategy for achieving social change or would the PRD be a conventional if progressiveminded party dedicated to tooting its own horn and winning a quota of political power . As the party grew to become a major player in Mexican politics the internal strife only intensified . In the 1999 party 8220presidenciales8221 Amalia Garcia a former communist and now governor of Zacatecas went up against congressperson Jesus Ortega in a contest remembered in PRD annals as 8220El Cochinero or the Pigsty 8211 the fraud was so redolent that the votetaking had to be redone the next year when Garcia was declared the victor . In 2003 Amalia Robles bought the party election with the questionable financial backing of her lover a crooked construction contractor who later would seek to blackmail PRD with videos he secretly filmed of lowranking party officials stuffing packets of Yanqui dollars into their suit coat pockets .

Wall Street took advantage of the gigantic flow of capital coming into the country 700 billion per year via the current account deficit by creating more and more MBSs and selling them to foreign banks hedge funds and insurance companies . The banks were merely the mortgage originators they didn8217t believe their own money was at risk so they lowered lending standards and issued millions of loans to unqualified applicants who had no job no collateral and a bad credit history . The mortgages were then shipped off to Wall Street where they were sold to credulous investors . The low interest rates in turn stimulate speculation which results in equity bubbles and led to crisis . Eventually credit expansion leads to crisis when borrowers can no longer make the interest payments on their loans and defaults spiral out of control This forces massive deleveraging and  Wall Street landscape has changed completely . Investment banking is no longer a viable business model . Big 5 have either vanished or transformed themselves into holding companies to escape short sellers . Wall Street has turned off the faucet for securitized investments that market is toast .

Treasury is currently distributing 700 billion to key banks and other financial institutions that are perceived to be 8220too big to fail8221 In truth the mantra is a just public relations hoax to conceal the web of counterparty deals that make it impossible for one institution to fail without dominoing through the rest of the system and wreaking havoc That is why AIG is still on lifesupport with regular injections of taxpayer money it had roughly 4 trillion of credit default swaps structured .

---  The scheme concocted by the pharmaceutical industry and pushed forward by the Bush administration to screen the entire nation8217s public school population for mental illness and treat them with controversial drugs was already setting off alarms among parents all across the country . The first notice of intent to sue was filed this month in Indiana by Michael and Teresa Rhoades who were outraged when they learned their daughter had been given a psychological test at school without their consent . The parents allege that when their daughter took the test she was improperly diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder after taking the TeenScreen survey . The family intends to seek the 8220maximum amount of damages8221 . Tax dollars are already funding TeenScreen and many of the drugs purchased by the new customers it recruits are already being funneled through state governments to fund TeenScreen . The program does not receive financial support from the government and its website statement that TeenScreen is not affiliated with or funded by any pharmaceutical companies8221 is also a blatant lie . Taxpayers are already paying an enormous price as a result of marketing schemes designed designed to get students hooked on antipsychotic drugs designed to tax payers are already already paying for the enormous price designed to pay for the drugs that must be prescribed for kids .  Texas now spends more money on medication to treat mental illness for lowincome residents than on any other type of prescription drug . The TMAP was approved in Texas in 1995 and by 2002 Texas Medicaid spent 328 million for Lilly8217s antipsychotic drug Zyprexa . Pennsylvania taxpayers are saddled with PennMap its own version of the Texas list of expensive drugs for the treatment of mentally ill as a result of a the pharmaceutical scheme used to infiltrate public institutions and influence state officials and treatment practices . Pennsylvania officials who approved the drugs for PennMap were receiving improper or illegal financial rewards from drug companies involved in promoting the program . PennMap officials with influence over the PennMap program received financial benefits from the drug companies that had a stake in getting PennMap accepted . Pennsylvania's top pharmacist repeatedly took money from Pfizer and other outside sources violating ethics laws a government panel found .

---  Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah have announced a deal agreed to during this month8217s Cairo Reconciliation talks . Despite the grim prospects Hamas has a historic opportunity to achieve elementary civil rights for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon . Hamas is under heavy pressure to reconcile with Fatah given the escalating humanitarian crisis throughout the Gaza strip which has been intensified by the siege imposed by Egypt and Israel as well increasingly from Palestinian public opinion in Gaza calling for a better quality of life by lifting economic pressures Hamas is currently in high demand from various interests and has an excellent opportunity to demand a human rights consideration of Iran Hezbollah Fatah and Syria . The concept may appear deceptively simplistic But this observer who has had the opportunity to work on this fundamental human rights issue the past several years with the BeirutWashington DC based Palestine Civil Rights Campaign PCRC is optimistic it may well be achieved via the following steps briefly discussed below . In addition after half a dozen failed attempts it now appears that all the concerned parties are finally supportive of Palestinian reconciliation including the various countries and their militias that continue destroying Syria and her people Hamas is optimistic that reconciliation will be achieved . One phone call from Tehran or Damascus to Hezbollah in south Beirut can after three decades of excuses grant Palestinian refugees the most basic civil rights  Palestinians in Lebanon waiting for the first opportunity to return to their country is overdue . For more than three decades Iran has not acted on this elementary civil rights issue but rather has instructed Hezbollah to offer only 8220Resistance8221 words but nothing more substantive Hezbollah has complied . Despite annual Al Quds and Ashoura Day rhetoric to the contrary notwithstanding Hezbollah as well as Lebanon8217s other sects is well aware that it would require only 90 minutes of Lebanon's Parliament time to enact Palestinian civil rights to work and home ownership that virtually every refugee on earth is granted by international humanitarian law . Lebanon is the sole UN member state out of 193 that has ignored its international obligations and also its multiple agreements with Washington when it accepts American aid . Hamas also patiently continues to negotiate with Iran which as noted below wants to restore full relations with Hamas for several reasons . The FatahHamas Palestinian conflict cannot accurately be reduced to being just a 8220power struggle8221 because while it is one significant aspect of the problem there are more major barriers to Palestinians refugees in Lebanon being able to achieve civil rights . The parties have not been able to agree on essential fundaments or even on a definition of Palestine at Oslo Accords Fatah gave up approximately 80 of historic Palestine
---  A review of US government documents financial data and other opensource material by TomDispatch however reveals that an American military building boom yet to be seriously scrutinized analyzed or assessed is underway in the Middle East . The Pentagon has been pouring significant sums of money into base and port facilities since 2001 since 2001 . Despite recent largescale insurgent suicide bombings that have killed scores of civilians and the fact that well over 100000 US troops are still deployed in that country coverage of the US war in Iraq has been largely replaced in the mainstream press by the previously forgotten war8221 in Afghanistan . Still others will be stationed close by8212 on bases throughout the region where with little media attention since the runup to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 construction to harden expand and upgrade US and allied facilities has gone on to this day has gone to this today . The buildup has not however however has been remarkably minimal given the implications for future conflicts in the oil heartlands of the planet . Washington is sending tremendous amounts of military materiel into autocratic Middle Eastern nations and buildingup bases in countries whose governments due to domestic public opinion often prefer that no publicity be given to the growing American military infrastructure in the region . Qatar is all but indispensable to the U.S. military  Work is also going on in nearby Oman where in the 1930s the British Royal Air Force utilized an airfield on Masirah Island for its ventures in the Middle East . From 2003 to 2009 the US Army spent in excess of 502 million on contracts for construction projects in the small oilrich nation while the Air Force added almost 55 million and the Navy another 7 million Total military spending there has been more massive still . The Pentagon has spent nearly 20 billion in Kuwait buying huge quantities of Kuwaiti oil and purchasing logistical support from various contractors for its facilities there and elsewhere among other expenditures . According to a recent Congressional Research Service report the Pentagon has received from and received from military equipment and related military equipment worth over 6 billion and foreign military sales . The U.S. government has also received over 171 billion of foreign military equipment, related through Foreign Military Sales FMS worth over six billion and military construction services .

The United States has also benefited from foreign assistance from the U.N. government funds for such projects as building two 8220multistory facilities for the US Navy and related projects as well as building 8220the Freedom Souq in Bahrain8212a 188000 square feet
---  In 8220Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Paulo Freire advocated for a teaching practice that shatters a town8217s 8220culture of silence . Paulo asked us to imagine creative modes to address this silence and then act on it as teachers . What about the culture of silence surrounding the local medical clinic? In doctors8217 offices around the country there exists a veritable Lock Box of stories and secrets about the sea of troubles all around us . The clinic is where every single day hundreds of thousands of testimonies about our afflictions go to die never systematically broadcast to the citizenry atlarge If my students8217 reportage is any indication then most people suffer the traumas of capital and its preferred medical approach biomedicine in relative silence This is no longer acceptable As Foucault puts it 8220 The real political task in a society such as ours is to criticize the workings of institutions that appear to be both neutral and independent to criticize and attack them in such a manner that the political violence that has always exercised itself obscurely through them will be unmasked so that one can fight against them . The real task in society such a society is to criticise and attack institutions that seem to be neutral to criticize them  Doctors by large are the real secrets of modern medicine are protected by tradition groupthink and system constructs punish system constructs that punish system of professional conformity and public silence . I spent three years 19982001 performing a holistic environmental health assessment for local government a public health department in Greater Lansing Michigan in an applied anthropological effort to unmask these relationships and make connections between health medicine and the environment . Local hospitals refused to release emergency room disease data to public health . The government suppressed them and ordered me never to mention them again even after 250000 in expenses I left the government and together with Roundtable member Dave Dempsey had the reports released by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility PEER to a national audience . In his book Lock Box Medicine in a 8220Managed Democracy, we learn how might that serve as the basis for a public pedagogy to stir citizens to political action in our own towns and communities What might we learn? We need to use this to stir people to take action against the polluting factories and factories. We are not afraid to ignore environmental threats or to censor critical initiatives from within their bureaucracies. We have no real money in prevention. We don’t want to ignore the environmental threats. We want to make their millions of dollars in prevention
---  The number of stemcell clinics across the United States has surged from a handful in 2010 to more than 170 today according to figures compiled by The Associated Press . Stem cells are thought to hold potential for treating many diseases and injuries including Lou Gehrigs disease multiple sclerosis lupus and erectile dysfunction . Critics say entrepreneurs are treating patients with little or no evidence that what they do is effective Or even safe They point to anecdotal accounts of seemingly miraculous recoveries . Some early adopters have expanded into chains offering doctors across the country a chance to join the franchise after buying some equipment and attending a seminar . Doctors who join the network generally charge about 9000 per procedure they pay Berman and his partner 25,000 to 30000 for a South Korean cellseparating machine and other equipment . One national chain markets itself online with accounts of celebrity athletes who have been treated with its stem cell procedures . The cost is high ranging from 5000 to 20000 for stem cell treatments including those who have had two patients die under his care . Critics point to one stemcell doctor who has had two stemcell doctors die under their care under the supervision of other doctors . The marketing marketing of these unproven interventions is premature and unprofessional if not unethical if not ethical if not .  Cell Surgical has hired consultants to follow up with patients over the phone and survey how they are feeling . The clinics insist that their treatments are safe but routinely require that patients sign waivers . Patients of Dr Zannos Grekos a cardiologist in Bonita Springs Florida who specialized in using stem cells to treat debilitating diseases also were required to sign a consent form acknowledging the procedures risks including death . Families of at least two of Grekos patients say he downplayed the risks . Critics say regulation must come from the FDA which regulates experimental drugs and regulates products on a national level . Stem cell doctors are rare because medical boards generally begin investigating practitioners only after patients have been harmed that only a handful of cases have been reported . The FDA has only cracked down on a handful on stem cell clinics which observers say has emboldened the industry which have emboldened observers say the agency has been emboldened to emboldened industry which say the industry has emboldens the industry to take action against some of the most dangerous practices . State state medical boards have taken action against only handful of stem cell doctors which say they have only experienced experienced experienced stem cell surgeons and conduct unprofessional or dishonorable conduct or conduct unethical practices . In some cases its virtually impossible to evaluate their record of success

Stevens was justly celebrated for his use of closeups in this movie 8211 which must obviously have had something to do with the extreme physical attractiveness of his stars Elizabeth Taylor who was only seventeen at the time the movie was shot still has the power to take your breath away perhaps more even in black and white than in color . The mystery of Mona Lisa is focused on George and this comes back in the final scene as the moral moral of the film as the key to the film when the question of what he was thinking at the moment of the moral of what the film was raised by the priest . Then another of those superimposed images appears to unlock the secret for us at last which isn't a secret of a secret at last 8211 and allow the priest to conclude 8211 .

Inequality takes the form of dominance hierarchies based on power and coercion and privileged access to resources . Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century said that human beings without a sovereign power to keep the peace would war against each other and have nasty brutish and short lives . But human beings also have the opposite potential We can be the best source of love and learning and cooperation and assistance of every kind in a sense Hobbes was wrong about people in a state of nature He was right about the potential for conflict but people have avoided conflict through food sharing gift exchange and great social equality for example in huntergatherer societies . We can both lived in the most tyrannical and tyrannical societies. Weve lived in most egalitarian societies. It shows which shows us which shows which part of our potential developing our potential to fend for our potential were developing for ourselves. We can do both our potential and help each other’s needs and help us with each other. We’ve got to go to prison in Japan or one of the more unequal countries you are very likely to come out a good
---  Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb praised food group Nestle8217s chief but is keeping up the pressure with demands that the company move faster to overhaul its strategy . Loeb said he wants the Swiss company to buy back more of its stock at a quicker pace and sell its stake in beauty business L8217Oreal . The influential investor said the company now has to make good on promises including boosting its exposure in highgrowth areas such as coffee pet care bottled water and nutrition while selling 8220illfitting businesses8221 more quickly . He expressed some concern about why the company pushed more deeply into consumer healthcare with the purchase of Canadian vitamin maker Atrium Innovations AIIIUL . The ecommerce giant employs about 15 lobbyists according to earlier disclosures submitted to the US Senate with another 15 outside lobbying firms who each assign more lobbyists to work on behalf of the company . The retailer spent 154 million in 2017 on lobbying in Washington up from 12 million a year earlier . Amazon had cut ties with Washington lobbying firms Akin Gump Strauss Hauer ampamp Feld LLP and Squire Patton Boggs Bloomberg reported last Friday and in their place hired Paul Brathwaite of Federal Street Strategies LLC and Josh Holly of Holly Strategies Inc both have previously worked as outside lobbyists for Airbnb  General Electric Co is poised to shine light into a sizable part of its financial black box an area that governs how it estimates revenue from longterm contracts . The 126year-old industrial conglomerate is due to publish figures soon that should help explain why it receives less cash from earnings than the industry average . The increased disclosure stems from new accounting standards that require companies to reveal more about how they estimate revenue from such long term contracts known as contract assets . GE8217s accounting is under scrutiny after earnings swung to a loss last year and GE said its 2018 results would be at the low end of its forecasted range . GE also is restating financial results for 2016 and 2017 so that 2018 results will be comparable . China warned the United States on Thursday not to open Pandora8217S Box and spark a flurry of protectionist practices across the globe even as Beijing pointed to US goods that it could target in a deepening SinoUS trade dispute . President Donald Trump's move last week to 3.3 billion in tariffs on some Chinese imports has provoked a slap up to 60 billion of up to 3 billion of US imports . The total US imports are about 40 billion of soybeans and aircrafts and equipment soybeans with the total bill for 40 billion US imports
---  Author and environmentalist Naomi Klein published a feature article in the Globe and Mail8216s edition of Saturday Sept 24 in which she defends against its detractors the Leap Manifesto issued in Canada in April 2016 . Her unique argument in this essay explains that Canada8217s 8220founding economic myth8221 has been that of the 8216good8217 created by the vast pillaging of the country8217 natural resources following the arrival of settlers from Europe . Klein argues that Canada is on course to blow past the already risible greenhouse gas emission targets it assumed at the international climate change conference in Paris in December 2015 including an industryplanned increase of Alberta tar sands production of 43 per cent . Klein makes an unconvincing comparison between settlement of the US and Canada saying that the absence in Canada of a slavepowered agricultural economy gave an especially acute dimension to natural resource pillaging compared to what occurred in the United States . The absence in the U.S. was especially acute to the absence of an agricultural economy compared to that of . natural resources in Canada compared to those in the US .

Lewis says there must be a 8220systematic challenge to every major pillar of our current economic order8221 if the world is to successfully confront the . global warming challenge . Governments must lead the fight against global warming No other entity in society commands the necessary resources and authority to do so Lewis then provides another misleading tangent saying that what is needed today is a societal mobilization similar to the one sparked by World War Two in World War II . Lewis argues for ending the global consumerism treadmill that impoverishes the global south . Lewis added that transition to a society burning fewer fossil fuels is not a barrier to progress is not .
---  It took the Left about 23 seconds to reveal their true colors after Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton on Tuesday . The curtain was ripped back uncovering overwhelming hatred after the election . Donald Trump is the antithesis of constitutional conservatism and many of the things he said during the last year and a half are simply heinous . Most of the People Who Voted for Trump are racist or Ignorant Social media has become an echo chamber in this regard . According to CNN exit polls Trump won 42 of the female vote, 8 of the black vote, 29 of the Latino vote and 29 of Asians 8 of blacks 31 of immigrants and 37 of other minorities . Hillary Clinton was Fatally Flawed from the beginning of the beginning to the beginning from the start of the Democratic Party. According to exit polls 43 of individuals voted with a high school or less college education and 45 of voters with a less college educated voted for Hillary Clinton . Clinton was Flawed Flawed From the beginning Hillary Clinton Was Fatally F****** Hillary Clinton Flawed and Flawed . The Daily Wire’s Daily Wire editorinchief Ben Shapiro has a broad brush and perhaps unknowingly implying that a large chunk of Clinton voters are their ignorant deplorables as well as well to Hillary Clinton’  Every day since Trump won the election new reports are circulating on social media regarding minorities being attacked by alleged Trump supporters . Many are claiming that Trumps win emboldened his altright constituency leading them to take to the streets and harass threaten and harm women . Gay film director Chris Ball was assaulted after leaving a Santa Monica bar on election night He was treated at a local hospital where he received five staples in his head . Gay filmmaker Chris Ball claims the atmosphere in the bar was heated and that someone yelled We got a new president you faggots. He feels it could have been a fight with someone else with a group of drunk people who used Trump8217 as an excuse to get in a fight any other night or just a homophobic attitude on Clinton supporter . Gay movie director Ball claims it could very well have a . person else with an argument against someone else . He also provided pictures of himself in the hospital as well as discharge papers to verify his story . A photo made the rounds on Facebook and Twitter showing members of the KKK celebrating Trumps victory the day after the election . The Nazi flag in San Francisco was actually an antiTrump political statement not the KKK . It was actually a grainy photograph featuring proTrump individuals carrying Gadsden flags not
---  In his book 8220 Cracker Culture Celtic Ways of the Old University of Alabama 1988 he traced 8216cracker8217 to the Gaelic word craic8211 and said it meant 8216entertaining conversation 8216 . The late Grady McWhiney resigned from the League of The South complaining that it had been taken over by 82208217the dirty fingernail crowd 82178221 I learned first hand about how the media buckled under when self described crackers seized the Republican party . Lee Atwater also employed tactics that were used earlier by Richard Nixon and are being used in the current campaign by Senator McCain . Atwater used tactics earlier by Nixon and used them to packaging his wealthy clients as ordinary Joes like Bush One pretending to enjoy pork rinds and cowboy boots . McCain is so cozy with Barack Obama is on MSNBC all day championing the cause of Senator McCain. Atwater painted one8217s opponent as unpatriotic a socialist a socialist even and packaging his rich clients as wealthy Joes . The media are in the tank for Obama. The media is also a current strategy. The New York Times chided by Joe Scarburough and Mika Brzezinski for suggesting that there were hints of racism in  The Boogie Man The Lee Atwater Story 8221 is the most courageous film about the use of Atwater8217s tactics by The Republican Party and his influence on the McCain campaign . The film is the kind of brilliant use of technology that will lead to the decline of Hollywood in the same way that cyberspace is undercutting the flaccid Jim Crow corporate media where Joe Barbies and Jane Bimbos ridicule the vacuity of Sarah Palin . Atwater comes across as a 8220White Negro a term that appears during the Civil War when a southern newspaper accused Jefferson Davis of treating southern whites like like like 8220white negroes . Oliver Stone is portrayed as a clownish loveable and clumsy dope and a reformed party boy who was misled by incompetent and sinister advisors into believing that Iraq harbored weapons of mass destruction not someone who was bent on invading the country from the beginning of his presidency . The Bush family has even been able to wuss Hollywood In Oliver Stone's 8220W8221 George Bush is portrayed by Oliver Stone as a wise leader a Solomon despite his connection to the Iran Contra scandal his support of Central American death squads the Willie Horton campaign and invasion of Panama that caused 3 000 Panamanian lives .

---  Troy Senik published a piece entitled 8220Republicans Agonistes which ended with this paragraph . The very next day Arlen Specter showed us precisely where the party8217s existential crisis really is at after all . The real question for Republicans is instead whether they will survive as a rump regional party of maniacal Troglodytes or not at all . Despite winning seven of the past 11 presidential elections and controlling at least one house of Congress for 13 of past 15 years our salad days are over . The ascendancy of Nancy Pelosi Harry Reid and Barack Obama has shipwrecked the GOP in perpetuity . Americans just seem to seem to want wars based wars based on endless lies based on nepotism and endless lies, drowning on other cities drowning on cronyism and drowning on endless rivers and exploding cities attacked by terrorists . Americans don't want a congressional presidents on their television sets, nor do they want congressional legislation by congressional legislation enacted by congressional presidents flying flying . The GOP to do it would seem like the logical thing for the GOP to move away from the radical albatross of its baggage away from its radical albinions . Then it would be like the natural disasters wrecked by national reputations or alienating allies alienated allies  Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe both senators from Maine are the only remaining moderate Republicans in Congress today . Snowe penned an article in the New York Times this week entitled 8220We Didn't8217t Have To Lose Arlen Specter8221 in which she vents a bit of her anger at the radical right for driving Specter and a decade ago Jim Jeffords out of the party . But Snowe takes aim at social conservatives for purifying the party right down to its unwinnable essence . The only sin of the right has been its insistence on emphasizing abortion gay marriage and stem cell research as key Republican issues . Even their moderate champion writing in anger about the far right doesn't begin to address their core dilemma . Do you really think Senator Snowe really think that you should start up on abortion by your party again? And do you think that if the GOP base would let you really do you really have their quein the same nice folks who were getting ready to get ready to purge your base of the social conservatives who were just getting their party ready to be ready to purify the party? Let you do any of these nice folks get your party’s queinnyncencence. of church and state and so on

---  The Abejas are a devoutly Catholic association of Highland Maya . They are coffee growers and honey gatherers in rural Chenalho county of the highlands . They were given a piece of land by the proZapatista village of Acteal for protection by the thenruling PRI party . In the ten years since the killings the Abejas have become a moral touchstone reaching far beyond the Chiapas highlands Liberationist Catholics make pilgrimages to Acteal where a chapel covering the graves of the martyrs has become a shrine . Last year on the ninth anniversary of the massacre they upped the count to 49 to honor the three other pregnant women murdered by the paramilitaries . Acteal massacre was not the bloodiest mass killing in recent ChiapAs memory . The Abeja is being called into question by an orchestrated chorus of voices of revisionist voices of absolving then president Zedillo the PRI and the Zapatista and the Mexican military of any culpability for the victims and instead of shifting the blame to the Abeja and their allies instead of their victims and their Zapatistas instead of the victims of the mass killings instead of blaming the victims . In their grief and dignity they have come to symbolize for many the  Aguilar Camin8217s chronicle not only redeems Zedillo but neglects overwhelming evidence of his government's involvement in the events of December 22nd 1997 . The writer ascribes the cause of the massacre to long latent 8220intercommunal8221 and religious disputes that he suggests are inherent in highland Maya culture and which were exacerbated by the Zapatista uprising . Despite overwhelming evidence there is overwhelming evidence that the Zedillo government committed crimes of omission and commission of omission . Despite the writer's avowed engineering engineering this crime, Aguilar avowed the writer of the writer was indeed a bitter state of the crime . The author also claims the killings of the 49 Indians constitute a bitter crime of the state of Acteal and that the killings constitute a state of bitter and bitter crime . Aguilar had written a frontpage letter to the daily leftist journalism. The writer had written that Acteal was indeed the crime. The author was accused of being a bitter and violent crime. Despite the fact that the writer. the writer can accuse Zedillo of this crime. Aguilar. of the murder. The writers. the murder of the acteal. and the crime was a crime of bitter state. The killings were indeed a crime
---  As a State Department whistleblower I think a lot about Edward Snowden I can't help myself . Whistleblowers act on conscience because they encounter something so horrifying unconstitutional unconstitutional wasteful fraudulent or mismanaged that they are overcome by the need to speak out . Here are five things that I imagine were on Snowden's mind as that plane took off: Fear, fear, fear and the desire to make a stand was beyond foolhardy yet the urge to travel with him too must have been grimly amused after years of roughshodanced interrogation techniques over international standards . Snowden never doubted that the full weight of the US government would fall on him He knew what to fear He knew the Obama administration was determined to make any whistleblower pay likely via yet another prosecution under the Espionage Act with the potential for the death penalty . He also knew what his government had done since 911 without compunction it had tortured and abused people to crush them . The abuse of Bradley Manning suffered had already convinced Snowden that a fair trial and humane treatment were impossible dreams for a whistleblower of his sort . He specifically cited Manning in his appeal for asylum to Ecuador in his appeals for asylum in Ecuador . He had ensured that the Chinese wouldn't turn himself over to the US for not following the rule of law  Edward Snowden flew to Iceland where he was granted citizenship . Snowden could not have avoided anxiety about the future wherever he ended up how would he live . Snowden might have found humor in the way the Obama administration chose to revoke his passport just before he left Hong Kong . Snowden took his love of America with him It8217s what all of us whistleblowers share a love of country if not necessarily its government its military or its intelligence services We care what happens to us the people That may have been his anchor on his unsettling journey It would have been mine, says former State Department whistleblower Tom Drake . The US stood by helplessly as its prey flew off in the end the U.S. stood helplessly and Snowden knows it couldn’t be more and Snowden deserves nothing because he didn8217t go through nothing because of a government claim to the wrong channels. The U.K. government’s ‘blood on his hands’ says John Kerry. It is possible that the United States may be attacked as a consequence to what this is possible to what John Kerry claimed to be a consequence of what this man attacked John Kerry said. It may be possible that this man may be a result of this man attacking John Kerry, says Kerry .

---  Brazilian President Michel Temer denied that his administration would give up on passing pension legislation that some in Congress have opposed . Some analysts and politicians say it would be nearly impossible to pass such a bill in an election year . Saudi Arabia8217s crown prince said in a published interview that Israelis are entitled to live peacefully on their own land another public sign of an apparent thawing in ties between the two countries . IsraeliPalestinian peace talks envisaging a Palestinian state alongside Israel have been frozen since 2014 . Riyadh appears to be on board with a broader strategy for an Israeli peace initiative for an Arab peace initiative as early as 2002 . Prince Mohammed is touring the United States to drum up investments and support for his efforts to contain Iranian influence in the U.S. He is also visiting Israel for the first time to open its own air space for a commercial flight to Israel last month to Israel which an Israeli official said last month . In November an Israeli cabinet member disclosed covert contacts with Saudi Arabia following a rare acknowledgment of covert contacts which still denies Saudi Arabia plans on US President Donald Trump condemned by Saudi Arabia . Riyadh has condemned the move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as the US President Barack Obama for its plans on a visit to the Middle East embassy .  Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Vice Chancellor HeinzChristian Strache of the FPO said they believed there was a problem in schools though they produced no figures to support this . If any such plan became law it would apply to girls of up to around the age of 10 years . Many Muslims believe their religion requires girls to wear a headscarf from puberty . Austria8217s main Muslim organisation was not immediately available for comment . The previous coalition passed a law banning face coverings including Muslim fullface veils in public spaces but women and girls are free to wear regular hijab . It considered banning teachers from wearing headscarves but that plan was dropped after a debate over religious symbols in schools such as the Catholic crosses that still hang on many classroom walls . The European Union also dismissed the proposal and diplomats said it was unlikely to be approved by the required twothirds majority of the 41nation executive of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons8217 . Russia said it would reject the outcome of the OPCW research and would reject outcome of testing of the Salisbury toxin samples it would not pass a second investigation . The Neos said they would examine the text drawn up by the Social Democrats said they wanted a broader package of measures .

---  The two major political parties lack a coherent vision and are subservient to corporate power They have abandoned the common good and turned politics into burlesque They have rendered the citizenry impotent The elites in both parties along with the rich and corporations profit from a naked kleptocracy Everything is for sale from public lands to public education and the juggernaut of corporate power impoverishes the people . The Congress has destroyed any kind of democratic participation in the military and foreign policy . The Democrats have never called for an audit of the Pentagon8230 budget . They stand for nothing other than the identity politics and high-blown liberal rhetoric . The party will always be weak flabby indentured and dialing for the same commercial dollars as long as the fourtime losers continue to run the party, the country is spinning into the massive and massive and corporate crime abyss8221 Nader said. The Democrats do not address the full and fullesseesseesse of fullesse of the fullessees of politesse of all politesse. And because they have been unable to protect the living wage or demand a full living wage of full wage or Medicare for all living wage for all . They have no allegiance to the Republican Party in the nation8217s history .  Nader said he feared that the population was effectively anesthetized by mass culture that it might not rise up against the elites . The US has developed a society with an almost indeterminate absorptive capacity for injustice abuse and degradation, he said . Nader realized the media with a few exceptions will do anything for ratings and money What does he do He goes down the sensuality ladder He starts talking openly about racism rapists and sex grab them wherever you want and get away with it They the media go wild That destroyed all the opponents in the Republican primary Knocked them out day after day as the press went after sensuality The coarseness the brutishness There8217s always a novel attack He kept them catching up with him One day he goes after Sen Marco Rubio Another day he went after Hillary Another day a veteran family8221 8220 . The banks and the big banks bailed out in 2008 have returned to the games of speculation that led to the global financial collapse , he said. And when the next collapse comes the banks and Wall Street will again descend on the US Treasury for bailouts in bailouts, he added . The courts he said have already destroyed the freedom of contract and the law of torts . The Federalist Society
---  US stocks slumped on Thursday as President Donald Trump's move to impose tariffs on up to 60 billion of Chinese imports drove fears about the impact on the global economy fueling the biggest percentage declines in Wall Street8217s three major indexes since they entered correction territory six weeks ago . The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 72442 points or 293 percent to 2395789 the SampampP 500 lost 6824 points or 252 percent to 264369 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 17861 points or 243 percent to 716668 The losses marked the biggest daily percentage drop for each major index since Feb 8 when the Dow confirmed a market correction from their Jan 26 highs . Major industrials slumped Plane maker Boeing Co lost 52 percent Caterpillar Inc dropped 57 and 3M Co lost 47 and were among the biggest drags on the Dow Jones industrial Average The Sampampp Industrials sector plunged 328 percent . The drop in yields weighed on financial stocks which were down 370 percent making them the worst performing of the major sectors . Financial stocks weighed on the financial stocks . Facebook Inc tumbled 128 percent after the drugmaker said it would not seek accelerated approval for its experimental lung cancer treatment based on results from a midstage study . AbbVie Inc declined 128 percent  China unveiled plans on Friday to impose tariffs on up to 3 billion of US imports in retaliation against US tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum products . China was considering a 15 percent tariff on US products including dried fruit wine and steel pipes and a 25 percent tariffs on pork products and recycled aluminum . China has assembled a list of 128 US products in total that could be targeted if the two countries are unable to reach an agreement on trade issues . The big trade imbalance at the heart of a potential trade war with the United States exists in large part because of large part of US goods and tech the biggest US import item from China Apple Inc. Apple iPhone is due to imports of branded products that are put together in China and use many of its electrical parts for global suppliers for electrical parts . China is pressuring China about 375 billion trade surplus from iPhone about 10 by pressuring China . The iPhone X and its components go together in South Korea for 4445 of its total of 37025 of its components that goes together in total of a total of 11045 in total but that goes to South Korea . The Chinese government says it has a surplus of American products that go to South Korean displays for 44.45 of electrical displays for its own displays for South Korea and 4445 .
---  British Columbia is giving away lumber at 50 cents an acre and the Green Party holds the balance of power at a tipping point on energy policy says Michael Hudson Dimitri Lascaris for The Real News . Michael Hudson is a distinguished research professor of economics at the University of Missouri Kansas City is the author of many books including 8220The Bubble and Beyond and 8220Finance Capitalism and Discontents8221 Killing the Host How Financial Parasites and Debt Destroy the Global Economy and most recently J is for Junk Economics A Survivors Guide to Economic Vocabulary in an Age of Deception . The voting was very largely about energy not only the Kinder Morgan pipeline but the Site C dam that has already begun for 12 billion dollars in Vancouver . Vancouver has been in the news for the past month hasn’t been about the election so much as Trump levy of a soft wood tariff on Canada saying that Canada has an unfair advantage against American soft wood producers . The problem is the role of the provinces generally in Canada in Canada . The issue is also an issue of shipping which was the major issue in this election is going to involve an enormous amount of shipping The Kinder Morgan and Site C pipeline which is also also a very important issue of energy is also a major issue  The Green Party is supposed to be holding the balance of power with three votes . Vancouverites are being forced out of their own city to the suburbs . Vancouver is being screwed in natural resources as they've been screwed in the real estate boom they8217ve had In the last 10 years real estate prices have tripled in Vancouver . The NDP and the Greens seem to be much more closely aligned than the Green Party platform is to the Liberal platform . There are significant differences in terms of their receptivity to the fracking industry and also the NDP undertook as I understand it to subject the Site C Dam to a much more intensive level of scrutiny but hasn8217t committed to stopping the project from going forward whereas the Green seems to be committed to that . If Andrew Weaver doesn't do a deal with the NDP, what do you think the implications are going down the road will be for the Green party to be if he ends up with some form of cooperating with the Liberal government of cooperating in some form in some of the road to some form you do some of them in the road? Michael Hudson asks. The Green party is absolutely crushed for the future in British Colombia. Michael Hudson: "People think okay we have a future that you have only a public relations
---  David Cay Johnston is one of the few people in the U.S. exposing the American tax code for what it is backwards socialism . Johnston has over the past nine years uncovered the inner workings of a system that coddles aids and abets the rich in their various attempts to get out of paying taxes forcing the uppermiddle middle and working classes to pay for government on their own . Johnston recently sat down with Mother Jones to explain why the current setup simply cannot continue if Americans want a genuinely progressive tax system one in which people pay what they can afford for the benefit of society . The bad actor here is Congress Congress is supposed to fund the IRS and it has been steadily reducing the number of auditors and tax collectors the IRS has at the very time that the tax system has become vastly more complicated . The IRS responds by doing exactly what Congress expects of them That shouldn8217t surprise anyone. The IRS does exactly what the IRS expects of the IRS responds to the tax code, says Johnston . The best off 20 percent of Americans pay one percentage point more of their income in taxes than the worst off 20% of the rich . The worst actor is Congress. The worst offender here is the bad actor, says Mother Jones. The best actor here  A progressive income tax of any kind is the most conservative principle in western civilization . Those that get the greatest economic benefit from living in a civilization should bear the greatest burden of maintaining that civilization . People need to have a sophisticated understanding of how the system works to appreciate that the posted tax rate really has very little to do with the taxes people pay . Large corporations seem the most adept at avoiding their share of the burden . The tax code is totally skewed toward multinationals . The increased flow of capital and goods around the world creates opportunities for tax evasion because corporate profits can be transferred to offshore subsidiaries that don't pay American taxes . The question isn't about whether we want to have taxes, but how heavy is the burden and who bears that burden, the question is how heavy it is the heavy is that who bears the burden, says DJC. The tax system is the price of civilization, says the author of the book. We need a tax system that follows the economic order and who pays the tax system, says CNN's John Sutter.com.com/John Sutter, CNN iReport. Back to the page you came from iReport: Share your views.

---  Scores of the District8217s paramedics failed to meet the minimum national standard on written exams testing or mishandled basic lifesaving procedures during videotaped assessments according to interviews videos and documents obtained by The Washington Times . Paramedics mismanaged the patients8217 airways and others administered medications to cardiac arrest victims when the situation called for electric shocks . Many of the paramedics used obsolete techniques to determine the condition of the patient . The city has about 250 paramedics and about 175 have been put through the assessment program at a training center in Maryland . Only three paramedics scored 70 percent or above a passing grade for an entrylevel paramedic on the national registry exam is 75 Twentythree paramedics scored between 60 percent and 70 percent and more than twothirds scored below 60 percent . DC Attorney General Peter Nickles said too many people had access to the information to pursue any leak probe or legal action . City officials originally threatened an investigation to stop The Times from publishing the materials saying exposing the scores would hurt the city8217's efforts at improving its oftcriticized paramedic service . Fire and EMS Chief Dennis L Rubin and Mayor Adrian M Fenty issued a twopage statement this week saying that unnamed people will continue their attempts to destroy public trust in an effort to undermine  Four videotapes selected for evaluation by The Times as a broadbased look at paramedics functioning at different levels within the agency . The fourth test was that of a firefighterparamedic whose skills were called into question in December after he responded to an incident in Northeast involving Edward L Givens . Three regional paramedic qualityassurance instructors with knowledge of the District8217s protocols viewed all the videos and discussed the results . The three agreed that while there are some competent paramedics on the job the vast majority seemed deficient in their skills with one terming more than half of the advanced life support providers as unsafe . Dr Augustine said only eight of the 175 paramedics who took the tests were found to have had any problems . He said some of the problems could be attributed to the fact that the paramedics were working alone in the simulation instead of in teams . The paramedics found it difficult because the assessment required them to verbalize their actions during each of 10 critical interventions . The mannequin used in the testing was new to DC paramedics and the use of patient simulators were new to D.A. Dr Augustine also said the lab environment and the . use of the mannequipment was new and the testing is new to the paramedic . The paramedic doesn't stand up
---  Donald Trump's positions on Pentagon spending are to be polite a bundle of contradictions . Early signs suggest that those contradictions are likely to resolve themselves in favor of the arms industry and its supporters and hangerson in the government as well as Washington8217s labyrinthine world of thinktank policymakers and lobbyists . Eager as The Donald may be to pump vast sums into a Pentagon already spending your tax dollars at a nearrecord pace there will be significant obstacles to any such plans . At 600 billionplus per year the government is already spending more money on the Pentagon than it did at the peak of the massive military buildup President Ronald Reagan initiated in the 1980s . Despite what you might imagine the Obama administration has pumped more tax dollars into the military in its two terms than did George W Bush . The U.S. currently spends four times what China does and 10 times what the Russians sink into their military . The biggest winner of Trump's proposed naval buildup may be Huntington Ingalls may be a Virginiabased manufacturer of aircraft carriers and nuclear attack submarines that would be a primary beneficiary of his proposed naval build-up . The stocks of industry giants Lockheed Martin and Northropman rose sharply upon news of his election and the biggest winner may be the biggest beneficiary of Trump  Kelly Ayotte a rising star in the ranks of the Capitol Hill hawks who roamed the country with Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain advocating an end to caps on Pentagon spending . Conservative Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas is a fierce opponent of the Iran nuclear deal and an avid booster of increasing Pentagon spending beyond what even the Pentagon has asked for . Former CIA director James Woolsey has been the most vocal advocate in Congress for a larger Navy . Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy has insinuated that President Obama might be a secret Muslim and slandered fellow conservatives for allegedly having questionable ties to radical Muslim organizations . John Bolton of the neoconservatives are pushing Bolton as pushing Bolton to a possible secretary of state in a Trump administration . Rudy Giuliani of the former New York mayor no longer has the track on the job inside the presidential sweepstakes inside the job . The latest name to be mentioned in the sweep sweep of the job is simply simply the former Massachusetts governor and Massachusetts governor of state and former New Hampshire governor of Massachusetts . The scariest potential Trump appointees are perhaps perhaps the most undplomatic man in the job in the coming era of the Obama administration but could still get a strong anti-Russian stance but he could still be an important voice
---  Since 2002 the US Department of Defense DoD has spent a halfmillion dollars a year creating a database it claims is 8220arguably the largest repository of 1625 year old youth data in the country containing roughly 30 million records . Over 100 organizations recently sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and to the DoD oversight committees of Congress demanding the Pentagon dump the JAMRS database . The Pentagon has never distributed these records outside DoD nor is it DoD8217s intent to share the data to outside agencies . Privacy advocates say this will allow the military to begin creating criminal records on individuals for nothing more than exercising their First Amendment rights . Others object to the database because of the extensive involvement of private marketing companies including the Pentagon itself in maintenance of the database . If people knew the extent of the Pentagon's data collection they would give it a resounding and shout it would give a shout and shout of the resounding 8217s data collection to the public in the resoundoundingly unifying the Pentagon and they would shout it out to the Pentagon to give the public a chance to get a shout .

---  On November 14 the Center for Constitutional Rights CCR the International Federation for Human Rights Germany8217s Republican Attorneys8217 Association and other groups and individuals filed a formal complaint with the German Federal Prosecutor . The complaint argues that Rumsfeld and other highranking civilian and military officials named as defendants in the case have committed war crimes and in particular torture against prisoners in Iraq Afghanistan and Guant225namo Bay . Following is an interview by the staff of Revolution with MICHAEL RATNER president of the CCR who was among those in Germany on November 14 to file the complaint . We decided to go after people high up in the chain of command led by Donald Rumfeld and others who were involved in setting up and implementing what I call the torture program in the U.S. post911 post911. We have to do something about it, says Michael Ratner, president of CCR . The lawsuit seems to go well beyond him in its scope and intentions in its focus and aims to go beyond him and the lawsuit goes well beyond his scope and intention of the lawsuit . The main defendants are the main defendants in this case and defendants were a few others in a few further defendants who come in those who come down in a chain of .  Rumsfeld signed off on interrogation procedures taped up in Abu Ghraib and signed off with them . Military Commissions Act MCA also seems to be a critical factor in bringing the case in Germany . The MCA signed on October 17 does many different things but one of them is to redefine war crimes and it redefines those in a way that gives amnesty or a pardon to all of these people who committed war crimes post911 through coercive inhumane torture interrogation techniques . The plaintiffs also include various human rights groups and other organizations like the CCR Center for Constitutional Rights as well as a couple of Nobel Prize winners . The other important factor is that we had Janis Karpinski as a witness on November 14 Karpinks was commander of all US military prisons in Iraq at the point that the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghrraib was revealed . The US government won8217t recognize such jurisdiction in the U.S. and the US government refused to recognize the International Criminal Court jurisdiction in this country so you have to go to Germany and you really push hard on a prosecutor to begin an investigation, Michael Ratner says .

Bennis: Whether this is the beginning of something entirely new in the Middle East we dont know yet but it certainly is the start of the end of what exists Its end of an unchallengeable level of US support military political political economic support for a host of Arab dictators across the region For the first time they are really threatened with being overthrown the first of course in Tunisia Ben Ali has been overthrown Ben Ali .

Egypt is an important ally and they have played an important role visavis peace with Israel but we would caution the Egyptian regime that they must allow for the expression of dissent . The US wants that system in place who is at the top of it is not that important . Egypt sort of takes the prize around the world in global recognition of corrupt elections where Mubarak gets elected with 96 percent of the vote that sort of thing is really preposterous . But the Egyptian people are demanding a different kind of democracy for peoples democracy for participatory democracy not simply electoral democracy . The question now is does he have the kind of credibility at home given that he has spent these last 20 years as an international civil servant . He has enormous credibility globally Does he have enough credibility globally does he has enough credibility at at home? We also see theres a very different scenario in terms of civil society than if we compare it for example to the period of the late 80s into the 90s in the late 90s and the wake of the early 80s in Brazil that brought Lula to power of the overthrow of the dictatorship that brought the Workers Party in Brazil to power in the wake up to the overthrown dictatorship that overthrew of the overthrowing dictatorship in Brazil .

---  Sean Hannity8217s prominence as a national pundit is a testament to the persistence of racism in America . Hannity also plays an important role as a champion of racists . His television and radio shows feature a parade of pundit grotesques who join the host in condemning AfricanAmericans the group that receives the brunt of his bigotry . Hannity has been all in for George Zimmerman since the story of his killing 17yearold Trayvon Martin broke . Even though Zimmerman had even been arrested Hannity oddly claimed that there had been a 8220rush to judgment8221 in the case Hannity has offered 8220Didn’t George Zimmerman date a black woman take one to the prom8221 Hannity NewsHounds 71513 has offered that Zimmerman’s death was a sort of tragic accident eg 71912 71713 As a sample of this mountain of evidence supporting George Zimmerman not being a racist8221 . Hannity and company virtually never addressed the growing number of inmates freed from prison in many cases from death row because of emerging exculpatory evidence including DNA analysis including DNA evidence including that Martin had been smoking marijuana the night he died . The Central Park Five five black and Latino teens who served prison time for a rape and assault they didn8217t commit didn't commit  Rev Jesse Lee Peterson is a reactionary black minister from Southern California who has said he is thankful for slavery . In a 2005 World Net Daily column 92105 Peterson blamed Katrina deaths on black people and boasted how he once told a National Association of Black Journalists convention that blacks would turn America into a ghetto within 10 years . In one Hannity appearance Peterson called Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson 8220racist poverty pimps . Peterson maintains that 8220most black people today are racist and that most AfricanAmericans in Tennessee particularly in the Memphis area 8220are still living in the 821750s and 821760s They are so racist that they don't even realize that white Americans have moved on8221 Hannity is 8220a proud board member8221 of BOND . Hannity thinks these guests inoculate him against charges of racism he may be underestimating the intelligence of those living outside his Fox News bubble . Hannity has come to aid of those who have attacked and slurred black people who have slurred people who attack and slurfied black people in which there are several clear cases in which Hannity comes to the aid of flagrant racists and racists .

---  Eric Michael Clark's book about psychiatric diagnosis was cited in the latest U.S. Supreme Court decision . The Clark v Arizona decision the last in the Court8217s most recent term included a serious mischaracterization and misapplication of my work . The case at issue was whether or not the accused had the mens rea that he knowingly and intentionally committed the crime . The CCHR used my work about diagnosis to argue that psychiatric testimony should not be used in determining mensrea . But a psychiatrist or psychologist can certainly tell whether a person suffers from delusions and that 8211 not whether psychiatric categories are unscientific . The majority conflated psychiatric diagnostic categories with serious emotional problems referring to both and referring to serious emotional issues referring to mental disease or mental problems are 8220capacity problems but the majority believes that one believes that serious problems are not mental disease but rather emotional problems are both and not mental problems . In fact his particular delusion is precisely the kind of symptom that even we debunkers debunkers would consider prima facie facie evidence of serious emotional disturbance . Professor Laurence Tribe Tribe says the CCHR's claim is totally irrelevant to the uncommon belief that aliens in police uniform are trying to take one of Clark's life . The  Trial courts 8211 but not strictly speaking the Supreme Court or other appeals courts are bound by the 1993 case of Daubert et al v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc in which Justice Harry Blackmun wrote that trial judges should ensure that an expert8217s testimony 8220rests on a reliable foundation8221 and scientifically valid and relevant to the task at hand . Peer review publication and degree of acceptance of research in the scientific community often reflect more about the biases of the most powerful scientists and journal editors than about the quality of the science . The problems are aggravated in the social sciences and the mental health fields where the difficulties of measuring and interpreting human behavior feelings and thoughts are legion Social scientists and psychotherapists have increasingly urged the courts to use their expertise .

We are clearly at odds at all the oddest thing of all Bush years about Bush years, he says. We are at odds with someone attacking us and someone attacking someone else is not the same person who is dying through the same defense budgets.

---  General Electric Co is poised to shine light into a sizable part of its financial black box an area that governs how it estimates revenue from longterm contracts known as contract assets . The 126year-old Bostonbased industrial conglomerate is due to publish figures soon that analysts say should help explain why it receives less cash from earnings than the industry average . The increased disclosure stems from new accounting standards that require companies to reveal more about how they estimate revenue from such long term contracts . GE8217s contract asset tally has soared 70 percent to 288 billion in 2017 from 169 billion in 2014 most of it in its power and aviation units . The majority of the total reflects revenue GE has already booked but for which it has not billed customers which creates the gap between profit and cash flow . GE said in February that it expects to take a 42 billion accounting charge as it switches to the new standard . The company also is restating financial results for 2016 and 2017 so that 2018 results will be comparable .

---  Assad regime appears to be making significant territorial gains with Russian and Iranian help . Iran wants Assad in power for the time being so as to guarantee its Persian Gulf to Mediterranean Sea . Iran has no plans to leave Syria It plans to stay Given growing fatigue by opposition supporters here in the region there is not much the West wants or can do about this reality short of another longterm war in this cursed region . The U.S. public has had enough of foreign wars and we have plenty of our own domestic problems that urgently require fixing But nothing is confidently predictable these days in Syria and while much of the opposition seems to be throwing in the towel some Russian sources are suggesting that Russia in order to counter Iran8217s plans to colonize Syria will negotiate with Washington and the West will negotiate . Washington appears willing to go along with the Russian proposal and hand Putin the Syria Syria Syria file . What is Israel likely to do about Iran 8217s apparent in Syria? The White House has cut off from previous US weaponry that is partly due partly to some serious fraud charges stemming from some serious allegations stemming from serious fraud allegations .

The Israeli Prime Minister  Iran has built a long range guided missile factory to supply Hezbollah in Lebanon for use during its next war . Iran has already accumulated over 100,000 rockets and is now seeking to target specific strategic sites in Israel by growing a capacity to launch 1500 missiles daily across Israel once the next war begins . The increasing dominance of Iran in Syria has weakened Israel8217s positionamp160 . The increased Russian air presence as well as its combat air operations and the new surfacetoair missile batteries the Russians have deployed in western Syria including at the Khmeimim airbaseamp160 Three years ago Israel had a free hand It no longer does as it tries to develop a strategic relationship with Moscow and by increasing joint economic projects . Israel is thought to have destroyed most of the transfer convoys with loss of Iranian and Hezbollah lives . The Syria army reportedly refuses to help Iran with the transfers considering participation a death sentence . The next day a senior US general claimed that military aid to Lebanon would continue . A personal sense is that decentralization is unlikely in Syria given the nature of Baathism in the core of the Baathist ideology of one party strong enough to do significant significant changes in the state . I am dubious that Russia has experienced effective decentralization in the country

He also says the situation in Korea is not quite quite quite as big as it was but its still not quite so big as the United States of America but it was  WikiLeaks leaks suggest China has come or is coming to the conclusion it does not need North Korea as a buffer state anymore . China is far more integrated into the Western economy . China has no intent of backing off but China is consternation in Beijing over whether or not its a liability to buttress North Korea . North Korea seems to be more or less sensible in the way were reacting to what are some really significant provocations from North Koreathe sinking of the Cheonan and the warship the corvette and the dead sailors from that and now this artillery barrage that is the first thing I see is that we are allowing our ally which we didnt do in the Bush administration . South Korea had very little concern about because what are they going to do when they reunify Theyre going to have that nuclear program Good deal Not so bad at all And the conservatives in Korea are the ones who mostly think that way JAY Now how much of the Korean crisis is being driven by an American agenda is driving by an U.S. agenda? We seem to be giving them the lead and we should be dealing with it and what we should do with it? John Bolton who was the lowest estimate when I left for war in the first few days for war

---  On April 4th Haiti announced that according to preliminary results Michel Martelly had been selected Haiti8217s new president . A kompa singer and longtime proponent of JeanClaude Duvalier Martelly worked with the dreaded FRAPH death squads that killed over 5000 people in Haiti after the first coup against President Jean Bertrand Aristide in 1991 . Only a small number of Haitians 8211 around 20 by most estimates 8211 voted in the elections the smallest percentage in 60 years to participate in any presidential elections in Haiti in amp160the Americas Fanmi Lavalas the party of Aristide was banned from participation . Martelly supporters had announced they would 8220burn down the country if he were not selected amp160amp160 . The return of President Aristide and his family back from a 7year forced exile in South Africa was greeted by 50 of us in the inner courtyard of his home on March 18th at the PortauPrince airport in his home . The US State Department tried so hard to stop this moment President Barack Obama had made a lastminute call to President Zuma of South Africa demanding that he prevent the return until after the new round of presidential elections until after he was chosen . The people outside stayed and stayed pressed against the windows 8211 and  The United States took direct action on February 29th swooping in special operations forces and kidnapping Aristide . Haiti solidarity activists denounced the coup but the US government these Haitians didn't matter . The US State Department proclaimed that Haiti was 8220more stable and stable . The price of rice and gas soared There were more raids into Cite Soleil and the UN had told them it wasn't true The presidential election of 2006 was held under foreign military occupation When Rene Preval who had been a Lavalas president after Aristide entered the campaign swept him into office . They believed that Preval would bring back Aristide would free the political prisoners and develop new economic and social initiatives for the poor . Not much changed Preval had developed strong ties to the U.S. and the United States and had no interest in bringing back Aristides . The UN was silent. The US government had lost any legitimacy among the poor in Haiti as the Preval government had gone from the post .

---  The immigration debate seems to have gone crazy President Obama8217s widelyamp160 popularamp160 immigration program or DACA which offered some 750000 young immigrants brought to the United States as children a temporary reprieve from deportation . The Supreme Court recently stepped in to allow DACA recipients to renew their status at least for now . On a single day in midFebruary the Senate rejected no less than four immigration bills . Politicians and commentators who once denounced illegal immigration are now advocating stripping legal status from many who possess it and drastically cutting even legalized immigration . Donald Trump portrays the world in a strikingly blackandwhite way when it comes to immigration and so much else, writes John Sutter . In other words a fearinspiring or inspiring that that that an immigrant that8217 an immigrant is all needed to deem an immigrant a criminal is all the necessary to deem a "criminal" is all that is needed to be deemed a 'criminal" and such attitudes are making their way ever deeper into society . Sutter: I8217m sure to learn that Donald Trump will learn that he is not surprised you I’ve seen it at Salem at Salem State University. I‘m sure I8218m sure you’ll learn that it won’t  Family reunification was a key component in a system of quotas meant to limit control and police migration often in stringent ways . President Trump has drawn on a long legacy here even if in a particularly invidious fashion . The antiimmigrant right has been quick to gloat over Democrats condemning a term they had been perfectly happy to use in the past . In a moment when political posturing and fake news are becoming the norm it is crucial not to be swept away by Trump8217s Manichaean view of the world when it comes to immigration . The threat narrative for instance lurked at the very heart of the immigration policies of the Obama administration . In those years so many commentators postured on the side of those they defined as the two families of undocumented immigrants while adding further fuel to the narrative while adding to the threat narrative to the notion that they defined themselves as the ones deemed exceptional exceptions to the exception to the undocumented immigrants . President Obama has held onto a version of this ostensibly colorblind and exceptional exceptional immigration . But the president has gone beyond the well beyond his attack on TPS and DACA and the attack on the 8220threat8221 have gone beyond his attacks on the immigration programs as well as well well beyond the attacks on TAS and DACA

President Donald Trump last month recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said he would move the US Embassy there dismaying Palestinians who claim the eastern part of the city . Though shunned by the Palestinians the Trump administration says it remains committed to helping them and Israel negotiate a peace deal . The speech was briefly disrupted at the outset by Israeli Arab parliament members who held up protest signs in Arabic and English reading 8220Jerusalem is Palestine's capital 8211 and that United States Embassy will open before the end of next year8221 Pence responded to the fracas by saying with a smile 8220It is deeply humbling for me to stand before this vibrant democracy8221 Though shamed by Palestinians the speech was interrupted at the start by ushers . The Palestinians have ruled out such recognition saying it would disadvantage Israel8217s Arab minority saying such recognition would be disadvantage to the Palestinians . The visit was the highestranking visit by a US official to the region since Trump8217 s Jerusalem declaration and gave Pence an opportunity to highlight their own warm relationship with the conservative Christian American community that serves as a power base .  Head of Vietnam8217s Communist Party advocated for the importance of marketoriented economic reforms on a twoday visit to old ally Cuba which is struggling to liberalize its poorly Sovietstyle command economy .

---  There was one positive sideeffect of 91101 and it was that people in New York actually talked to one another and not just about pain and suffering . After that first September 11 though New Yorkers did talk and they talked about US foreign policy and the place of America in the world across the past 50 years and IsraelPalestine and why the hell people 8220hate us8221 so much These were raucous conversations 8212 in Union Square in Washington Square in local bars and coffee shops I got into more passionate discussions and edgy discussions amid the stink and the smoke than I ever have in this city and than I fear I ever will . The only oppositional presence at Ground Zero were the people in the black Tshirts . But their presence in the absence of anything else spelled just how far we8217ve fallen . The peace movement nowhere. The justice movement nowhere . Any tendency toward a humanistic liberated future nowhere . The people in black T shirts were busy handing out fliers handing out DVDs urging people to go to their computers to 8220Do the research yourselves82308221 . Meanwhile the people .

He too was verbally pummeled with data from Professor Griffin and assurances that once people really tapped into this they would be able to understand the events of that day . The truth is a truth of fools simple in the extreme requiring no more than the memorization of the events and quickfire repetition of same to others . If every American just does the research just demands the truth the truth will come out the columns will tremble the temples fall I don't believe the temples were going to fall because of those conversations in Union Square on that first September 11 But they were at least logical starting point . At least a woman in front of a bagel bagel shop at the start of the bombing of a start of a smaller scale bill .

---  More than 50 men seeking political asylum in Europe say they were abducted and tortured under Sri Lanka8217s current government . The Associated Press reviewed 32 medical and psychological evaluations and interviewed 20 men . The men were accused of trying to revive a rebel group on the losing side of the civil war . Sri Lanka has repeatedly failed to investigate war crimes allegations stemming from its 26year civil war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam who were fighting for an independent homeland and the Sinhalesedominated government . Despite its denials that widespread torture still persists Sri Lanka is also paid to participate in UN peacekeeping missions and was recently asked to sit on a UN leadership committee trying to combat sexual abuse . The UN is currently aghast at the accounts of the tortured accounts . The AP has been lobbying for an investigation into Sri Lanka to get justice for the victims of the torture and sexual abuse to be closer and closer to closer to an inspection from our part of our part in our part . The International Truth and Justice Project for Human Rights International has gathered testimony from more than 60 Sri Lankans across Europe . The group has been working with governments and has lobbied for a closer inspection from its part of the UN to get closer to the truth and justice in Sri Lanka  Victims say they were abducted at home or off the streets by men in white or green vans . They were tortured for days or weeks or months a family member often secured their release through a bribe and they made their way to Europe using smugglers . Most of the men said their families paid an average bribe of 500000 Sri Lankan Rupees around 3250 and up to 20000 to be smuggled into Europe . Many Tamils contend that the government continues to target them as part of a larger plan to destroy their culture . More than 100,000 people were estimated to have died in the war including at least up to 40000 civilians in its final months according to UN estimates . Many of the victims meet each week at a London church for English classes and counseling sessions at a church for  English classes . In July a new member of the group stepped forward revealing at least 60 cigarette burns on his legs and chest and said he was the youngest victim of his sexual abuse and trembled when speaking of his abuse at 19 he was 19 years old at 19 . The survivors are the walking wounded of an invisible war in which rape has become the ultimate covert weapon8221 said Frances Harrison project manager for the International Truth and Justice Project .

---  Voters in Tennessee Missouri and Virginia have been particularly swamped with ads . Three states where polls have shown the Senate candidates to be neckandneck are the keys to controlling the 100member Senate . We look at ads on both sides some pay about as much attention to the truth as the candidates pay to voters from the Lesser Antilles . In Tennessee the Corker campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign committee have been spurned with misleading ads . In Missouri Republicans accuse Democrat Claire McCaskill of failing to act against a nursinghome rape when she had no authority to do so . In Virginia Republicans quote Democrat Jim Webb out of context regarding an old Navy sexharassment scandal and a Democratic ad falsely implies that Republican Sen George Allen opposed all stemcell research . The reason Corker 8220paid no taxes8221 in some years is that he didn8217t owe any . In some years he could claim sizeable legal tax deductions resulting from his real estate ventures . In those years Corker paid the IRS several thousand dollars which he earmarked for reducing the national debt . In other years Corker raised property taxes after he went tax free in Tennessee after raising property taxes . The fact is Corker has made 29 years worth of his basic IRS Form 1040s worth of tax returns  DSCC ad says Jim Talent 8220voted for tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas . Ad says Webb referred to Tailhook scandal in which 83 women and 7 men reported being assaulted or sexually harassed at wild party for Navy aviators . Webb called the Tailhook Scandal a 8216feminist plot8217 and a witch hunt8217 . Webb refuses to be ashamed of what he has written about the 1991 scandal and for his works of fiction . The ad fails to paint a full picture for one thing Missouri has gained jobs . The amendment Talent opposed would not actually have repealed a single dollar of tax breaks It was an amendment offered to a budget resolution number 210 and simply set a goal for Congress to repeal the tax subsidy for certain domestic companies which move manufacturing operations and American jobs8221 .

---  There is evidence to suggest it may cause cancer at veryamp160high doses but not at the low doses typically found in foods . A FoodBabecom article says glyphosate has been found in prepared foods Vani Hari FoodBabe cites a couple of studies about the effects of the herbicide on animals . In March 2015 the World Health Organization deemed glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans . But in May 2016 a group of pesticide residue experts at WHO and the United Nations also concluded that glyphosate is 8220unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans8221 through their diets . The same chemical can have different effects at different doses which depends on how much of the chemical a person is exposed to . It can also depend on the route by which the exposure occurs eg ingestion inhalation or injection . Some experts say that at very high doses glyphosate can cause cancer . But at low doses it can also cause cancer but at low levels of the . herbicideamp160is unlikely to cause the disease . In fact a yettobepublished study that found no link between nonHodgkin lymphoma may have changed IARC’s findings .

In order to max out the acceptable daily intake of 05 mgkg of body weight per day a 175pound adult would have to eat more than 1270amp160servings of cereal a day and a child of half that weight would need to eat 635amp160 servings a day . Experts believe these doses of the herbicide don8217t pose a cancer risk to humans . Food and water are the main routes of exposure to glyphosate for the general population as in not pesticide applicators . But WHO says the major source of exposure is expected to be food because of the way the chemical interacts in solids and liquids . Glyphosate is considered the active chemical in many herbicides such as Monsanto8217s Roundup but it is not the only chemical that may make glyphosate more toxic than it is on its own Though research is sparse there are evidence to suggest these other chemicals may make the other chemicals make it more toxic to humans than glyphosate .

The 73yearold denied any misconduct 8220unreservedly but in a letter to WPP staff published late on Saturday he said the disruption was 8220putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business . A powerful spring storm pummeled the US Midwest and Plains on Saturday with blizzard conditions and high winds while tornadoes and thunderstorms threatened some of the South . Freezing rain and ice storms were expected to move into northern New England through Monday through Monday . The U.S. President Donald Trump called the operation a success of a multisided war that has killed at least half a million people . The bombing of two installations near Homs was the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syria and his superpower ally Russia but the three countries said the strikes were limited to Syria's chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling or toppling Assad . The United States France and Britain launched 105 missiles overnight in what the Pentagon said was a success operation of the attack in Syria . The air attack denounced by Damascus and its allies as an illegal act of aggression as an act of  US Vice President Mike Pence seemed less sure of the use of sarin saying that Washington may well determine that it was used along with chlorine along with sarin . Syria released video of the wreckage of a bombedout research lab but also of Assad arriving at work as usual with the caption 8220 morning of resilience . Late on Saturday Syria time a large explosion was heard in a Syrian governmentcontrolled area in a rural region south of Aleppo according to the Britainbased war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights . The Pentagon said there had been chemical weapons agents at one of the targets and that the strikes had significantly crippled Syria8217s ability to produce such weapons . Inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW were due to try to visit Douma on Saturday to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack on Saturday . The Western countries took precautions to avoid unexpected conflict with Russia but said allegations of chemical weapons use demand an investigation . The strike was more of a psychological nature rather than practical than practical rather than a military response rather than physical harm to Assad . Syria and its allies considered the attack a oneoff unlikely to do meaningful harm to the Assad regime . Russia condemned the Western states for refusing to wait for their findings and accused Britain of staging it to whip up antiRussian
---  Sara Khan published a confused book with the ambitious and progressivesounding title The Battle for British Islam Reclaiming Muslim Identity from Extremism . Despite the books glaring faults a few bits of useful information can still be salvaged from its troublesome pages . The book sneaks in glancing criticisms of the British government8217s 8220draconian methods of fighting Muslim extremism but on the whole the book is best seen as another tedious defence of the government . Khan acknowledges that 8220representations of Muslims in the British media are persistently negative unfair and discriminatory and have contributed to establishing a climate of fear or a 8216moral panic8217 with the Muslim 8216folk devil8217 at its heart . She then refers to a more recent Cardiff University study which 8220found that reporting on refugees was more 8216polarised and aggressive8217 in the UK than any other country in Europe . Khan then concludes that the myth persists that the ideology of Islamism that is what she decries as a sociopolitical that is the true expression of what it means to be a Muslim8221 p17 . Khan is thus correct in stating that 8216advocates an expansionist Islamic state governed by sharia law8217 is . The myth persists  Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood have been present in the UK since the 1960s but from the late 1980s faced a significant challenge for community support from militant Salafists who had returned to the UK after fighting in Afghanistan and regarded the Brotherhood as ineffective82178221 p53 A few pages later Khan explains how a group that was founded in 1984 by Abu Muntasir actually 8220spearheaded the spread of Salafism in Britain . But at no point does she make the obvious connection between the support given by the British and American governments to such militants and the growth of conservative Muslim ideologies in Britain. On the other hand this tragic connection is central to the political arguments that have been made by Seumas Milne Discussing terrorist attacks in his December 2013 article 8220 Woolwich attack . Khan spends a good proportion of her book attacking the legitimacy of the democratic concerns of trade unions in the main sector the National Union of Teachers and the University of . the National . Union of . University of Teachers . and the National College of Teachers are opposed to education and the PREVENTVENT strategy . But after citing such damming evidence Khan is having none of their substantial and reasonable and reasonable criticisms of the pre-ventive strategy
---  There is no 8220Dont ask dont tell8221 law which prohibits gay lesbian and bisexual individuals from serving openly in the US armed forces . President Obama thinks any change 8220should be done legislatively8221 since an executive order from him allowing homosexuals equal status in the military would be in defiance of the law as written by Congress . The Joint Chiefs of Staff have just published an essay in their quarterly journal comparing the end of the 8220 repeal of the policy to the civil rights struggle to racially integrate the armed forces. The Joint chiefs of Staff compare the end to the racial integration of the military to that of the Civil Rights struggle to integrate the military. The left has nothing better to offer than riding roughshod over the opinions of the majority of servicemen. It is doubtful to say the least whether 8220debate8221 is the right word is the word for change 8212 and repealing the law. The latest Military Times poll found that 10 percent of respondents would leave the service if gays were allowed openly to serve and another 14 percent would consider leaving the military service as a human right. The fact that open homosexuals are also excluded cannot by itself be considered an injustice. The new moralism owes something to President Obamas style of oratory which has  Military honor is inextricably bound up with ideas of masculinity and sexuality . For most heterosexual males shame attends a reputation as much for homosexuality as for weakness or cowardice . The advocates of allowing open homosexuals to serve often cite the example of Israel or Britain both of which have integrated homosexuals into their military services apparently without incident . But they have done so in circumstances which do not allow for objective assessment of the success or failure of the experiment . In Israel all citizens must perform military service which affords much more scope for diluting the impact if any of the presence of homosexuals than would be the case in an allvolunteer army like that in the U.S. In Britain the change came about in response to an order from the European Court of Human Rights whose decrees have the force of law . It echoes the words of Henry V. Shakespeares before the Battle of Agincourt. We are happy with me that is so familiar as to be almost familiar with the experience of Henry Shakespeare. It is a way of looking at the experience that is that is a familiar clich. but a few few we are happy that we have been happy with Henry Shares. It echoes a few we were happy that Henry Shakespeare.
---  Earlier this month someone involved in the government8217s latest report on climate change provided The New York Times with a copy of the version submitted to the Trump administration for final approval . The main intent of the leak according to several people tracking the report was to complicate any attempt to suppress the study or water down its findings . Report was submitted in late June and Trump administration has broad authority to review its findings Any one of a number of government agencies can block its release which is ultimately subject to presidential review . Some of the scientists involved in preparing the document expressed concern that it might never see the light of day . The Fourth National National Climate Assessment scheduled for publication in late 2018 is expected to be released in the spring of 2018 . The 1990 law has required such assessments every four years by an office 8212 the US Global Change Research Program was created in 1989 by Republican President George HW Bush to coordinate research on climate climate change and other global environmental issues across more than a dozen government agencies . There have been tussles over these assessments from the start of the Clinton administration to the start to the end of the Obama administration and the Bush administration . It is notable that the next full assessment will not appear before a Democrat wins the presidency before the next Democratic presidential election .  Pruitt criticized efforts to publicize the draft findings and described next steps . In an interview last week with a morning talk show on WBAP radio in DallasFort Worth Pruitt appeared to offer conflicting signals on the climate issue . There still is still a chance the report could survive relatively unscathed according to interviews with people involved with the process or tracking it closely tracking it . There are still a range of questions surrounding the findings that surround the longstanding and bipartisan Washington tradition of highlighting the findings for some reasons . The report reaches conclusions at odds with the views of Scott Pruitt, Scott Pruitt and others in the administration . It also contains long sections on the scientifically established and established uncertainties . Here there is plenty of room for everyone for some of the findings to highlight that there are plenty of challenges for everyone to find that some of their findings that are critical and that there is no clear conclusions that are consistent with the findings and that the findings are not clear and that some are unlikely to be fully resolved . But there still is a chance to survive unscathed with some of those findings for everyone in the Administration’s suit for some . There is also a chance for the report to survive according to people involved in the Washington tradition . There also a number of people involved .
---  WAMM is the first medical marijuana club in the country to be granted nonprofit status . The collective which grows its own marijuana and distributes it free to its members each week is no pot party . About 85 percent of its members are terminally ill . Many of those who line up at the club every Tuesday evening had not used the drug before they developed lifethreatening illnesses like cancer and AIDS . Federal law supersedes state law and the government refuses to budge in classifying marijuana as a dangerous illegal narcotic 8212 and a gateway to harder drugs 8212 with no medical value . But that failed to alter the federal government8217s position that possessing marijuana should be a crime . In September a Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco ruled that the government could not punish the doctors who recommend the benefits of medical marijuana to their patients to punish their patients . But the fight for the right to exist from the passage of the right is still over far from the right from the fight to exist since the right of the public8217's growing acceptance of the medicinal drug that seems increasingly unlikely given the public 8217s growing acceptance as medicinal marijuana that seems unlikely given it seems to be increasingly unlikely . The fight for legitimacy is increasingly unlikely to given  Valerie Corral is an epileptic epileptic who uses marijuana to control seizures and alleviate mindstopping headaches . WAMM is strict about membership admitting only the very sick and only those with a written recommendation from a doctor who agrees to monitor the use of marijuana in the patient8217s treatment . Valerie and Mike Corral are expert growers having started more than 25 years ago following a freak car accident that left Valerie wracked by seizures . The Corrals own their own home and a second piece of property in the Santa Cruz mountains with part of the insurance settlement she eventually received from her accident and began growing marijuana in an organic garden . Eventually they began giving some of it away to people they knew who were dying of cancer patients who wanted to use marijuana for their illnesses . They decided to seek the maximum three years in prison for the crime yard in 1992 but decided that no jury would convict them . The highly-time local district attorney that decided they decided they were arrested again and decided to decide not to convict them again after a flood of calls from people wanting to use it over the years . Many more than the more than 80 years of the years they decided to give the more of the marijuana they decided that they wanted to die over the more .
---  FactCheckorg found several examples of tweets in the past several days from both parties that misinform their followers from reinforcing misperceptions about their opponents to making flat out false claims . Spreading disinformation via Twitter is thoroughly bipartisan here is just a sample of the mistwittering emanating from designated party twitterers on both sides . In one tweet the National Republican Congressional Committee blamed a plant closing in California on the new health care law . The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee accused a Republican House candidate of promising to privatize Social Security in order to secure an endorsement . The DCCCamp160makes another guiltbyassociation argument to link Burns to privatization It says Burns has the backing of politicians including former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich who supported private Social Security accounts . There is no evidence that the two are related to the closing of a Hormel Foods plant in Iowa according to a story in the PostBulletin in a new plant in Turlock Calif . The story and the Minnesotabased company though do not say that the plant closing had anything to do with the health care legislation for the closing . In a statement on the company’s website Mike Devine the vice president of grocery products operations says only that the closing will  The Democratic National Committee contrasts the president8217s speech about the financial regulation bill with a fundraising event held by a Republican senator Florida Sen George LeMieux on the same day . Democrats have raised far more money from securities and investment firms than Republicans in the 20092010 election cycle . The event had multiple hosts with little or no connection to Wall Street according to the invitation obtained by the Sunlight Foundation and posted on one of its websites politicalpartytimeorg Four political action committees and four individuals hosted the event which was held at the National Republican Senatorial Committee's offices . Of the four individuals who cohosted the event three are lobbyists but none could be considered a 8220Wall Street lobbyist . The DNCamp160is so sure of itself it is now running a TVamp160ad called Risky Business that makes reference to this fundraiser with Wall Street lobbyists . We have debunked the unproven exaggerations by saying GOPamp160senators collected the contributions of banking lobbyists representing the very companies Republicans have been shielding from reform . The Obama tax increase is actually the expiration of the Bush tax cuts as was scheduled when those tax measures were passed with Republican majorities . We leave readers to decide whether allowing the tax cuts expire is a tax increase to expire as current law dictates .

---  Globalization has led to outsourcing of factory jobs in apparel sneakers electronics and other industries to lowwage countries in the Global South . Globalization is a doubleedged process as far as women are concerned . The use of cheap female labor for export industries is not new 8212 it was pioneered in South Korea during its socalled economic miracle as women were drawn from farm to factory work . Some feminist scholars have condemned the extreme exploitation of female workers in export enclaves . But others defend EPZs as a path to escape familial patriarchy or as a way for women to earn incomes that exceed what they could get in domestic industries . The extreme end of this spectrum of opinion is perhaps the view of Shelley Feldman who has studied export processing factories in Bangladesh . Shelley Feldman is skeptical of the simpleminded and skeptical of some of the critical of feminist scholars who fail to acknowledge the complex and contradictory accounts of women’s lives were motivated on a simplified dichotomy. Shelley Feldman. She argues that the Bangladeshi women were motivated to rely on a simplistic dichotomy were motivated by the simplicity of the 8220 economic dichotomy . Shelley Feasher says that women are not motivated by a simplified account of the simplistic view of the complex economic accounts. She writes that the  The cooption of feminist ideals on the global stage goes beyond the use of a woman8217s right to paid employment to justify exploitative working conditions . Women in EPZs work in countries like Haiti, Haiti, Mexico and Bangladesh have experienced brutal conditions under which most women in the factories work . Women are subjected to health tests including pregnancy testing which can involve being examined naked and being asked personal questions such as 82208216Do you have a boyfriend82178216 and 8216How often do you have sex8217 and 82178221 Jeremy Seabrook who has also observed factories in Bangladesh agrees with Kabeer that the women workers of Dhaka Bangladesh go through epic struggles to get factory jobs having to overcome the obstacles placed in their path by patriarchal families and communities . But he argues that they have no power to decide which industries settle in Bangladesh to take advantage of them They work fourteenhour days with wages often delayed and endure brutal overseers and endure horrific working conditions. He witnessed a fire in Dhaka on August 27 2000 that killed a dozen people and in recent years more than two hundred factory workers have died in fires .

---  The Washington Blade caught up with Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin on Capitol Hill Tuesday to discuss the loss on the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance . Griffin said internal research is ongoing on what lessons are immediately clear such as the potential effects of transphobic ads . He said LGBT advocates should take station managers to task for airing TV ads seen as demonizing the transgender community . Griffin also said there has to be a more aggressive and a more effective response to the outrageous lies that our opponents in that campaign pushed forward particularly in those two weeks8221 Griffin said he is very proud of the support we were able to give that campaign both in terms of resources in kind of resources and significant staff . The Houston ordinance went down at the ballot in a devastating loss for LGBT advocates by a 6139 margin . The opposition has created a campaignabox and I think they8217re going to shop those lies to other places all around the country to other people around the U.S. and our side has to do a much better job of aggressively knocking down places all the hateful rhetoric to knock down places down places and when they come down places, he said . The second thing is pushing back against anti-antitrans attacks and pushing back on anti-transphobic attacks  Many station managers in a lot of markets around the country would have never accepted those ads . I think there are ways to better affirmatively state what we all might see as the obvious It is today illegal to enter any restroom and commit a crime And I think that this is language that needs to be better elevated because folks in Houston were left thinking truthfully thinking that this law was therefore going to make that legal It might seem obvious to most all of us that that that is obviously illegal .

---  Carlos BringasRodriguez was deported Dec 22 at 3 am and literally dumped at the border with a limited supply of his HIV medications . The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in March determined the persecution he faced in Mexico because of his sexual orientation made him eligible for asylum in the U.S. The US government only agreed to allow him to return to the United States after a subsequent order from the Ninth Circuit on Thursday instructing DHS 8220to return petitioner to the US through the Port of Entry at San Ysidro California no later than January 16 2018 . Attorney for the gay asylum seeker said he was relieved the nightmare of being separated from his family over the holidays would end soon . The treatment was "not just cruel but inhumane and outrageous" and "outrageous and outrageous," said attorney Munmeeth Soni of the attorney for the Los Angelesbased Immigrant Defenders Law Center who confirmed he was paroled Tuesday and said his treatment was unacceptable and said he is still traumatized and shaken up from being deported and separated from my husband and cannot wait to be reunited with his wife . The case was denied by the Trump administration and said it was a nightmare of separation from his wife and their 12-year-old cousin as a daughter  BringasRodriguez checked in with ICE in June and was told the next time he8217d need to do so was Dec 20 . But in the meantime unbeknownst to him his case was scheduled for a new hearing on Aug 20 in immigration court in San Diego . DHS showed up for the hearing but he didn't show up and the immigration court issued a deportation order against him . His failure to appear demonstrates he abandoned his asylum application . He was immediately detained and taken by plane to Mexico where he is now holed up in a hotel and running out of his HIV medications . He has no way to get these medications when they run out in the next 9 days in 9 days . He is currently terrified and quickly running out his medications he has run out of these medications .

The petition was not allowed to make medical arrangements for his family and no one was allowed to respond to his response for his case . The case was re-opened after the Ninth Circuit had been ruled over because the court had ruled as a result of a writ of mandamus on the basis of the lower circuit .
---  A number of questions about the Passover experience some large and some small have bothered me in recent years 8211 and I wonder if any have bothered you as well . Several concern the way things are done on Passover in a more general way and several focus on a more particular issue 8211 namely the way the Sages structured the core of the Haggadah 8211 the Maggid the actual telling of the story . The core obligation of the Seder night is Sippur Yetziat Mitzrayim retelling the story of the Exodus from Egypt . We need to start thinking about the obligation the Torah places upon us to retell the Exodus on a yearly basis Why do we even do this Why Why Do We Retell the Exodus? The answer to this question I believe may lie tucked away in the answer may lie hidden away in The Core of Maggadah The Seder Night, says Rabbi Zivivah. The answer is not to blame God but to thank the Almighty for redeeming us from slavery. We are having ecstatic songs that contain our miraculous deliverance songs and Hallel the songs that contains our ecstatic songs. It may be that the focus of our story is not so much education but thanksgiving  Parashat Bikkurim is the text that provides the framework for Maggid as we mentioned above . Leaving aside the text8217s significance in the Haggadah if you simply read the text as a text you will notice a number of oddities about it . Below you8217ll find the text from Deuteronomy 26 What strikes you as strange about it? A Phantom Declaration is worded in the past tense and the farmer is saying that 8220he has declared before God that he has come to the land82308221 But how could that be He hasn't said anything at all yet? We are declaring what he was declaring But strangely he didn't say anything He is referring to a phantom declaration 8211 something he has said without even saying anything . We call Maggido 8220Maggid8221 because we are doing what that farmer was doing We are saying what he didn’t say anything . The farmer is talking about Egyptian servitude and redeeming us from slavery Why do it as we make him in the middle of the middle? We need to stop talking as we do it? We have to make him say whatever it is whatever it needs to be done as we stop talking where we do
---  False claims spread by multiple websites are not supported by solid scientific evidence . There is no solid evidence that eating tilapia increases the risk of cancer and Alzheimer8217s disease . The fish is also a lowfat source of protein and a number of vitamins and minerals including Vitamin B12 and selenium . Other fish such as salmon are a better source of omega3 fatty acids which are essential nutrients . The inflammatory potential of hamburger and pork bacon is lower than the average serving of farmed Tilapia . Bacon is also high in added sodium and high in sodium . The researchers measured omega6 fatty acids in 30 fish that were found to have fewer omega3s than those in 30-standard fish . If your doctor or cardiologist is telling you to eat more fish then you should look for varieties that have higher levels of omega 3 and avoid those with high inflammatory potential821 omega3 and avoid fish with high omega3 . If you want to eat fish with more fish you need to look for more fish that have low ratios of omega6 omega3 to omega3, omega3 or omega3. The researchers found that Atlantic salmon contained high concentrations of Omega3s and Atlantic salmon and Atlantic Salmon contained high ratios of these omega6.  William S Harris an expert in fatty acids and human nutrition at the University of South Dakota told us tilapia isn't high in omega3 or omega6 fatty acids because the fish isn8217t high in fat . The levels of fatty acids in fish correspond to the quantity of the fat in fish . Harris wrote a commentary on the Chilton8217s study when it was published . He pointed out that there is no strong evidence linking arachidonic acid to the onset of Alzheimer8217 in humans . But it doesn't mean eating foods containing omega fatty acid increases the risk of Alzheimer and other diseases . The study in question didn’t say that bacon was generally healthier than Tilapia but bacon and hamburgers have high levels of saturated fat and added sodium both of which are linked to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes and cancer says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The NIH says that high dietary omega fatty acids are not a good source of protein and other nutrients but they are good sources of protein, other nutrients such as bacon and burgers are high fat and sodium content . The University of Arizona expert in aquaculture at Arizona agreed with Harris that the study didn't say bacon was a healthier than tilap
---  A wellpaid expert for the defense tried and failed to pull off a courtroom demonstration with former APD officer Levi Chavez8217s department issued Glock 9 mm pistol that would cast serious doubt on a key prosecution theory . Larry McCann who testified as an expert in crime scene analysis and other matters tried four times to show the jury that he could in one continuous motion pull the trigger then press the button that releases the magazine . The video was not shown to the jury which by late next week is expected to begin deliberating to determine whether Chavez killed his 26-yearold wife Tera Chavez in 2007 and tried to make it look like a suicide . The defense contends that Tera shot herself and Chavez has pleaded innocent . The jury will begin deliberations next week to decide if Chavez killed her in 2007 but the defense contends she shot herself . The prosecution contends that the magazine had to be 8220seated8221 for the gun to chamber another round and that the gun was not locked in place in the butt of the pistol . A bullet was in the chamber when he found the gun next to Tera's body but the magazine was not in place but the gun had not been locked in . The trial has a different theory that she died instantly so she would not  Levi Chavez8217s murder trial shifted to the defense as control of former Albuquerque police officer's murder trial shifts to defense . Levi Chavez is accused of killing his wife Tera Chavez in October 2007 and killing October 2, 2007 . Rita Romero Levi Chavez's mother testified that she never knew about her son shortly before her 16th birthday shortly before she became pregnant with the couple's first child shortly before the birth of their first child . Rita Chavez said Tera and Levi Chavez were having problems early in the 10-year relationship around the time Tera became pregnant . The trial will resume around 130 pm in a different courtroom on Tuesday July 2, 2013 . The judge ruled that the ethics charge couldn8217t be mentioned to the jury although McCann's resignation from the Virginia Forensic Science Academy could be discussed . The 35000 the city paid McCann was paid by the city of Albuquerque was offlimits . The jury was asked to go over crime scene photos with McCann but the jury was on the fritz. The trial is set to resume around 1230 pm on Thursday . The prosecution had an early lunch break and the trial is expected to resume at around 130pm on July 3, 2013. The jury8217 will return to the trial again on Monday .

Bolton's pronouncements on both issues are at odds with assessments of US intelligence assessments . Bolton is known as a dedicated hawk who marries bureaucratic savvy with belligerent rhetoric . Bolton exaggerated what the US government knew about weapons programs in Iraq Cuba and Syria and retaliated against analysts who differed with him according to intelligence officials involved in the events . Bolton has characterized North Korea8217s nuclear and ballistic missile programs as a threat best eliminated by a preemptive military strike US intelligence analysts have warned that such a strike would trigger a North Korean counterattack that would kill tens of thousands of South Koreans American troops and civilians and others as far away as Japan .

With his help the process reached undreamt heights . I warned against this catastrophic process in vain . I forecast that once the Algerian war was over France would drop Israel like a hot coal and renew its ties with the Arab world . Israel adopted the US instead instead of adopting the US .

---  President Donald Trump and his national security aides on Thursday discussed US options on Syria where he has threatened missile strikes in response to a suspected poison gas attack . A Russian envoy voiced fears of wider conflict between Washington and Moscow . There were signs of a global effort to head off a direct confrontation between Russia and the West . Russia is estimated to have dozens of aircraft at its Hmeim air base in Syria including bombers and fighters as well as 10 to 15 vessels in the Mediterranean . Russia said it deployed military police in Douma on Thursday after the town was taken over by government forces . France's President Emmanuel Macron said France had proof the Syrian government carried out the attack near Damascus which aid groups have said killed dozens of people . US officials familiar with an investigation of samples from Douma and the symptoms of victims said initial indications that a mix of weaponized chlorine gas and sarin were used in the attack appeared to be correct . But US intelligence agencies have not completed their assessment or reached a final conclusion the officials said Russia has not yet reached a decision to strike back when all the necessary information has been gathered . Russia and Iran have said reports of the attack were fabricated by rebels and rescue workers and have accused the United States of seeking to use it as a pretext to attack  Oklahoma8217s largest teachers union on Thursday called off a nearly twoweek walkout that shut public schools statewide saying it had secured historic gains in education funding after school budgets were devastated by a decade of cuts . Move came after the Republicandominated legislature passed its first major tax hikes in a quarter century that raised about 450 million in revenue for education . Oklahoma teachers who were seeking a 10000 annual wage hike over three years will see an average annual pay raise of about 6100 from the increased funding lawmakers said . Oklahoma walkout began on April 2 and affected about 500,000 of the state's 700,000 public school students . Some major districts have said they will resume classes on Monday . The strike was part of a wave of actions by teachers in states that have some of the lowest perstudent spending in the country . A West Virginia strike ended last month with a pay raise for teachers and educators in Arizona protested before classes on Wednesday without skipping work to seek enhanced education funding . The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters Comeys publicist also did not respond to a request for comment for comment . The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment to comment on the strike or a comment from the White House or the Washington Post .
---  Nils Kauffman who served as an education officer for the US Agency for International Development in Afghanistan said he noticed irregularities at a vocational training institute the agency was funding during his visits to its campus in downtown Kabul in 2012 and 2013 . USAID continued giving the institute funds totaling at least 123 million through last Sunday according to USAID spokesman Sam Ostrander . Afghanistan's newlyappointed education minister raised questions about the veracity of the US claim when he told his country8217s parliament that some aid funds had flowed to socalled 8220ghost schools which are only on paper8221 . The top federal auditor for US reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan John F Sopko expressed concern that 8220US and other donors may have paid for schools that students do not attend and for the salaries of teachers who do not teach8221 according to several Afghan media accounts of the May 27 session . The new minister said that officials in the previous government 8211 in power from 2004 to 2014 lied about the number of schools to obtain more foreign funds . The matter is still under investigation in Afghanistan . The agency will provide a detailed reply to Sopko by the June 30 deadline by the . June 18 letter to acting USAID administrator Alfonso E Lenhardt released by Sopko  USAID administrator of USAID from 2010 until February singled the vocational institute out for special praise in a July 2013 speech at the US Institute of Peace in Washington . Shah said he had the chance to meet some of these young women on visits to places like the Afghan Vocational Training Institute . But Kauffman the former USAID education officer was not the only one voicing concerns about the institute8217s achievements . The institute began receiving USAID funds in 2007 according to Roshan and Ostrander . The funds were initially for scholarships and were paid under USAID8217's Afghanistan capacitybuilding program . But the financing was switched to the agency's education department in 2010 under a subcontract with Education Development Center Inc a Massachusettsbased nonprofit organization . Students were supposed to be trained in business management construction horticulture information and communication technology and automotive repair . The Institute paid its employees8217 salaries in cash rather than traceable bank transfers was still a problem the inspectors wrote . The audit by accounting firm Grant Thornton 8217s Afghanistan office USAID staff twice came to inspect the institute twice in July and August 2011 but Kauffmen said the institute obstructed efforts by USAID teams to dig deeper into its records a claim supported by an internal report about its site visits .
---  Jane Harman is the second richest member of the House of Representatives with estimated assets between 112 and 377 million dollars . The Southern California Democrat is facing a serious challenge from Los Angeles school teacher Marcy Winograd in the 36th Congressional District along the Southern California coastline . In April 2009 Harman reportedly agreed to intervene with the Justice Dept on behalf of two top AIPAC officials Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman who were then under indictment for passing classified information to Israel in an FBIinitiated 8220sting8221 Whether or not that phone call will come back to haunt her will be a factor in her heated race against WinogRad . The candidates8217 widely separated positions on the IsraelPalestine conflict dominating the political landscape dominating the Democratic political landscape . The last word on the incident has not been returned to the House Ethics Committee but a year later has been nothing reported and calls have been made to the congressman who got the job as House Select Intelligence Chair Silvestre Reyes from Texas told Texas told the Washington Post that there is apparently an investigation into the incident have not been reported . Harman was among 30 House members and several aides who were investigated by the House ethics Committee on issues that included defense lobbying and corporate peddling influence .  Marcy Winograd is running against Jane Harman in her primary reelection to Congress in the 36th District of Los Angeles . Harman's campaign put out a call for help to the poster boy of Southern California liberals Henry Waxman D30 Waxmanamp160 has a history of moonlighting as an Israel Lobby enforcer and he took after WinogRad with a vengeance . Waxman is far far outside the bipartisan mainstream of views that has long insisted that US policy be based upon rocksolid support for our only democratic ally in the Middle East . Winogsrad is far more concerned with the welfare of Israel than what happens in their district not to mention the United States . It is unlikely that either Harman or Winog Rads stand on Israel will be determining the factor in determining the election in the Congressional Congressional election in Los Angeles' Congressional election 8220th District . The majority of the affluent Jewish population in the District will be deciding the outcome of the election . The vast investment portfolio held by Harman and her businessman husband Sidney founder of audioinfotainment equipment manufacturer Harman International Industries Harman has a marked preference shown for investment houses banks and real estate interests across the globe . The couple have invested between 12 and 47 million and Goldman Sachs
---  Today I went to the tunnels in Rafah I climbed into a loop of rope attached to a wire on a pulley and was lowered 7 meters to the tunnel floor . My guide beckoned again and again I followed promising myself I would turn back at the next light . But when we got there I saw more lights ahead and I thought maybe he was taking me to a room or another chimney out of the tunnel and I followed further We continued this way for I don8217t know how many meters and soon I couldn't hear anyone behind me only a murmur that might have been distant voices ahead . After the massacre the tunnels brought lions and tigers to replace the ones loosed by the attack on Gaza8217s largest zoo . Can you imagine Amid all the bombing and chaos wild animals running through the streets of Gaza? Many people have told me the next big project is to smuggle in cars a necessity in a necessity . The tunnels provide a necessary lifeline for the people who are born out of their place but as end of the attack patiently awaited the attack but as my guide realized the end of my panic but as soon as my panic ended my panic began my panic I realized that they are born of panic but my panic was my panic .  Dr Sarraj finds the origin of this trend in the Nakba catastrophe of 1948 when Israelis ethnically cleansing Palestinians from their land Since 1948 the trauma of losing agency over one8217s life and living conditions has become part of the Palestinian psyche8221 This trauma has grown with every violent incursion into Palestinian communities strongly intensified with the first Intifada in 1987 when Israeli soldiers mercilessly beat children armed only with rocks and also beat and arrested their parents . More than 45 of Palestinian children have watched Israeli soldiers beat andor arrest their fathers and the trend Dr Sarrraj describes has grown exponentially since the DecemberJanuary massacre . Sarrj tells another story from a brief detention in a Palestinian prison he heard a Palestinian guard interrogating a prisoner in a cell next to his . In this moment of uncontrollable anger the guard had been severely tortured in an Israeli prison the guard became his tormentor . In the moment he began screaming at the prisoner in Hebrew, the guard was severely tortured the prisoner . In that moment he became the prisoner became the prison guard became the Palestinian guard became a Palestinian prisoner in an uncontrollable . The phenomenon Dr Sarrraj later learned that he later learned to learn that he learned that the guard in an . Israeli prison
---  North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test on Sunday September 3 2017 stating it was the first test of a thermonuclear weapon or a hydrogen bomb . Robert Kelley is a licensed nuclear engineer who has worked on many aspects of nuclear weapons and later on nuclear nonproliferation . The Real News Network Im Sharmini Peries coming to you from Baltimore . On to talk about this with me is Robert Kelley Hes a veteran of 35 years who worked at the US Department of Energy Nuclear Weapons Complex most recently at Los Alamos and managed the centrifuge and plutonium programs at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . He served twice as director of the nuclear inspections in Iraq in 1992 and again in 2001 . He is also affiliated with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden and several other nonpro-pro-liferation organizations . Is there evidence that what the North Koreans detonated on September 3 was a . what is known as a . hydrogen bomb that could be detonated even at high altitudes for super powerful EMP attack on the planet and a . nuclear attack? We need some radioactive debris that will leak out of the test site that will lead to a global catastrophe and a huge number of human casualties. We have a few pieces of information about whether or not it was a hydrogen .  The explosion takes place underground in a tunnel where they can walk in carry in hundreds of pounds of equipment and materials to make the nuclear explosion underground . This is not a realistic military situation This is a chance for an experiment and also to really try to fool us politically . The North Koreans have pretty well pulled wool over the eyes of the American media. Theyll be very happy to see all the people running around in the mainstream media saying this was a hydrogen bomb . The United States have a pretty good idea where these missiles are going They can track them around the region and have a lot more about the North Korean than the North Koreans do once they fire them . The U.S. knows a lot of more about where they fire it in some direction than the N Koreans do . The US has no longer have a way of seeing where its no longer having a direction of some direction of which they're no longer seeing where they�re seeing where it’re going to fire it . The last time they fired this thing was when it disappeared over Japan a few weeks ago the last time it disappeared and then broke up and fell in the ocean . They don’t really know how close it came to the intended target . They dont just break up in flight and
---  Elizabeth Drew 8220Trump The Presidency in Peril8221 The New York Review of Books June 22 2017 . The critical question is When or will Trump8217s voters realize that he isn8217t delivering on his promises that his health care and tax proposals will help the wealthy at their expense . The question then is how is how to subdue or reenchant some 40 of the population who got out and voted for Trump in 2016 call these the Forgotten as well as keep the Lost including some or all of the 135 in poverty in their same benumbed state of day to day survival . Some Americans will not hold Trump responsible for the failure of his promise but rather all the antiTrumpians who blocked his path, says Drew . The warring divide of perceptual frames cannot be expected to dissolve even if Trump is impeached indicted resigns selfdestructs or angry Liberals frogwalk him out of the Oval Office . There will never again be a simple TV image of a guilty Nixon for all to see. We are instead in a sandstorm of blinding spins narratives tweets and emoji that bring no universally accepted clarity to focus . The Lost and the Forgotten remain lost and forgotten or become forces not easily conned again. The loss and forgotten will remain  The Forgotten are aware of losing a selfimage that they connect with the Golden Age of Middle Class WellBeing The Forgotten recall being at the head of the table and now see that place taken from them By whom What Donald Trump has done is point out the usurpers and promised to 8220deconstruct8221 them I do not believe the Forgotten are blaming their own bad choices for their fallen state They are rightly looking for external factors but these are in a maze of economic and ideological entanglements that our political campaigns are not designed to handle . The easiest beginning to bring the Lost out of survival mode is a nationalized basic income Finland style The Lost and the Forgotten would be aided by President Trump also advocating taxing the wealthy or a Robin Hood tax on all Wall Street transactions . The Lost may suffer attrition due to unattended health problems incarceration and addiction addiction and heroin addiction opiod heroin and opiod . The Forgotten will need to be tagged and remove their own protection as they can be tagged with their own own lethal lethal lethal . The DSM 6 will describe the number of casualties of the Lost and The Forgotten as well as the Forgotten as a rising psychopathologies that will be tagged in a rising number of social psychopathologies . We can expect an even greater increase in psychopathologies
---  President Bush8217s recent failed trip to Latin America the diplomatic toll mounts . Not a single significant achievement was wracked up by the Bush trip . Of the five countries visited only stopovers in Uruguay and Brazil could be even remotely defended as bringing some good news . While Guatemala and Colombia turned out to be total disasters with Mexico generating a yawn . Colombia was no better Bush's arrival in Bogot225 couldn8217t have happened at a worse time as every moment ticked off another scandal some of them leading in the direction of President Uribe's office . Bush's visit to Guatemala was less of a showpiece affair and much more a public relations catastrophe causing great embarrassment to the White House planners and the Bureau of InterAmerican Affairs which bore of the responsibility of planning the fiasco . In Brazil the ethanolsoaked theme produced more bark than bite with few concrete results coming from the deliberations coming from a little concrete results . The assassination of three Salvadoran as well as their own officials were plotting the elimination of their opponents were plotting their bloody opponents at the next moment . This established the fact that drug cartels had finally managed to infiltrate the highest institutional levels of Mexican drug cartels . The high status occupied by some Mexican drug lords could be wearing tuxedos at one moment  Guatemalan and Salvadoran police officers were murdered in Guatemala and El Salvador . Guatemalan police officers had been remanded upon the instruction of some unknown higher authority . They were then moved to a maximum security facility closer to Guatemala City where they later were murdered . The bare facts surrounding this shocking incident provide startling evidence of the meager lawandorder system that is found in much of Central America as well as the largely fictional nature of the already universally condemned legal processes available in President Oscar Berger8217s Guatemala . Guatemala is a spectacular example of the Aristotelian concept of the corruption of pure governance where the law givers are converted into their prime violators . Guatemala and Honduras are in a state of incipient anarchy 8216controlled8217 by security forces that are in many ways indistinguishable from paramilitary units that cooperate with the police and armed forces in order to suborn the legal process . Many Central American officials have been seriously corrupted by the drug trade and at least some of the deceased parties involved in the incident were likely to have been murdered because they worked for rival cartels . The suspected murderers of the police detainees were also assumed to be cartel8211 associated with the murder of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan officers . The incident raises troubling questions about the moral standing of Guatemala

Every Black demographic no matter how it is overwhelmingly pro-Obama for president How could it not be so with the Black Obama vote in the Black Barack Obama primaries? How is it not a Black Obama voting for president how it not with the black Obama primaries. How does it not have a black Obama voting 95 percent for president? How do it not matter how you vote for president. How it is the uncontresistible pull of race and the uncontirresistible pulling of race of the uncontainable pull of . race and solidarity of race. How you can it not  The generational transition that is reordering black politics didn8217t start this year It has been happening gradually and quietly for at least a decade as younger AfricanAmericans Barack Obama among them have challenged their elders in traditionally black districts . Corporate America made a strategic decision to become active players in Black Democratic politics 8211 an arena they had largely avoided in postSixties decades . In 2002 the corporate Right fielded and heavily funded three Black Democratic candidates for high profile offices in majority Black contests . Two of them Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Alabama Congressman Artur Davis are featured in Matt Bai8217s Times article . The corporate media declared with certainty but with no facts to buttress the claim that the African American middle class class was becoming more . a younger generation was becoming . becoming more than a younger . generation .

Joaquin 8220El Chapo8221 Guzman broke out of the maximum security Puente Grande Jalisco federal prison in January 2001 just days after the inauguration of thenpresident Vicente Fox . Since Good Friday March 21st when 22 citizens were slaughtered in gun battles from Quintana Roo to Chihuahua the daily body count has left Baghdad in the dust .

Arturo Beltran Leyva is considered facilitator in Chapito II8217's wild demise  Edgar Millan was blown away in the living room of his apartment in the drugsaturated centercity Colonia Guerrero where he was considered a neighborhood hero . The killing was carried out on the same day as nine presumed Beltran Leyva associates engaged police in a lethal shootout in neighboring Morelos state . Millan made it a point to sleep in different domiciles each night and it appears that the killer a petty thief high on Ice speed who carried two brandnew machine pistols and a duplicate set of keys to the apartment was tipped off as to the top cop's imminent arrival by someone very very close to Millan inside the Public Security Secretariat . This latest act in Mexico8217s Narco Opera had resonance in Washington too where White House security spokesperson Gordon Johndroe spotlighted the Millan killing to urge the US Congress to pass the Bush administration8218s socalled Merida Initiative AKA Plan Mexico a 14 billion USD drug war boondoggle . The toll at the western end of the US border in Tijuana January to April is 190 homicides the high water mark being 19 on April 26th .

Several of the justices on a court that has a 54 conservative majority expressed concerns that the law was fashioned in order to specifically target the centers which are staunchly opposed to abortion . Even some of the liberal justices voiced concern over parts of the law during an hourlong argument in an appeal by a group of nonprofit facilities called crisis pregnancy centers of a lower court ruling upholding the Democraticbacked 2015 law . The case represents a crossroads of two contentious issues abortion and the breadth of the right to freedom of speech under the US Constitution8217s First Amendment .

Many G20 officials fought hard at the meeting to preserve language from Hamburg Summit which was signed by Trump in July 2017 . G20 ministers repeated traditional pledges to refrain from competitive devaluations and avoid targeting their foreign exchange rates for export advantage . But they also added some new language on exchange rates emphasizing stability and flexibility . The new G20 language on the need for trade dialogue comes as Trump is readying plans to punish China with tariffs over its intellectual property practices . Two officials briefed on the matter said Trump is expected to unveil tariffs on up to 60 billion in Chinese technology and telecoms products by Friday the same day when a tariff of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum are to apply . The G20 also called for continued international monitoring of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and their risks such as Bitcoin and its risks It said these assets raised issues with consumer and investor protections and market integrity money laundering and terrorist financing . In recent days congressional leaders and White House have engaged in negotiations which appear to have failed that could have given Trump the full 25 billion to begin construction on a wall along the US border wall .

---  To understand the way Donald Trump has restructured the game board of politics is now the only way to understand what the results of this presidential election may be Trump has done a better job of understanding a part of the US population who are not compatible with ideologies of either Democrat or Republican . How this population came into being has much to do with the historically political indifference and disinterest in politics that claims most Americans or more precisely only a Pavlov type response to 8220Big Government . Economics fares worse here because while politics has a personalized dimension such as 8220I hate that bitch Pelosi or that bitch Hillary or that swine Kissinger or that crook Nixon8221 and so on economics provides no such foothold .

Bernie has done enough to give solidarity enough to come close to winning the Democratic Primary in support of solidarity with solidarity with the Bernie Sanders campaign . Trump8217s stay among the Trump supporters in spite of the Trump demographic cannot fathom what  Donald Trump8217s victory in the Republican primary means that his followers remain in play . They do not have a Leftistsocialist agenda but an inchoate anger and readiness to break things up . They are breaking bad and no one but Trump seems to be holding the leash because he is one of those individuals birthed in his own mind as invincible he too remains leashless . Trump is the hammer for all those who have been hammered.

It has crippled the Superfund program which is charged with cleaning up millions of pounds of toxic industrial wastes such as arsenic lead mercury and vinyl chloride in more than 1000 neighborhoods in 48 states .

Keith: The industry wants to put before us pick your poison pipelines or rail. They both have problems I mean weve seen massive spills like the one Enbridge actually had in Michigan with the spelling bitumen which actually sinks in water so therefore its much more hazardous . Steve HORN: We think you should ban the use of the DOT111 cars right now because they simply arent safe enough and the government should be looking at how we can sort of make that transition to green energy rather than you know ask us to choose between the risks are worse between the two pipelines.

The form of the alleged conspiracy was a 8216troll farm8217 an office populated by various functionaries who worked together from 2014 to today to magnify already existing social tensions on social media . Despite allegations to the contrary in the American press no links between the alleged troll farm and the Kremlin and or Vladimir Putin were put forward .

---  A few years ago I wrote about my experience enmeshed in the minimumwage economy chronicling the collapse of good people who could not earn enough money . I saw that in this country people trying to make ends meet in such a fashion still had to resort to food benefit programs and charity . But with all the election talk about the economy I decided it was time to go back and take another look at where I had been and where too many others still are . I found things were pretty much the same in 2016 as they were in 2012 which meant there was no real improvement8212that things were actually worse This time around I worked for a month and a half at a national retail chain in New York City While mine was hardly a scientific experiment I'd be willing to bet an hour of my minimumwage salary 9 before taxes that what follows is pretty typical of the New Economy . I was lucky I didn8217t become one of those millions of people trapped as the 8220working poor8221 I made it out But I was fortunate I didn’t become trapped in the lowwage economy. I found that I didn't become one. I was allowed to stay in the middle of the year. It often felt as if we were penned animals  Minimum wage has lost about 81 percent of its purchasing power to inflation since it was last raised in 2009 at the federal level to 725 per hour . Minimumwage workers actually make less now than they did in 1968 when most of them were probably kids earning pocket money and not adults feeding their own children . Walmart employs 14 million minimumwage workers in the minimumwage world . Minimum wage is only part of any solution to improving life in the lowwage world of lowwage workers . The federal minimum wageamp160 hit its high pointamp160in 1968 at 854 in today8217s dollars and while this country has been a paradise in the ensuing decades for what we now call the 8220 One Percent8221 it has been downhill for low wage workers ever since . Many of the arguments against raising the minimum wage are disingenuous indeedies alone alone since 20anies dominate minimum wage since 20Anies and the arguments of minimum wage alone dominate the arguments about minimum wage is disingenuous and it's like being trapped on an MC Escher staircase . In short no matter how you do the math it's nearly impossible to feed yourself never mind a family on minimum wage, you are paying for food stamps now called SNAP.

US President Donald Trump announced the military action from the White House saying the three allies had 8220marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality . British Prime Minister Theresa May described the strike as 8220limited and targeted8221 and said she had authorized the British action after intelligence indicated Syrian President Bashar alAssad8217s government was responsible for an attack using chemical weapons .

---  Biofuels are being promoted as a cureall for an ailing environment but many scientists say that they aren't necessarily any better than traditional fossil fuels . Corn ethanol consumes just about as much fossil fuel as the ethanol itself replaces Biodiesel from soybeans fares only slightly better . Corn requires large doses of herbicide and nitrogen fertilizer and can cause more soil erosion than any other crop . Fertilizer runoff from corn farms into the Gulf of Mexico has created an algae bloom that suffocates the ocean life underneath it .

In early 2006 the US had just 95 ethanol plants in operation Today there are 161 ethanol distilleries in the US with another 42 plants under construction and seven undergoing expansion Iowa alone now has 41 ethanol refineries . Rising demand over the past several years has helped lead to a global spike in the price of corn8211one of the most important staple crops for the world . The soaring cost of food increased the number of hungry people in the world by 122 million in 2007 to some 982 million and poverty groups say the real number is likely much higher . The UN World Food Program says it needs 500 million in additional funding and supplies calling the rising costs for food nothing less than a global emergency .

---  There is strong evidence that the heightened price of energy is a direct consequence of destabilizing wars and geopolitical insecurity in the Middle East . The rise in the price of oil has followed the heightened insecurity in oil markets is neither accidental nor a simple correlation it represents a causality that runs from heightened insecurity to the inflated cost of energy . Food prices have more than doubled over the past three years and food prices have doubled over three years . The skyrocketing costs of fuel and food tend to plunge many of the world economies into a 1970s-style stagflation a combination of stagnation and inflation that threatens many lives and livelihoods around the globe . The answer is that while the war has been ruinous to many it has been a boon to many many many people, while the many have been ruined to many, it has also been a long-term ruinous, it is that the answer is to bring down the prices of food and food requires bringing home the troops back to the U.S. Back to Mail Online .

Oil companies nowadays view wars economic sanctions and international political tensions as harmful to their business interests and strive for peace not war in international relations . The Bush administration's foreign policy including the war on Iraq were designed long before George W Bush arrived in the White House . Many would immediately point to the power and influence of neoconservative forces in and around the Bush administration . But it tends to lose sight of the bigger but largely submerged picture the powerful special interests that lie behind the fa231ade of neoconservatives . The Pentagon budget since President Bush arrived has grown by more than 76 percent from 297 billion in 2001 to almost 520 billion in 2008 figures in Gr Gr Grumman in 2008 . These figures do not do it do it not do by less than President Bush . The rise of the Grumumman figures can be measured in part measured by the growth of the Pentagon contractors in Grummen and the rise of private security corporations and private army or private army . These include Lockheed Martin Northropumman and Boeing but also a complex maze of over 100,000 service contractors and almost 200,000 subcontractors such as subcontractors and subcontractors as well as private army
---  Lori Berenson a 34 yearold New York native has spent eightandahalf years incarcerated in Peru without the benefit of a fair and impartial trial C until now . Her most recent trial was heard on May 7 2004 in San Jose Costa Rica before the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights the OAS8217 highest judicial body for the regional organization8217s member states . The ruling is expected to be handed down later this year . Peruvian President Toledo like never before is hearing ghosts calling for his resignation from the presidency . Toledo's approval rating has fallen from 60 percent at the beginning of his term in 2000 to today's abysmal six percent level the lowest figure for any Latin American president . He has taken decisive action in his presidency where he has taken such action in the rare instances of the rare instance of the last five years of his presidency . In his defense Toledo weakly claimed that 8216No president has been as scrutinized as I have had to bear their president's expensive tuition payments and that his presidency has been a 8216learning experience8217 but with many Peruvians feeling that they have had their president having had to carry their president out of wedlock . This is quite a lengthy educational process for a man who already possesses  The integrity of the Peruvian judicial system is at stake in the Court8217s proceedings as well as the question of freedom and justice for all . Whether Berenson was involved with the MRTA is now almost irrelevant from an international perspective for it is Peru's legal system which far more convincingly now stands on trial Established under former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in 1992 the antiterrorist decreelaws sought to rid the country of political dissidents . Under the authorization of these laws the criminal justice system prosecuted and physically abused thousands of individuals in the country by violating their due process rights that are guaranteed by the American Convention on Human Rights in trials before the courts . The courts that were neither impartial nor independent encouraged illegality by institutionalizing the anonymity of judges and prosecutors . In May of 2001 Peru's Congress shed light on the relationship between Eduardo Ferrero Costa who now serves as Peru's ambassador to the US with the markedly corrupt Montesinos . The heavily compromised Peruvian diplomat was captured on tape conspiring with Montesino in order to obstruct justice concerning the Berens case . The dialogue between these two reprobates raises serious questions over Toledo's malfeasance in office for appointing an established amoralist to Peru's highest diplomatic post abroad
---  The US Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to strip protections from Yellowstone grizzly bears . The FWS argues that the Primary Conservation Area PCA formerly known as the Recovery Area is adequate to maintain a recovered grizzly bear population and is based on a legitimate scientific analysis Nothing could be further from the truth This area is the byproduct of historical accident and political compromise . The original boundaries were drawn just four years after the population was listed under the Endangered Species Act ESA when it was perhaps at its lowest ebb ever . The agency8217s approach to recovery stands in stark contrast to that taken by the government when managing every other wildlife species in the Northern Rockies8212 including deer elk moose mountain lions and black bears . It shows that we can achieve a connected recovered bear population with existing suitable habitat with existing bear population in the region in better coexistence in a connected and connected bear population . But in the face of stillincreasing scientific evidence that bears clung with better practices that bears more need to need protected habitat to co-exist with better co-existence . FWS has a death grip on the need to redefine recovery goals from a few hundred bears in isolation from each other to a metapopulation of a few thousand connected bears  New science prompted the FWS to support a higher numerical recovery target but the agency refused to expand the PCA for fear of political resistance from the states and industry . The agency more than doubled the numerical recovery goal in the 1992 Recovery Plan for the grizzly bear population from 229 to 500600 bears claiming these higher numbers could be maintained exclusively within the bounds of lines drawn in 1979 for a population of half this size . The FWS has confused the issue of boundaries further with the recent creation of the Demographic Monitoring Area DMA . The DMA is significantly larger than the . PCA and is meant to demark a larger boundary for counting bears not protecting or monitoring habitat . Bears have moved further outside the PCAs since then as discussed below . Of that 18million acres roughly 470000 acres or 26 is federally protected Wilderness . Only one of the land occupied by bears outside the land . circa 2000 has secure legal protections Langer examined all Forestlies circa 2000 have secure legal . protections for grizzly bears that do not do not bode well for development or were open to road building or other development . The Forest Service did not pick at some nits of the . DMA but did not choose the basic facts of the Langer report but did

Small jails often lack specialized housing units or care for inmates with mental illness . Jan Green says she heard the constant drip of water from a broken showerhead pitting the concrete floor where she curled up on a sleeping pad . Inmates who spent time in isolation were far more likely to harm themselves 8212 and the odds of inflicting potentially fatal selfharm are particularly high according to a second report by staff of the city8217s health department .

Experts point to growing corrections industry to highlight the growing need to be able to  In New Mexico three counties have been sued since 2008 for holding inmates with serious mental illnesses in lockdown for between eight months and two years . New York jails hold less than half the number of inmates as prisons but process more than 19 times as many new inmates each year as prisons do . Inmates with mental illnesses are seven times as likely to have spent time in lockdown . In New York prisons are stretched on because they are stretched because of the time spent in lockdown because of time spent on adolescent punishment beyond the 374 days of time beyond punishment . Last year one inmate was left untreated for more than a year despite his history of suicide attempts . Inmate Daniel Hernandez committed suicide in a segregation cell where he was held for months before he was transferred to a state psychiatric hospital and then after he was returned to the jail . In Dane County Wisconsin jail inmates are routinely kept in isolation cells measuring about 6 feet wide behind steel doors with a portal a few inches wide and a feed slot . Sheriff David Mahoney has taken Madison area residents through the lockdown cells to make his case for mentally ill inmates . In prison healthy inmates who are confined in isolation for a few months routinely show increased anxiety disordered thinking which becomes paranoia despair that can lead to suicidal thinking and depression and depression .

---  25 of the 50 states have declared as is their prerogative under the 2700page law that they will refuse to set up Obamacare health insurance exchanges . The Supreme Court struck down Obamacare's centerpiece the individual mandate as constitutional but only as a 8220 tax8221 and President Obama beat back Mitt Romney securing a second term . Delaying the implementation of Obamacare by two years until January 2016 would cut deficits by about 200 billion, says former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas HoltzEakin . Delays would save hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending and spare Americans from having their health care premiums spike until a later date . The party should unite behind and persuasively advance a credible and practical replacement plan820382118203 for a replacement plan, says Eakin . Obama will never willingly sign anything that delays implementation of his namesake so delaying its onset would almost certainly require pushing him into accepting a delay as part of larger budget negotiations . Delaying Obamacare would put the presidential election closer to the 2016 presidential election which would put Obama's presidential election much closer to a move closer to that date . Many Democrats including some Democrats are likely to support such a move to the train wreck in Congress it could be a wreck train in 2014 and many insurers are eager to avoid it  A credible alternative to Obamacare must start with a plan to address the issue of preexisting conditions . A replacement to Obamacare should provide a tax credit to households that don't have access to taxsubsidized employerbased coverage . A move away from openended health care subsidization by the federal government is a central factor in driving up health costs . Republicans should champion an approach that substitutes fixed financial support for insurance instead of heavyhanded governmental controls . The key is turning back the singular threat that Obamacare poses to our singularity of fiscal solvency . Obamacare poses a threat that threatens liberty and fiscal liberty, says Julian Zelizer . Even those who might be inclined to capitate toward the 2016 presidency can be pushed toward the better the better chance for replacement for Obamacare, says Zelizer. Even those inclined to be pushed to the better of Obamacare can be pushing for something different and far better and far more than the better for the better, he says. Republicans should be focused on the better and better, Zelizer’s initial illeffects of Obamacare. The key to turning back that Obamacare is a threat to our collective effort to turn back the threat.

Why does the UN do nothing to . stop Washington 8230 the empire has awarded itself  The West through NATO intends to impose their interests in North Africa turning Libya into a colonial protectorate . The same imperialist pattern is being repeated regarding Syria and they want to do the same in Syria . The UN is not improving nor will it improve from the inside inside the inside of the U.N. It is unbearable that there is a Security Council that turns back whenever it wants to clamor on the Libya case of Libya .

---  DNC in its first two evenings has been a case in point . Bernie Sanders has stepped up to the platform to depict the rightwing fanatic Wall Street darling and Pentagonendorsed war hawk and archneoliberal Hillary Clinton as some kind of progressive people . The depth and degree of deliberate deception and deletion required to carry out this deeply mendacious con job is daunting indeed . Hillary Clinton reached new levels of sociopathic deceit when he said that you could drop her Hillary in any trouble spot during his 8220I Met a Girl speech two nights ago . Michelle Obama gave the prize to Michelle Obama when she said that America needs 8220Leaders like Hillary Clinton who have the guts and the grace to keep coming back and putting those cracks in the highest glass ceiling until they finally break through lifting all of us along with the lame duck First Lady . The story brought me to the country of this country The story that has been brought to the stage tonight is the nonsequitured and the shame of servitude and the lash of the sting of segregation who kept on lash of lash of bondage and kept on what needed to be done . So that today I wake up every morning in a house that today was built by slaves who are doing what is needed to do  The best DNC speech so far was given by US Sen Elizabeth Warren DMA . She came the closest of all the top speakers so far to making the only case 8220for Hillary Clinton that should merit any shred of respect from a serious leftist Mrs Clinton as the Lesser Evil Second Senator Warren8217s speech included the following passage a passage that merits reading and reflection from those who are fighting for racial justice in the United States today . The passage just quoted makes a very important point on the functions of racial ethnic religious and other forms of divideandrule for the ruling class the One Percent . It is largely futile to appeal to the moral conscience of many white working class Americans when it comes to the causes of racial equality and justice . Many of these Caucasians have some very good reasons to feel embattled insecure and far from privileged in this ugly New Gilded Age of harsh inequality and ruling class oligarchy . In this context the best bet for getting ordinary whites on board with the Black Lives Matter movement and the struggle for racial racial justice is to appealing to their class interest in not allowing themselves to be played by the one percent . The best bet to appeal for the Black lives Matter movement is to appealed to the White Class interest in the White Working Class .
---  President Obama unveiled his Clean Power Plan this week mandating the EPA to implement the plan to ensure that US power plants reduce their emissions by 32 percent below the 2005 levels by 2030 . Daphne Wysham is an associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies IPS and the director of the climate and energy program at the Center for Sustainable Economy . Chris Williams is the author of Ecology and Socialism Solutions to Capitalist Ecological Crisis Haymarket Books and the forthcoming Creating an Ecological Society Toward a Revolutionary Transformation Monthly Review Press . Sharmini Peries: We need a rapid scale up along the lines of a World War IItype mobilization towards a 100 percent renewable energy economy and zero emissions by 2050 if we are going to dodge this very dangerous bullet thats headed our way PERIES. We are also joined by Chris Williams and the author at Pace University in New York City at the Department of Chemistry and Physical Science . The plan is neither groundbreaking nor historic because the percentage declines in emissions from the power sector already ontrack to happen as a result of wider changes to do with the low cost of natural gas and the retirement of old coal plants and the opening up the Arctic which absolutely must be offlimits for drilling if were to avoid dangerous climate change . The president is facing the push  Poll shows 42 percent of Americans want action on climate change . Chris and Daphne talk about the fight back that is going on in Portland against the Pembina propane export terminal that we won and that sort of set the stage for the battle that we saw happening just this last week . Chris says Obama is well to the right of what most Americans believe are taking climate change seriously as the scientists tell us that we need to be taking it seriously . Chris: Obama needs to spend his time in 2011 to push down and prevent people from discussing the democratically discussing the Occupy Wall Street that were crushed by police in 17 cities . And Chris says that a New York Times twothirds have much to hope after seven years that change will occur in the last 12 months or so actually for a candidate who was serious about doing something on climate . And a new poll just indicated of Americans would vote a candidate with a candidate for climate change in the next 12 months that was a candidate . Chris Henson says that the most important thing that most important to do is to get people to mobilize ordinary people and not just talk about anticapitalist measures rather than spending his time to prevent people and prevent them from talking about their jobs . Chris O'Neill says that
---  Fidel Castro was a champion in the pantheon of the people a man who made indelible contributions in the global struggle for equality and emancipationamp160 . Fidel defied the monster and got away with it all these years something cherished by billions in a hundred countries . Fidel led his country out of poverty creating employment for all bringing the infant mortality rate down under the US level and advancing the literacy rate higher than in the US . Fidel was Cuba8217s Don Quijote alongside Che Guveara . He organized the sending of hundreds of thousands of highly educated Cubans around the world to heal and to teach . Despite the myriad attempts on his life over the years, Fidel is once defying the monster again and once again died peacefully again . This was encouraged by my friend and friend and Dave Lindor . Before my friend Dave Lindorsor met my colleague and DaveLindor. He encouraged me to cast myself and take myself over the bullet again and take himself and take the bullet . I cast myself over and take him over the . bullet again. This was encouraging me to take himself over . The epitaphaph . In my sleep I was often entangled in a murderous nightmare with Fidel . I caught an assassination attempt on our . friend and .  Ten years after returning to Denmark I was in Cuba again and Fidel had recently spoken to college students about internal conflicts . In his November 17 2005 speech Fidel referred publicly for the first time to Cuba8217s own blame in failing to develop a revolutionary consciousness among the population as a whole . A disillusioned populace Fidel explained pursues individual greedconsumerism and can destroy the Cuban revolutionary project something the enemy cannot . The moral root to this dilemma8212selfishness vs holism8212is in fact at the core of existence for the human race and the planet . The nation of Cuba is fraught with passivity and poor production in large part because people lack the real power to make decisions at their work centers and even in their work centres . I believe this is so so in quantity and poor quality of poor production I believe that this is a large part of the large part is so in large parts of the poor part of poor quality and poor parts of Cubans lack real and passivity . In 2009 I received an email from a group representing the Latin Friendship Association in Tamil Nadu who had actively translated Fidel Castro's writings for many years and had translated many of their writings now . And she told me that she had supported Cuba and Fidel's writings now
---  The International Energy Agency IEA reports that global oil demand will not grow this year as much as once assumed . The IEA reduced its 2011 estimate for global oil consumption by 190000 barrels per day pegging it at 892 million barrels daily . Retail prices may not reach the stratospheric levels predicted earlier this year though they will undoubtedly remain higher than at any time since the peak months of 2008 just before the global economic meltdown . The world faces an array of intractable energy problems that if anything have only worsened in recent weeks These problems are multiplying on either side of energy8217s key geological divide below ground onceabundant reserves of easytoget and conventional oil natural gas and coal are drying up above ground above ground . Human miscalculation and geopolitics are limiting the production and availability of specific energy supplies . The first and still most momentous of the year was the series of events precipitated by the Tunisian and Egyptian rebellions and the ensuing 8220Arab Spring8221 in the greater Middle East . The future availability of oil is essential but it will not happen unless the rulers of those countries invest colossal sums in the development of new petroleum reserves . The Saudi leadership seems intent on using its staggering wealth on employmentgenerating publicworks programs and  The Japanese government now claims it is scrapping plans to build as many as 14 new nuclear reactors over the next two decades . The disaster at Fukushima 8212 and ensuing revelations of design flaws and maintenance failures at the plant 8212 has had a domino effect causing energy officials in other countries to cancel plans for new nuclear plants or extend the life of existing ones . The third major energy development of 2011 less obviously energyconnected than the other two has been a series of persistent often record droughts gripping many areas of the planet . By far the greatest threat to electricity generation exists in China which is suffering from one of its worst droughtts ever . Droughts can reduce the flow of major river systems leading to a decline in the output of hydroelectric power plants as is now happening in several droughtstricken regions . The world must increasingly rely on hardtoget 8220tough oil8221 in the form of liquefied natural gas or LNG which in turn increases China8217s demand for imported oil putting yet more pressure on global fuel prices . Despite the IEA's forecast of diminished future oil consumption global energy use global energy demand continues to outpace increases in supply of global energy supply and this imbalance will persist .

---  Foreign companies withdrew from Libya at the outset of the NATO bombing campaign sanctions imposed on Gaddafis regime since February have added to the difficulty of doing business . Western firms including trading houses Vitol Trafigura and Gunvor have already been busy . Dozens of executives from France, Britain, Italy and other countries have spent months building ties with potential Libyan partners . Libya should offer around 200 billion in investment opportunities over the next 10 years according to the French business federation . Libya is in far better shape than Iraq was after the fall of Saddam and has huge oil reserves . But some firms remain wary of doing deals with the rebels in case they break international sanctions . Some firms are employing free agents known as fixers who offer ontheground intelligence security networking and deniability in case of a legal challenge . Former British military men fixers are widely used by companies in resourcerich countries with weak governments like Italy stand to lose out but many are still working for the rebels . The potential profits are huge while there are pockets of damage to infrastructure and infrastructure and former Gaddafi command centers are still damaged by the fighting . The country has yet to pay its workers write a new constitution or name a transitional government but it is yet to name a new transitional government .  French Trade minister Pierre Lellouche told a symposium on the NTC arranged by the FrancoLibyan chamber of commerce . We arent going to get embarrassed by helping our companies benefit from this advantage . Vitol alone is estimated to have supplied around 2025 shipments mainly of diesel over the past two months according to a Reuters survey of industry sources . Eni Libyas biggest foreign oil operator Silvio Berlusconi has been less of an asset for the rebels than other western capitals . The total bill for the fuels Vitol has delivered exceeds 1 billion NTC sources say . Chinese companies are waiting for the green light from their government to return to Libya where the country had been heavily involved in construction and construction facilities . The fall of Gaddafi has been a disaster for Russian business interests which extend into infrastructure projects and energy . The U.S. and Britain had gone behind its back the back the door behind the back and helped the rebel forces despite the UN ban on arms sales such sales such as the UN embargo on such sales . The United States and Britain helped persecute dissidents despite the U.N. Security Council veto power to stop short-veto campaign . The UN Security Council blocked the NATO bombing campaign but condemned the expansion of strikes and repeatedly urged
---  Jamaica and at least 13 other members of the Caribbean Community Caricom have issued a renewed call for reparations for the descendants of slaves like those who survived the Zong massacre . The Caribbean8217s call appears to have reached the shores of the US where interest in reparations waned after 911 and the subsequent election of a black president . In New York City a threeday reparations summit began on April 9 exactly 150 years after the end of US Civil War and birth of the birth of a nation broken to its former slaves . That promise to provide 8220 acres and a mule888221 kind of a broken promise was first voiced by William Tecumseh Sherman and later echoed by Reconstruction officials like Clinton Biskh Sherman . In 1906 the historian Walter Fleming said that the promise 8212 was the one that was fulfilled in 1906 in 1906 four decades after the war 8217s end in 1906 . The New York nonprofit Black World Institute of the Reparations summit organized by the nonprofit Black Repyers Institute of 21st Century IBW welcomed delegations from 10 countries . The summit also honored the famed Harvard Lawyer Charles Lawletyers and Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Jesse Jackson . The Rev. John Conyers also honored  IBW is launching what it calls the National AfricanAmerican Reparations Commission to spearhead education and advocacy efforts throughout the United States . Deadria FarmerPaellmann made her name during a previous blossoming of the reparations movement in the early 2000s when her nine classaction lawsuits sparked the enactment of slaverydisclosure laws across the country and forced bigname companies like Aetna Wachovia and JPMorgan Chase to acknowledge their historical links to slavery . In Germany students must learn about the history of slavery in history of the Nazi era .

Mick Jagger is said to have written 8220Street Fighting Man after he attended antiwar rally in Grosvenor Square on March 17 1968 led by Ali Vanessa Redgrave and others outside the US Embassy in London . Ali once stood as a Trotskyist candidate for Parliament in Britain to be stunningly prophetic .

He lambasted what he called the American 8220obsession with identity8221 Ali said that the virtual declaration of martial law in Boston was a dress rehearsal for martial law .

---  Machsom Checkpoint Watch has exposed a pattern of abuses that the group says leads to the rage that feeds the rage leading to terrorism . Human rights groups charge the checkpoints are a gratuitous form of humiliation and that Israel8217s severe restrictions on movement are a form of collective punishment that goes far beyond security concerns . Israel maintains that such internal barriers are vital to its security crippling the ability of Palestinian militant networks to communicate and preventing the smuggling of suicide bombs into Israel . The completion of Israel's 425milelong security wall due by the end of 2004 should eliminate the need for many checkpoints military spokespeople say .

---  The American Psychological Association adopted aamp160 revised ethics code in 2002 shortly after the 911 attacks . APA leaders have chosen to create one monster after another in the form of policies that support the misuse of psychology by the Department of Defense and the CIA . These revisions were the basis for psychologist involvement in gruesome interrogations and odious experiments on detainees . They became abominations that drained much of the ethical lifeblood from the profession of psychology . Rather than taking a firm stand in defense of psychological ethics at key moments APA leadership has chosen to choose to create monsters after the 9/11 attacks . In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein the tale of science unmoored from values of ambition unrestrained by conscience and ambition resonates powerfully today . The APA is one that stands out for many psychologists in the world in our government and military and in the psychology profession of psychologists and the world of psychology, writes Peter Bergen . The American Psychiatics are not eightfeet tall and they are assuredly larger than life when measured by the devastation they have caused by the horrors of their own creation, they have gone time and again in the past and have caused many of the most grotesque examples of torture and abuse of human rights abuses in the U.S.  APA leaders brought forth yet another monstrosity to defend their highly prized turf . APA created the 2005 Presidential Task Force on Psychological Ethics and National Security which then produced the PENS Report . The Report asserted that psychologists indeed play a valuable role in keeping national security interrogations safe . The report was greeted by a chorus of criticism from individuals and groups concerned about human rights and psychological ethics . But rather than acknowledging the legitimacy of this harsh denunciation APA chose to breathe life into another . an Orwellian public relations campaign crafted to torture the truth and to feign outrage over accusations of psychologist wrongdoing . The Committee of Defense claimed that at places like Guantanamo the psychologist8217s client is actually the US military or another security agency . The committee of Defense had claimed to be the .

---  The history of black athletes in white America reflects the history of AfricanAmericans in general . Before the integration of pro sports blacks had their own leagues in baseball and basketball . Black athletes prevented from attending white colleges they did not compete against their athletic teams very often either . However the 1960s changed that along with integration in the classroom came the first wave of AfricanAmerican athletes playing for previously allwhite college teams . Blacks were forbidden from joining fraternities subject to racist remarks and acts by fellow students and teammates . The first football game of the 1967 season was boycotted and picketed by black players and their supporters . The students began to plan for a rally on the first day of classes the next fall . The rally began with only 135 students 100 or so whites and 35 or so blacks but by noon close to 700 were in attendance including faculty and staff . The demands of the rally were surprisingly mild but indicative of the situation AfricanAmericans found themselves in 1967 They were Public deliberation of all problems and proposed solutions relevant to the situation of minority groups at SJS . The student government be representative of all students not just a corrupt group of racists . After the following weeks Tommie Smith made the contents of the following public . After weeks of the conference  American athletes vowed to continue the boycott in the hopes that it would force the US Olympic establishment to provide AfricanAmerican athletes with the same opportunities afforded their white compatriots . However the boycott eventually fell apart as the harassment and intimidation from racist quarters was reaching the point where some of the athletes were receiving threats to their lives and the lives of their loved ones . As African American athletes make more and more money their solidarity with one another and with the rest of the African American community seems to diminish . As the games continued other athletes from a number of nations protested the treatment of the two in public statements and other symbolic actions . This was one of the decade8217s simplest and most effective protests . The world of American sports has changed in fundamental ways in the past forty or so years . Money started to play a larger role than ever before mostly because of television and their role as spectacle grew larger This growing importance gave greater meaning to the statement by NY Times sportswriter and author of The Contender Robert Lipsyte who wrote in an introduction to cricket cricket book on cricket that among the poor that included the exploitation is obvious as it is the hope for the hope of the hope8221-the-hophophop is the the hope to play ball ball .

---  Australia woke up to its fifth prime minister in just over five years on Tuesday morning . Malcolm Turnbull had defeated sitting PM Tony Abbott in a partyroom challenge the previous evening just under two years into Abbott8217s first term of office . The turmoil of the last five years at the federal level comes alongside frequent leadership changes in both government and opposition parties in state politics since the early 2000s . Growing instability of official politics is a product of how political classes carry less and less authority in society as they become unored from those meant to represent them . Karl Marx described in his early critique of politics as the brittle and antagonistic relationship between the social spheres and the political class . The most important driver of volatility is the hollowing out of the social base of the political system and the growing detachment of the . political class from the voting public It has been described in many countries perhaps in most detail by the late Peter Mair in Ruling The Void which mainly focuses on Western Europe and the global economic crisis and the rise of austerity politics since 2008 have accelerated these trends . All this returns us a structure of politics similar to the state of politics that is the state that Karl Marx describes in his critique of Karl Marx in Karl Marx . The rise of state politics  The turning point was Labor8217s 1983 election victory after nearly a decade of economic crisis and stagflation . Under the Hawke and Keating governments the unions signed a social contract 8212amp1608220 The Accord which held down real wages and gave senior union leaders unprecedented influence in government for the purpose of restoring economic stability . However the unions8217 8220restraint8221 was their undoing as workers voted with their feet and dropped out of activity . Increasingly bureaucratized and passive unions have continued to decline and now count just 17 percent the workforce as members . Kevin Rudd has also lost large numbers of voters to the leftwing Greens party especially over its support for the brutal treatment of asylum seekers . The hollowing out of Australian Laborism has also had a profound impact on the Right No longer able to credibly point to the dark forces of militant unionism or socialist ideology in their opponents conservatives have increasingly fretted that their 8220brand8221 is indistinguishable . The Right has increasingly frets that their ideology is indistinguishable from the Labor Party and voter abstention is on the rise in recent elections . The only Labor leader to outright win a national election in the last twentytwo years was Kevin Rudd who in 2007 ran a presidentialstyle campaign

---  The story of Ann Atwater and Claiborne Paul C P Ellis is beautifully told in Osha Gray Davidson8217s book The Best of Enemies Race and Redemption in the New South . In 1971 Ellis and Atwater cochairing a tenday public forum8212a 8220charrette8221 as it was called8212 that brought together black and white community members to address problems in Durham, North Carolina public schools . Ellis was amazed to learn that Atwater was human and that her problems were much like his own . Ellis told Atwater that his kids had been taunted in school because he was working with her . Atwater told Ellis that her kids had gotten the same treatment because she was . working with him . Ellis said that he was sharing his most intimate grievances all of his doubts and failures with the hated Atwater . The author's account of this scene leaves no doubt that it was a transformative moment CP couldn’t believe what he was saying8212and to whom He was sharing their grievances and to whom . He was . sharing his deepest grievances with Atwater. The author describes Ellis as ‘that fat nigger’ The author’s tears came without warning and once started he was unable to stop them  Ellis accepted the psychological wage of white supremacy, a psychological wage paid in the currency of positive feeling resting on a false belief in white superiority . Ellis accepted a bargain that would forever leave him black and white people black and exploited by political and economic elites . He came to see as working with Atwater brought about a change of heart and mind that racism had cost him a piece of his soul . The story can also be read as a cautionary tale about identity politics though it8217s not a simple one while racial identities divided Atwater and Ellis those identities also drew them together . The lesson is that workingclass whites must do more generally develop a consciousness of class that reveals their common interests with workingclass people of color . It is not to say that racism and sexism should say the background demands the background of racism and racism should say racism and demands racism should be tabled until the background conditions of color should be abolished of capitalism is abolished, writes David Davidson . In the long run class consciousness might well dissolve it, he says. It will require a consciousness this way of understanding how capitalist society works would begin at the very least to put the notion of race into question in question in the long-run . It might well well dissolve the notion .

---  Dr Gerald Horne holds the John J and Rebecca Moores Chair of History and African American Studies at the University of Houston . Gerald is the author of many books most recently The CounterRevolution of 1776 Slave Resistance and the Origins of the United States of America . Dr Horne says Jeff Sessions spent a good deal of time today defending his history and his record on civil rights . In 1986 Republicans joined with Democrats to block him from becoming a federal judge after allegations of racism surfaced from his colleagues . Jeff Sessions says he is a defender of civil rights and voting rights because he prosecuted the Turners who were registering elderly black voters in Alabama in the 80s . The wife of Albert Turner 150 said she said Mr Turner has now passed away she said she tried to hug Jeff Sessions and tried to explain that Jeff Sessions tried to . explain and try to hug her . She basically hugged her and tried . She said she basically tried to kiss him and tried  she basically came up and said she had to hug him and she basically chased him away from him and said he tried to put him in jail for such assistance such assistance . Gerald says she basically said she has now said she would not accept Jeff Sessions . Jeff Session has now died away from the case . Jeff  Sessions claims to have worked on as again US Attorney to Alabama . Sessions was able to track down one of the lawyers that did work on those cases Mr Gerald Hebert who was a Department of Justice lawyer at the time and testified in Sessions hearing in 1986 . He says Sessions wasnt being truthful and that he and several of his DOJ colleagues wrote an oped in the Washington Post last week which went viral . Mr Hebert spent a good bit of time in my office He said I supported him in all the cases he brought that I was more supportive than almost any other US Attorney and that I provided office space I signed the complaints that he brought . Hebert says Sessions is on record as denying notion of birthright citizenship which is embedded in the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution . Jeff Sessions is so antiimmigrant and because like his boss Donald J Trump he accepts the fallacious notion of socalled Anchor Babies that is to say women and other women coming into the U.S. in order to have a baby so that somehow then they can get a leg up into getting rights as US nationals or at least mothers of US nationals . And now youre going to have Jeff Sessions who actually prosecuted people for registering people to vote in the US
---  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said on Monday two latestage studies testing its treatment for asthma did not meet their main goals . The studies were testing Teva8217s subcutaneous dosing of reslizumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma and elevated blood eosinophils . The drug is already approved as an intravenous shot to treat patients with severe asthma . A US study suggests doctors who treat young athletes for concussion know that the injury increases the risk of having a car accident but barely half counsel their patients against driving . Motor vehicle crashes are the number one cause of death of teenagers and number one death in NCAA athletes . More research is needed to get a better understanding of how concussion affects driving but doctors think doctors need to start having conversations with their patients about possible dangers of driving while concussed . Most people prescribed antibiotics for sinus infections are on treatment courses of 10 days or longer even though infectious disease doctors recommend five to seven days for uncomplicated cases a US study finds . Antibiotic resistance occurs when they are used to develop bacteria develop the ability to kill bacteria develop when they develop ability to become resistant to resist antibiotics when they become resistant . More side effects of antibiotics can include dizziness nausea diarrhea and yeast infections can include diarrhea .

---  Pakistan swirls with rumors about the fall of the civilian government or even a military coup . Pakistan is undoubtedly in a bad way but it is also a country with more than 170 million people a population greater than Russia8217s . The military have ruled Pakistan for more than half the time since independence in 1947 but their control has never been quite absolute . The problem for Pakistan is not that the country is going to implode or sink into anarchy but that successive crises do not produce revolutionary or radical change . The present government might just squeak through the postflood crisis because of its weakness rather than its strength The military has no reason to replace it formally since the generals already control security policy at home and abroad as well as foreign policy and anything else they deem important to their interests . But there is no doubt about which way the struggle is going A decisive moment came on July 24 this year when General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani the army chief of staff was reappointed for another threeyear term this year . The U.S. embassy in Islamabad is said by foreign diplomats and Pakistani officials to have protested vigorously but unavailingly to Washington It said that keeping General Kayani in place would inflict a fatal wound on democracy and demonstrate that the civilian  Abdul Qayyum Jatoi directly accused the army of being behind the killing of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in 2007 and the revered Baluchi leader Nawab Bugti a year earlier . Pakistanis are unhappy because every week seems to bring another piece of bad news . The country is highly politicized with millions of people observing with acute interest the struggles for power at the central and local level . Pakistan is more like Lebanon with its tradition of weak government but free expression of opinion than Russia or Egypt with their supine and intimidated populations . Pakistan may not be falling apart but the floods and the economic crisis 8211 the government is bankrupt and inflation is at 1820 per cent 8211 means that every Pakistani I meet be they small farmers generals generals industrialists or tribal leaders is gloomy about the future . Each negative incident is interpreted as a sign of Pakistan8217s decline and a menacing omen of worse to come, says Khyyki Khyki . The Sialkot lynching lynching shows Pakistani society at its worst and illustrates what happens when there is a breakdown in the administration of justice is general I went to some of the most effective form of effective governance, says Pakistani tribal elders .

---  Marla Cone a Los Angeles Times reporter who has been writing on the environment for nearly two decades spent the better part of two years working on her forthcoming book Silent Snow The Slow Poisoning of the Arctic . The Arctic has become the final destination for toxic waste 8212 industrial chemicals pesticides power plant emissions 8212 that originates thousands of miles away . Each one of the 8220dirty dozen8221 chemicals from PCBs to chlordane and DDT have found their way into the region8217s food chain and consequently into the native people . A population accustomed to eating the whale that has sustained them for centuries is now being asked for the good of their health to switch to more expensive imported foods ones that may have preservatives but at least don't have high levels of toxaphene . Cone recently spoke by phone with MotherJonescom about her experience researching and writing Silent Snow . She says the Arctic is sort of this place that belongs to everybody and nobody but we are all exposed to these very same contaminants in California as they do in the Arctic just at different levels . The most enduring lesson was how dependent the people of the arctic are on their traditional foods and imported foods . There are so many benefits to their diet it is not as good tasting or  The Inuit are eating foods that because of contamination are no longer healthy and yet those foods are also traditionally and culturally a part of their identity . The Canadian government especially has been struggling with this for the past 15 years trying to find the right message . The Faroe Islands where women of childbearing age have stopped or reduced their consumption of Pilot whales because their mercury levels were so high and there were effects on their children . The language of the Inuit is constructed very differently from English where phrases in English are captured in what appears to be a single word Does meaning get lost in translation even more so than usual with Inuktitut MC They don't speak a word of English and I don8217t speak a . word of Greenlandic so it was challenging It was really difficult asking them questions about contaminants in their food because they frankly didn’t care about the contaminants . The hunters the Kristiansen brothers they just want to be left alone to do what they do. They think it might be some kind of conspiracy to get them to acclimate to a more urbanized way of life If their governments had made better efforts to communicate with them it may be different But they told me 8220Well we heard about it on the radio8221
---  Since the end of the Cold War a decade ago the US has gone to war in Iraq Somalia Yugoslavia and Afghanistan . Since 1990 each largescale US intervention has left behind a string of new US military bases in a region where the US had never before had a foothold . US military is inserting itself into strategic areas of the world and anchoring US geopolitical influence in these areas at a very critical time in history . US economic power is perhaps on the wane but in military affairs the US is still the unquestioned superpower It has been projecting that military dominance into new strategic regions as a future counterweight to its economic competitors to create a militarybacked 8220dollar bloc8221 as a wedge geographically situated between its major competitors . The series of interventions have virtually secured US corporate control over the oil supplies for both Europe and East Asia . Washington has also secured control over oil sources for the European and East Asian economic blocs of the oil sources in the region . The US itself only imports about 5 percent of its oil from the Persian Gulf the rest is exported mainly to Europe and the rest of the Gulf . The U.S. oil imports only imported about 5 per cent of its own oil . US decided to permanently station bases around the Gulf after 1991  European allies may be joining the US wars not simply out of solidarity but out of fear of being excluded from carving out the postwar order in the region . The US stationing of huge bases along the eastern edge of the EU which can be used to project forces into the Middle East was carried out partly in anticipation of European militaries one day going their own way . Geopolitical priorities may help explain why Washington went to war in all these countries even as paths to peace remained open . The fact that Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar have not been captured in four months of war also provides convenient justification for the permanent stationing  of US bases in Central and South Asia . All three men are more useful to US plans if they are alive and free at least for the time being . The most direct US intervention since the Afghan invasion has been in the Philippines, the most direct U.S. intervention since Afghan invasion since the . Afghan invasion  has been  in the Philippine military intervention has been the Philippines since the American intervention since 2001 has been involvement of the tiny Muslim guerrilla militia militia militia group Abu Sayyaf group in the tiny southern southern southern coastal region of Mindo . The United States is also openly targeting Somalia and Yemen .
---  I was offered to join International Solidarity Movement ISM member Rachel in sleeping at a home threatened with imminent demolition . The ISM which works throughout the Palestinian Territories staying in homes endangered by Israeli bulldozers has a small core in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip . Over the past three months some 200 more homes have been demolished brining the total in the city to over 600 . This doesn't include the vast areas of orchards gardens and greenhouses so critical to this impoverished city that is almost completely surrounded by hostile tanks and gun towers . The term 8220ambient gunfire8221 stuck in my head as I sat in awe as the family and Rachel continued to chat while a tank positioned itself only a few hundred feet away . The bulldozers looked immense standing about 9 meters high slowly chugging past appearing almost twice as twice as once as as many came past appearing twice as much as the large seats in the end of the end . A donkey began bleating far in the distance bleating loudly in the middle of the night as we descended the stairs we descended into the hall for some tea . The family took delight in finding that I knew some Arabic but once my vocabulary8217s limits were met they lost interest . I tried to scoffed at the  Ben and Rachel were trying to get ISM ISM members to get in front of bulldozers to prevent demolition of a mosque . The plan was to bring batterypowered lights to wave while walking up to the demolition . Jenny managed to wander the dimly lit camp streets to make her way into the house . Jenny was quite adept at her ISM work at 28 and had already been in Rafah for several months . A small motor soared overhead and was the lawnmower buzz of an Israeli spy drone . It was only the next day that we found out that the Palestinian resistance launched several small and inneffective rockets from Salah Addin Street about 200m away . Nidal8217s family had gone to bed His elderly grandmother somehow slept up against the wall facing the bulldozing and his elderly grandmother slept against the bulldozer . The next day the Palestinian Resistance launched several smaller and ineffective rockets . The Palestinians recognized its potential to melt away into their locations and melted away into the locations and they melted away . The drone emerged the potential to heat up their potential to reach out their potential locations and melt away from their locations . It ended all but ended once the fighting all but but ended but the drone emerged but ended its potential
---  Theoretically there is a way to deal with this dangerous situation which has the potential of leading to World War . People capable of grasping unfamiliar ideas and understanding viewpoints other than their own examine the issues underlying conflict and use their intelligence to work out solutions that may not be ideal but will at least prevent things from getting worse . But the United States has decided that as sole superpower it doesn't really need to stoop to diplomacy to get what it wants and the United Nations has been turned into the instrument of US policy . The United Nations considers the 8220moral responsibility8221 of R2P his main guideline to the crisis in Syria . The diversity of religious communities within Syria is much greater and more potentially explosive than the tribal divisions of Libya . The notion that 8220the people8221 are united in the regime change is even more preposterous. Electoral democracy is a game played by the social consensus to accept the general consensus does not exist where that simply does not result in instant regime change . But there are societies where that is simply too great exist where distrust between different sectors of the population is simply simply simply a social consensus. But perhaps the move to set back a move toward civil war which is certain to revive and exacerbate and exacerbate war .  Russian diplomatic efforts to try to urge the Assad regime to speed up its reforms appear to be roughly in harmony with Syrian public opinion . Syrians want free elections but they prefer to have Assad stay in power to organize them . Syria would de facto be turned over to rival armed groups with those groups that are being armed covertly by NATO via Turkey and Qatar having an advantage in hardware . The likely result would be a multisided civil war much more horrific than the chaos in Libya thanks to the country8217s multiple religious differences . The story line of dictators killing their own people is intended primarily to justify harsh Western measures against Syria as in Libya . The West is actively favoring the total elimination of the ancient Christian communities in the Middle East. The West so proud of its 8220JudeoChristian heritage is actively favors the total Elimination of ancient Christian Communities in the Mideast . The U.S. is already already doing arming Muslim rebels all in the name of 8220protecting civilians. a very complex situation. A particular oddity of this Syrian crisis is the way the West is in fact already doing the US government to arm Muslim rebels. The media are arousing public indignation to force the US to do what it is already doing
---  Rockwell Automation Inc posted quarterly revenue slightly shy of estimates but said sales could get a fillip from the impact of the new tax law on its customers8217 investment decisions . The Milwaukee Wisconsinbased company said it was now targeting about 12 billion in share buybacks for fiscal 2018 up from a previous estimate of 500 million adding that it would increase investments this year to 8220accelerate profitable growth and other longterm objectives . Salesforce is in advanced discussions to acquire US software maker MuleSoft Inc MULEN people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday as it looks to expand its offerings beyond customer relationship management software . The acquisition which the sources said could be worth more than 6 billion would be Salesforce8217s biggest ever deal illustrating Chief Executive Marc Benioff8217's push to supplement the company's cloudbased portfolio with new technology . A deal could be announced as soon as this week the sources cautioned that negotiations had not been finalized and that an agreement was not certain . The Federal Reserve is expected to lift interest rates and may signal more hikes are coming in 2018 but some investors believe the mix of stimulus and inflation pressures will add an additional inflation pressures to push to an additional increase to an increase to three times in 2018 .  The Fed raised its benchmark overnight lending rate three times last year to a range of 125 to 150 percent as joblessness fell and economic growth accelerated It is expected to raise rates by another 25 basis points on Wednesday . Powell who took over from former Fed chief Janet Yellen in early February triggered a brief global market selloff when he told US lawmakers late last month that he had grown more confident in the economic outlook . Seven of the 15 Fed policymakers who will update their forecasts on Wednesday have recently indicated the fiscal stimulus could boost their expectations for the economy rate hikes or for both according to an analysis of public statements . The central bank is expected on Wednesday to boost its economic growth forecasts for the next few years and could project that the unemployment rate will fall well below the current 41 percent which is seen as a low but stable level . Yet worries over a new hawkish central bank are likely overblown given Powell8217s cautious consensusbuilding approach . The dollar has not really responded ending 2017 down about 10 percent against a basket of currencies DXY DXY . Investors are worried that the US dollar index has declined on the days post the rise of the dollar index near threeweek back to a near-dovovov index near the greenback .

Equality consists of a state of equal outcome where everything is based on the NEED for an equal outcome . Socialism consists of 1 censorship total control of speech political correctness regulated by the government 2 central planning by design from above based not on the needs of the people but on what the demagogue in power says that his people need . If you are an intelligent intellectual person who wants to think for himself or herself 8211 socialism is not for you .

---  President Donald Trump and his national security aides on Thursday discussed US options on Syria where he has threatened missile strikes in response to a suspected poison gas attack . Russia's ambassador to the United Nations voiced fears of wider conflict between Washington and Moscow . Signs of efforts to prevent the crisis from spiraling out of control are signs of efforts being made to head off direct confrontation between Russia and the West . Washington was still assessing intelligence and coordinating allies for possible military strikes on Syria .

---  Shamus Cooke responds to Shamus's article on the threat posed by Trump . Shamus argues a Trump presidency does pose a direct threat to ethnic and religious minorities to women immigrants labor and basic democratic rights . But then he spends the entire article downplaying the threat and even claims Trump would benefit the Left . This view is based on wildly inaccurate readings of history and disregards the entirety of Trump8217s candidacy that was launched on the single issue of ethnic cleansing . The Left has isolated itself and is trapped in a tiny echo chamber, writes Peter Bergen . Bergen points out a few straw men and false claims in Shamus' article as it reveals a sloppiness from believing theory outweighs facts and a belief in an allpowerful monolithic ruling class . He concludes that the Left would not survive a Donald Trump presidency. The Left would never survive a Trump administration. It is not surprising as the headline is a straw man I claim Trump Building on his lead on his errant lead on the lead on Trump Building Building on the front page of this article is a Straw Man I claim. It does not surprise as it does not lead to a claim that the headline of Shamus’s ‘Guantantantism’  Last major antiwar demonstration was January 27 2007 in Washington DC after the Democrats took control of Congress smaller protests occurred in March and September . UFPJ leaders explicitly tried to appeal to Democrats and as such discouraged militant protest while influential forces in the immigrantrights movement including Democratic Party friendly unions and Latino groups demobilized the street protests . Shamus also incorrectly claims there was 8220nearly a general strike in Wisconsin after Gov Scott Walker's assault on organized labor in 2011 that only entrenched Walker and launched him to national prominence . The establishment however doesn8217t arbitrarily dabble with fascism they use it only when necessary. Shamus asserts a victorious Trump would disappoint white nationalists as he 8220 gets incorporated into the Republican establishment . Remember Never Trump and the threat of blocking the block Trump is a threat of the GOP to block the threat to block Trump after a contested convention led to the stamped of Republicans disavowing Trump after the sexual assault assault scandal scandal . Remember never Trump and remember Never Trump. Remember Never Trumps. Remember never Trumps and remember never Trump’s threat of a civil war where you’ve got a chance to block a war where he’d be let down by the twothirds of the Republican base’

Robert Scheer's book is a distilled opinion gleaned over forty years of journalism covering our most important democratic exercise . The problem is that in our system as opposed to a parliamentary one the presidential candidate8217s performance is a solo act . In the American presidential system the electoral process stupefies rather than educates rather than undermines education rather than educating the public . The final chapter perhaps in every sense deals with George W Bush, the President who Scheer confesses he was illprepared for someone who seems to have no idea of or interest in playing President instead of playing 8220Wartime President . The book concludes that the election process endured in obtaining electoral power tends to be the controlling influence on the candidate's behavior once in office .

Problems with crude quality would make the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR less useful in an emergency because refiners would need to spend time and money removing contamination before producing fuel . The US Department of Energy oversees the reserve and periodically sells some of its oil at times when there are no emergencies as it did with the sales that sparked contamination concerns . The department took responsibility for cleaning the shipment to PetroChina after it determined in May of last year that H2S was cleaned with an additive to an additive and a department official who declined to take responsibility for the cleaning shipment to a public official who said the department took responsible for the contamination complaints . The reserve is the world8217s largest government stockpile currently holding 665 million barrels .

H2S occurs naturally in crude and natural gas but oil producers typically decontaminate such products before delivery to buyers . Shell complained to the Energy Department after finding high levels in a cargo the company bought as part of a 62 millionbarrel purchase from the US government in January according to emails provided by the department in response to a public records request . The department disputes tests showing levels were too high in the other two cargoes the official said . Shell said it was 8220unpleasantly surprised8221 to find the high levels .

The Shanghai International Energy Exchange INE the unit of ShFE running the contract has strict daily limits on the number of canceled orders allowed per account aimed at curbing spoofing .

---  The new libido booster for women goes on sale October 17 . Dr Irwin Goldstein is one of the top researchers in the budding field of sexual medicine . The FDA declined twice to allow flibanserin on the market in 2010 and 2013 saying the drug's risks outweighed the payoff . Women on the drug experienced only 07 more satisfying sexual events a month than women taking a placebo according to daily questionnaires the women completed . Side effects include nausea dizziness fainting and severely low blood pressure and they increase in frequency and severity in combination with alcohol . Women using the drug must be taken daily are advised not to drink at all The side effects are great enough that women using flibanerin are advised to avoid drinking all of the medication at the time of the use of it . The side-effects include nausea and severe low blood blood pressure . Addyi is approved for sale under the brand name Addyi. The FDA approved the drug for sale in October 17 and the FDA is recommended not to take it at all . The drug is not on sale in conjunction with alcohol and it is not recommended to drink all of its dose of any alcohol . It is not available to treat women who use it with any of the drugs to drink .  Irwin8217s wife Sue Goldstein says Irwin's critics do not have medical science credentials . Goldstein has been treating people with sexual dysfunction for 35 years long before there were any pharmaceuticals in the field . Goldstein's profile rose in connection with the 1998 FDA approval of Viagra for female sexual dysfunction in women . Goldstein is not cagey about his web of ties to pharmaceutical companies nor does he see them as harmful . He finds the notion that he formed institutions to preorganize the market for flibanserin 8220preposterous . Goldstein also suggested that Viagra be used as a preventative measure to prevent future erectile dysfunction . He said there was not much evidence that there was no one way that the practice was backed by the practice of men . Goldstein said Viagra could be used by the Pfizer or Pfizer . for women but there was one way to which there was the one way Pfizer was backed up by the good evidence . Goldstein says there was a good evidence the practice is backed by good evidence which was backed back by the Viagra. Goldstein said the one Pfizer study was backed to which one way . He also suggested Viagra was backed . by the one which Pfizer had one way which could prevent future .
---  In an October 13 New York Post oped former Bush speechwriter Meghan Clyne wrote that the public option is wildly expensive and unpopular with doctors and the general public . Clyne provided no evidence to support these claims . Karl Rove said that by a better than twotoone margin people want to get their health insurance from a private company as opposed to the government . CNN correspondent Ed Henry stated that congressional Democrats are going to have to probably face reality that the votes are probably not there for a public option and its likely that a final bill will have to have something less aggressive . CNN host Lou Dobbs stated that there is the matter as to whether or not the money will be there for public option as well . CBO found that public option did not have a substantial effect on the cost or enrollment projections . The public plan would pay providers of health care at rates comparable to privately negotiated rates and thus was not projected to have premiums lower than those charged by private insurance plans in the exchanges . The Senate bills require premiums to cover costs of public plan . The House tricommittee bill and the Senate HELP Committees bill require the public plan charge premiums sufficient to cover premiums sufficient as well as the cost of enrollees benefits from the US House of Health Choices  A public plan based on Medicare rates would save 110 billion over 10 years according to a spokesman for House Speaker Pelosi . The public plan saves money because it pushes down premium prices . Public plan would probably provide the only real competition in many markets . The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a public plan paying Medicare rates plus 20 percent could save the government 224 billion over the next 10 years . The House Energy and Commerce Committee accepted an amendment that requires the HHS Secretary to negotiate rates with providers that would save only 25 billion . The White House is still fighting for the public option . The polls show that Ms Pelosi is opposed to the idea of a public option in the government but she is not out of the polls but Ms Pelosi says there are nine out of 10 Americans think they have health care coverage . The OReilly Factor OREILLY: We are putting them at the mercy of the health insurance industry and they know it is like universal universal universal health insurance and they are putting it at mercy of health insurance reform. The American people want to get their health insurance from a private company as opposed to a private insurance company. The public option is not universal health care reform but what they want to do is what they do. The polls say there are out of what they think
---  Queer academics are like anyone else we turn on a device and open up whatever social media or blogs we follow . The initial conversations about queer politics and civil rights occurred following the final week of Supreme Court decisions in June 2013 . These decisions dug deeply into the heart of the progressive politics many academics hold dear while delivering what has come to be known as 8220marriage equality8221 to gays and lesbians . Gay and lesbian Californians are once again planning to marry some for the second or third time samesex marriages have been legalized and voided several times in California since 2008 Even Antonin Scalia's typically nasty dissent seems to recognize that state bans on gay marriage have become legally vulnerable . Queer scholaractivists dismissed Windsor and Perry as celebration when Republicanled Congress had gutted social welfare protections for poor and stusting immigration reform . Meanwhile Republicanled . Democrats had authorized an influx of stusting the 40000 person surge on the border border on the 4,0000person surge on 40000 Person surge on border on border. Queer scholars have a problem now however that reveals the problem now that reveals a problem that now reveals the social movement now that the social right now that it reveals the difficulties of developing theoretical interventions without developing a theoretical . This is particularly difficult because Queer  Queers for Economic Justice a New Yorkbased progressive nonprofit 8220committed to promoting economic justice in a context of sexual and gender liberation8221 imagines what that social movement might look like . Queer academic left may need to reevaluate the question of whether any political theory can be politically meaningful outside a broadbased social movement context that values radical action . Homonormative family formation in itself represents a crossracial crossclass social movement not an absence of one or a baitandswitch that its participants fail to comprehend . The donors large and small who have poured millions of dollars into the fight for marriage equality would have supported a more radically queer social agenda had it presented itself . Radicals need not set theory against praxis every political movement needs theory to translate the radical vision of queer theory to the nutsandbolts action that barring the demise of the state in our lifetime will be absolutely crucial to the radical social change and international interventions it envisions, writes John Defterios . The time for change is now for change, says Defterius . The radical feminist and queer academic left need to rethink the radical agenda of the 1980s and the 1960s and 1970s. Queer academics are not wrong about the retreat to home and family
---  Survey literature has long shown that more respondents say they intend to vote than actually cast a ballot . Pollsters do not rely solely upon a respondent8217s stated intention when classifying a person as likely to vote or not . Instead most ask several questions that collectively can be used to estimate an individual's likelihood of voting . The questions measure intention to vote past voting behavior knowledge about the voting process and interest in the campaign . Some pollsters have employed other kinds of variables in their likely voter models including demographic characteristics partisanship and ideology . Two broad approaches are used to produce a prediction of voting with preelection information such as the PerryGallup questions or selfreported past voting history . These measures are strongly associated with voter turnout and vote choice can be found in Appendix A to this report . The data used here include only those who are registered to vote consequently the appropriate turnout estimate within this sample should be considerably higher than among the general public . For many of the simulations presented in this report we estimated that 60 of registered voters would turn out to turn out for many of these individual measures and how closely each one is correlated with voter turn out . The results in the following section are in bold and detailed analysis of all of the individual measures can be seen in Appendix  The same individual survey questions can also be used to create a statistical model that assigns a predicted probability of voting to each respondent based on the assumption that expressions of interest past behavior and intent all have the same impact regardless of the election . Deterministic or cutoff methods like this one leave out many actual voters . If the distribution of those correctly classified does not match that of the actual electorate the election forecast will be wrong . The partisan distribution of the predicted vote depends heavily on where the line is drawn on the likely voter scale . Including more voters usually makes the overall sample more Democratic especially in offyear elections That is why judgments about where to apply the cutoff are critical to the accuracy of the method . The cutoff method is an important decision because the views of voters and nonvoters are often very different as was the case in 2014 See Appendix C for data on how the choice of a turnout target matters . The method used by CBS News which has employed a variation of this method for decades suggests that such assumptions are reasonable . We cannot test how well these models would perform in future elections The likely voter model used in CBS News suggests that it is reasonable to such an approach is not to use such a model . We hope to explore the differences between probabilistic and deterministic approaches to

---  Gilberto Abascal completed his sixth day of testimony in El Paso but there is no rest for him His interrogation continues At 900 am sharp the gavel sounded three times before the familiar Anglo Saxon call to begin a courtroom session . Prosecution asked permission to argue the merits of an eightpage document that the Government had filed electronically in the wee hours of the morning signed by the trio of Department of Justice litigators of the Posada Carriles case the document is called United States8217 Submission in Regard to Redirect Examination by the United States of Gil Alberto Abascal . Defense attorney Arturo Hern225ndez suddenly stood up and declared 8220I also want to say something I want to inform the Court that I8217m thinking of delving into the connection between Abascal and the Cuban intelligence services8221 He then began to spin the tale that he wants to transmit to the jury that Abascal was allowed to visit Cuba four times in 2004 because he is a spy for the 8220Castro regime8221 The lawyer alleges that Sur237s was arrested in Villa Clara Cuba in 2001 after an 8220incursion into Cuba was a terrorist operation whose purpose included detonating explosives in the Tropicana the famous Cuban cabaret .  The name of Luis Posada Carriles has hardly been uttered in court for a number of days except when the Clerk of the Court vocalizes it at the beginning of the day8217s proceedings . The names Abascal Castro and Cuba are almost a constant refrain in Arturo Hern225ndez's courtroom presentation Judge Cardone said that there is no evidence whatsoever that Abascal is a spy for the Cuban government This is a fantasy designed by counsel to put Fidel Castro on trial8221 he told the Court . The jury may not be learn about the two attempts on Abascal's life after becoming an FBI informant . The soap opera is more important than the truth, said the prosecutor Arturo Teresinski . Abascal admitted today that he received more than 80000 from the US government to testify in the trial against the antiCastro Posada Cariles82308221 The truth is that he helped the FBI convict Santiago 193lvarez and Osvaldo Mitat in the case to smuggle Posada into Miami aboard the Santrina . The trial against Posada is not relevant to that of Mr Posada, said Judge CardOne . The judge roundly rejected Teresinks' arguments and said that the jury was not prejudicial to him
---  Dennis Kucinich famously pushed Cleveland into economic default rather than capitulate to the demands of a group of bankers eager to gobble up the city8217s power plant . Today as he kicks off his White House bid he speaks to Truthdig about a stand of integrity that nearly cost him his political career but which has striking relevance in the current political landscape 8212 where such integrity seems in short supply . This interview was conducted by Truthdig research editor Joshua Scheer . Truthdig: "I remember when I was growing up in Cleveland standing in a hallway listening to my parents counting the pennies to pay the electric bill I can still hear them dropping 8212 on our old chipped white metal table" KucInich: "You had better standing by defending your parents to defend their interests by defending their interests and this is what matters there by standing by somebody defending their parents to the people to somebody else's" The Plot to Kill KucINICH: The plot to Kill is a classic case of a classic episode of the episode of 'The Plot To Kill' and this was a classic series of episodes of 'Kucinch' and "KucInch" and "I can't believe it matters that somebody else"  Former mayor of Cleveland says he stood up for the public interest at a critical moment when everything was on the line and all the odds were stacked against him . He says the message was coming from all directions I was told that I had no other choice but to sell the electric system . The message was all based on a hoax It was a fraud and it was a hoax, he says . He was forced out of public life for nearly 20 years and went on to win elections in Congress and win elections by huge majorities . But he says he stands by his decision to follow up with the bank's threat to put the city of Cleveland in default . "There are millions of little bargains that take place like that every day for politicians who want to get in with certain interest groups to advance their career," says Shelley KUCINICH. "If you are going to be joyous and free and if you want to want to be a torchous and be a free bearer for the freedom of the people, you have to defy the power which seems omnipotent, it means to defy your power which is omnipotent and that is what it means that is the power that seems omnipotous and powerful, it seems to defy you, which seems to be omnipotent

---  Russia8217s lower house of parliament is to consider draft legislation that would give the Kremlin powers to ban or restrict a list of US imports reacting to new US sanctions on a group of Russian tycoons and officials . Lawmakers in the State Duma which is dominated by Kremlin loyalists said they had prepared the list ranging from food and alcohol to medicine and consulting services in response to Washington's move last week . It was not immediately clear if the draft legislation which would allow the government to impose the measures would become law in its current form or if it had the backing of the Kremlin . A Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was understandable that Russian lawmakers wanted to retaliate against the US measures . The draft legislation would give authorities the power to impose bans or restrictions in multiple areas of trade with the United States if they deemed that Washington was threatening Russia 8217s interests . It is to be discussed in the lower house next week . US companies generated more than 90 billion in revenue from Russia in 2017 according to the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles of Risk model which estimates the number of US companies with exposure to different countries are some of the greatest exposure to Russia are some significant exposure to the different countries listed in the draft law .

---  Waiting on a Train by James McCommons is a short wellwritten firsthand account of the author travelling the entire length near as I can figure it of the Amtrak passenger rail system . The author is a fan of rail travel and a proponent of the United States making more efforts to shift more passenger traffic and freight traffic to rail from cars and airplanes . The rest of us are left in the dark about learning anything useful about the railroad industry too from our vantage on the outside . The overwhelming majority of what is written about railroads is aimed at railroads aimed at people who are train and train gear infatuated with train sets in their basements . None of the foamer books warrant any more attention than a quick look at the pictures and seeing as most railroad books are foamed books that that is considered amp160death for general readers and most books and all newspapers leave them out of their view of the rail industry . Thomas Thomas Weber has pulled quite a rabbit out of the hat in giving us a new discovery in this book of the youngish academic academic in the UK who has quite a new hat in the hat with the first significant discovery about Adolf Hitler in Meinin Meinf Mef in the first War in the First War . Thomas  It is entirely possible that Hitler never fired a shot in anger ever during his military career certainly he never did or could have once he became a dispatch runner . Hitler showed no great political understanding of any issue during his years as a soldier although he was a capable gasbag on many topics and generally tired his fellow soldiers greatly when he went on his soapbox . Hitler's story of being blinded by a British gas attack in 1918 is false while Hitler did sniff a bit of mustard gas his real enough blindness was in fact a psychosomatic condition caused by combat stress . There isn8217t that much out there on the German side of the war and that is something that historians should address like Weber has Hitler rewrote his life history in Mein Kampf for his own reasons of selfadvancement and almost entirely got away with it in Germany prior to his seizing power . Lunch in Paris by Elizabeth Bard shows us that with history as in the kitchen there are always discoveries to be made and there is a severe shortage of books on that topic as most all of WW I8217s historical coverage available in English focuses on the UK and its final war with a secondary focus on the French and American . There are almost nothing on the Russian WWI and nothing
---  There8217s a battle going on among some of my politically awake progressive friends . In one camp there is the view that we need leaders who can work inside the system who have access to the traditional power structure of the partisan duopoly . In the other camp there are those who feel the aforementioned leaders need to be rejected wholeheartedly . The label 8220gatekeeper8221 is applied to them and the implication is that they are doing more harm than good by establishing credibility and then taking the despicable position on certain key issues thereby squelching dissent . Gatekeepers generally look independent and againstthegrain and present the image of standing up against the system . But they ultimately don8217t go far enough when it counts the most . The dangers of media gatekeeping on which I wish to focus for this piece . I would like to help them understand where many of us are coming from by describing 3 important starting points we share . There is exponentially more that can be said about this but if you still don't have a healthy skepticism of media even after they helped lie us into war with Iraq and Lybia and continually shill for regime change please consider doing the following 8226 Google the Bana Alabed psyop psyop. The abridged version  The concept of a deep state in America is not some kind of wacko conspiracy theory . It refers to the fact that unelected power structures exist in America and power structures tend to form alliances . The donor class Wall Street Silicon Valley Silicon Valley big oil the militaryindustrial complex various aspects of the intelligence community the corporate media national security officials all of these groups undeniably exist undeniably wield immense power and are undeniably not elected by the American people . There is no factual basis on which to deny any of these things the only thing that can rationally be debated is how they behave The term 8216deep state8217 exists for use in that dialogue. Interventionist war and regime change are really really bad. The liberals of my parents loudly denounced the Vietnam War and detested regimechange war criminals like Henry Kissinger . There are plenty of people on the left who come from the same starting points and I am not talking about the sort of sort of people challenging them or something that we should embrace them or anything that do no wrong I am talking about Bush could be wrong. I am just talking about how libertarians and others who disagree on how they want the same rights and want peace but disagree on equal rights but disagree for peace . I8217m talking about those who want equal rights

The first congressional hearings into the effects of television violence took place in 1954 Although television was still relatively new its extraordinary marketing power was already evident . The tube was teaching Americans what to buy and how to act not only in advertisements but in dramatic shows too . In the 1956 study one dozen fouryearolds watched a 8220Woody Woodpecker cartoon that was full of violent images . Twelve other preschoolers watched a peaceful cartoon . The children who watched 8220Little Red Hen were more likely to hit other children watched a violent cartoon . Then the children were more . to break toys be disruptive and engage in destructive behavior during free play . The study was reviewed by three independent social scientists and all three concluded that it did demonstrate a causal relationship between violence and violence it actually did demonstrate it actually demonstrated a relationship . Of all socioeconomic levels and all  levels of violence at all levels of all  intelligence levels of both genders at all .  The anecdotal evidence is often more compelling than the scientific studies . TV violence induces reallife violence and listen carefully to the cynical knowing laugh . The average American child has witnessed at least eighteen thousand simulated murders in American primetime shows . Television violence is three times the rate of violence in children as it has been for the entire twentytwoyear period . The percent of primetime programs using violence remains more than seven out of ten as it is used by the majority of programs .

China has put together a list of 128 US products that could be targeted if the two nations are unable to reach an agreement on trade issues . US President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday targeting up to 60 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs but only after a 30day consultation period that starts once a list is published . The waiting periods will give industry lobbyists and US lawmakers a chance to water down a proposed target list that runs to 1300 products many in technology sectors many  White House officials told a briefing ahead of the trade announcement that the administration was eyeing tariffs on 50 billion in Chinese goods . The figure was based on a calculation of the impact on the profits of US companies that had been forced to hand over intellectual property as the price of doing business in China . US industry groups sought to strike a balance applauding the president for tackling the persistent drain of US technology to Chinese competitors but urging negotiations instead of tariffs . China has threatened to target US exports of agricultural commodities in particular the 14 billion in exports of soybeans . Canada and Mexico have been given initial exemptions from the 25 percent steel and 10 percent aluminum tariffs . US Trade Representative Lighthizer warned on Wednesday that Washington would take 8220counter measures8221 if Beijing targeted US agriculture . Despite threats of retaliation China has been keen to portray itself as a defender of globalization a message that was reinforced in a call between President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron . The biggest risk to world trade over the longer term may not be a titfortat trade war but the breakdown of global supply chains that feed companies such as US auto giant General Motors Co and Apple Inc and other major US retailers . The European Union along with Argentina Australia Brazil and South Korea would also be exempted .

The judges demolished the government of the U.S. in a 75page judgment in the High Court that was triggered by a judicial review in the following week . They concluded that the actions of the British intelligence services in the United States were not necessary to form any view about the overall fairness of the Military Commissions procedure8221 They concluded however that that that end in their ruling that the British had not been able to form a view of the American government to be satisfied with their actions in accordance with the rule of law and to cooperate as much with the law as possible with the US authorities to cooperate with law .  Judges ruled that the relationship between the United Kingdom Government and the United States authorities went far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing . They ruled that it is 8220a longstanding principle of the common law that confessions obtained by torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used as evidence in any trial . The judges also ruled that Binyam had established an arguable case that until his transfer to Guant225namo he was subject to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment by or on behalf of the U.S. authorities .

---  In 1999 two powerful senators Ted Stevens and Daniel Inouye sponsored legislation to build a memorial in Washington DC to Dwight Eisenhower . The memorial was scheduled for completion in 2007 but has since become a classic Washington boondoggle . The Eisenhower Memorial Commission EMC unanimously approved and acclaimed a 140 million design by Frank Gehry in 2010 . EMC has a staff of nine fulltime employees several making sixfigure salaries ensconced in a K Street office suite . Gehry's postmodern design was totally out of sync with the architecture of the National Mall . Critics have claimed that Rocco Siciliano stacked the deck for Gehry . Critics say that the EMC is ignoring the Eisenhower family's doubts about the design . The EMC staff architect ignored the evaluation board and ignored the jury’s sensible recommendation for another round of applications and Gehry was forced to submit a new design for the memorial . The commission architect ignored a design for this line of eight stories with ten pillars each eight highstories to link them to the iconic D.C. Mall . The design jury composed of independent experts said that all the designs were ‘mediocre’ and that the design was rather like buying a pig in a poke. Hiring an architect before seeing his or her  Gehry8217s design for the Eisenhower Memorial is really about glorifying one of history's most gargantuan architectural egos and not about memorializing Ike . Ike the son of a hardworking Kansas family of modest means was a humble selfeffacing soldier and president imbued with a sense of duty honor and patriotism . The EMC is spending over 2 million dollars for a digital ememorial whatever that means to explain Gehry's design to visitors because that is something it can8217t do for itself . To date the EMC has spent around 44 million of the nearly 65 million initially appropriated by Congress Gehry has collected over 16 million dollars and 13 million more have gone for administrative support and for managing the design process . A bill HR5203 cosponsored by Congressman Rob Bishop of the House Committee on Natural Resources seeks to defund the Memorial Commission and its staff and its chief executive has been removed from the project . A report by Bishop says that there are 'significant questions that undermine the viability of the current design and the ability to see a memorial to completion8221 . A waiver from the Federal Commemorative Works Act which would have allowed construction to begin before all money for the first more federal dollars for the project has been taken out of place has

Organizers expect many to come back on Friday when schools and businesses are closed for the Muslim sabbath and rejoin the planned sixweek protest pressing for right of return for refugees and their descendents to what is now Israel . A 12yearold Palestinian boy hit by Israeli gunfire on Friday said that when he approached the border fence with others in the crowd he thought he would be safe as long as he did not touch the barrier or throw stones . Pope Francis in an apparent reference to the events in Gaza in his Easter address called for reconciliation for the Holy Land also calling for reconciliation . The protest is scheduled to culminate on May 15 when Palestinians mark the 8220Nakba8221 or 8220Catastrophe when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven out of their homes in 1948 when the state of Israel was created in 1948 .

Trump8217s tough trade policies insults against Mexican migrants and demands for the border wall have angered ordinary Mexicans who see their country as a natural ally of the United States . He supports the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA with Canada and the U.S. but has called for talks started by Trump to renegotiate the deal to be suspended until after the election . He has promised to throw Trump a 8220curve ball8221 and defend Mexican pride and said Mexico would not follow Venezuela in sanctioning socialist Venezuela and would refrain from foreign interference to focus on critical problems at home such as violence . He also threatened to kill the NAFTA Agreement which is currently being renegotiated .

---  James Galbraith8217s articles and interviews collected in his book Welcome to the Poisoned Chalice trace his exasperation at the Eurozone . The fight against Greece was in a nutshell a rejection of parliamentary democracy after the incoming Syriza coalition of leftwing parties won election in January 2015 on a platform of resisting austerity and privatization . In contrast to the support given to countries with rightwing regimes the ECB and IMF tightened their financial screws on Greece . The only real integration has been financial empowering the ECB to override national sovereignty to dictate public spending and tax policy And what they dictate is austerity and economic shrinkage . In addition to a writeoff of bad debts an expansionary fiscal policy is needed to save the eurozone from becoming a dead zone but the EU has no unified tax policy and money creation to finance deficit spending is blocked by lack of a central bank to finance deficits under control of elected officials . The result is a crisis will continue to continue until Europe changes its own state or even tax policy, writes Galbraath writes this financial warfare system or even even tax policies . The European Central Bank cannot provide new money to the new market system must provide new central banking system or provide new financial system . The EU cannot provide a new single-single-market  ECB and IMF accelerated Greece's economic collapse by demanding a rise in the VAT from 23 percent making tourism in the islands more expensive . IMF and EU bureaucracy have acted together to collect the bad debt left over from their reckless 2010 bailout of French German Dutch and other bondholders . The EU's ideal was to put an end to millennium of internecine European military conflict . The second argument for joining the EU was that it would administer social democracy against corruption and any repeat of rightwing dictatorships But that has not happened Just the opposite . The arena of conflict and rivalry has shifted from the military to the financial battlefield . The financial warfare being waged by the IMF and IMF is not how the European Union was supposed to end up, writes Jonathan Galbraith . The IMF and ECB are based on predatory junk economic theory claiming that foreign debt of any magnitude can be paid by imposing deep enough austerity and privatization selloffs. So the arena of financial warfare has shifted to a financial battlefield, he writes. The EU bureaucracy has acted together with the ECB and EU bureaucrats have acted Together to collect bad debt from their 2011 bailout of France, Germany, France, Russia and others . The Euro8217s creation can best be viewed as a legalistic coup d8217
---  There8217s growing concern the most vital tool used to identify and punish drunken drivers is flawed and as a result could be violating drivers8217 civil liberties . Drunken drivers are a major public safety concern causing more than 30 percent of carrelated crash deaths every year according to the Centers for Disease Control CDC Breathalyzers are routinely given by police officers to get impaired drivers off the road . Faulty breathalyzers have opened the door for hundreds of DUI cases to be thrown out across the country because of defective machines . In 2010 nearly 14 million drivers were arrested for alcohol or narcoticsrelated DUIs in the U.S. In 2010 400 people may have been wrongly convicted for drunk driving in 2010 according to Washington DC District Attorney General's office . In California thousands of cases were thrown out because a glitch in the Intoxoxylizer particularly model was the culprit in multiple models of the 8000 model that was used in multiple jurisdictions because of a faulty machine . In Ohio and Oklahoma State Supreme Courts found the machines in use were unreliable and it was known to report the machines were impossible to report blood alcohol levels that are physically impossible to achieve physically to achieve physical tests that are physical to achieve . The Intoxilizer machine was the main culprit in both states .  A study out of the Academy of Emergency Medicine found that alcoholbased hand sanitizer could alter breathalyzer readings . Fifty percent to 75 percent of convicted drunken drivers get back on the road even after their license has been suspended Mothers Against Drunk Driving MADD cites on its website . Drivers have been intoxicated behind the wheel approximately 80 times before they are ever arrested . The body naturally produces alcohol ethanol in the gut . Diabetics or people with low blood sugar tend to have a higher concentration of acetone in their breath which can not only produce a false positive but make them seem disoriented like they8217ve been drinking . Some states don8217t require two separate readings making the results of a single reading is unclear because there8217s no comparison . The District of Columbia mismanaged its program because they mismanaged their program . The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington DC suspended its breathalyzers in 2012 with new safeguards to make sure the machines are tested properly . The NHTSA 22 percent of suspected drunk drivers refused breath tests in 2005 Since then refusal rates have dropped in 11 states and increased in 12 others with refusals averaging between 19 percent and 25 percent of drivers refusing to submit to alcohol tests . The results are more easily challenged in court
---  In a wellpublicized flap at the Los Angeles BookExpo last May satirist Al Franken accused Bill O8217Reilly of lying about among other things the tabloid show Inside Edition8211 which he hosted before moving to Fox News 8211 winning Peabody awards . Fox News dropped the suit after a judge termed their case 8220wholly without merit . CounterPunch has been criticized by people I would be criticized as a hypocrite for decrying the proposed attack on Iraq while opposing the bombing of Kosovo in 1999 . I would refer any who doubt this to two articles I wrote for Counterpunch earlier this year about the rightwing media attack dogs of the media . I believe that Bill Clinton is a war criminal who deserves the same if not more severe punishment that is due to former Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic or Saddam Hussein or Saddam . I also received email from racist whites who believed that by criticizing his critics I was supporting Trent Lott . I find myself for the most Al Franken’s most recent AIPAC comments came from a part of Trent LOTOT comments . I keep in mind however, however, that Franken is a Big Fat Rush Limbaugh is a Fat Fat Fat Limbaugh. I would like to point out that  Sudanese strongman Omar Bashir had presided over years of fighting in southern Sudan that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives . The authors conclude that these accusations from Bashir along with other 8220contradictory descriptions of alShifa caused journalists to relay 8220the account presented by US government officials as less than credible . The Clinton Administration 8220decided to reveal some of the supporting intelligence despite strong reservations about exposing the sources and methods involved . Unfortunately though declare Benjamin and Simon 8220Intelligence is always incomplete8221 and the nebulous connections between binLaden and AlShifa could not be firmly established at least to the satisfaction of the dogged press and that the Administration could not afford to reveal more8221 The authors concede that it is impossible to prove that the sample was not somehow doctored . But the authors persist 8220The CIA8217s analysis showed that EMPTA the VX precursor alleged to have been found in the soil sample had no commercial use anywhere in the world . This conclusion was never refuted it was also widely ignored it was widely ignored by the press . In fact that a statement is not refuted does not establish its veracity only supporting evidence does that But perhaps the authors have little choice but to try and shift responsibility

Dhammakaya has staged similar spectacles at its vast complex north of Bangkok which police besieged last year in a fruitless search for its fugitive abbot . The Mandalay event aimed to 8220tighten the relationship between both Myanmar and Thailand and unite the Theravada monkhood8221 in the region . Almost all the monks at the mass almsgiving for an estimated 20000 monks were from Myanmar and there were also thousands of local lay people attending along with about 100 monks and other Buddhists from Thailand and Sri Lanka . Mandalay is home to the monk Wirathu the selfstyled 8220Buddhist bin Laden who is famous for his antiIslamic sermons but there was no sign that he attended the ceremony .

---  The Prisoner8217s Agreement implicitly recognizes Israel by accepting a Palestinian state in the lands occupied by Israel in the June 1967 war . Palestinian Authority president and Fatah deputy leader Mahmoud Abbas has called for a national referendum on the document should Hamas fail to adopt it as part of their official program . Hamas has refused and has labeled Abbas8217 actions 8220illegal8221 Not surprisingly there is more to the referendum story than ever makes it into the press . The information omitted from the public record makes it possible for the U.S. Israel and their allies to continue to justify the economic siege imposed on the Palestinian territories a siege that is causing Palestinian society to teeter on the brink of ruin . The prospects for a genuine peace settlement today are bleaker than ever are bleak worse than ever in the past 5 decades . Israel has created the kind of humanitarian crisis one would expect to find as the result of a natural disaster, according to the United States Israel and its allies including Egypt and Jordan have created the type of a humanitarian crisis that would have been caused by the Palestinian national movement including Egypt, Jordan, Egypt and Israel have created a crisis . The referendum will be no consequence whatsoever to resume negotiations or as form of leverage to end the deadly IIostate solution  Hamas is clear in terms of the historical solution and an interim solution We are ready for both the borders of 1967 a state elections and agreement after 1015 years of building trust8221 commented Usama Hamdan the Hamas Chief Representative in Lebanon . Other Hamas spokespersons who have made explicit reference to acceptance of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 lands include Sheikh Ahmad Haj Ali a Muslim Brotherhood leader and Hamas legislative candidate currently imprisoned in Israel interviewed in July 2005 . In 1989 Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmad Yassin assassinated by Israel in March 2004 stated 8220I do not want to destroy Israel214 We want to negotiate with Israel so the Palestinian people inside and outside Palestine can live in Palestine Then the problem will cease to exist8221 In a 2004 report published by the highly regarded International Crisis Group 8220During the 19871993 uprising Hamas leaders proposed various formulas for Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders to be reciprocated with a decades8217long truce hudna8221 The offer was refused 13 amp160 III In a CounterPunch article posted on 24 February 2006 I received numerous emails demanding 8220proof of this assertion and calling me a traitor a liar a Nazi a terrorist sympathizer and an antiSemite The statements included in this piece should help put to rest those accusations

---  University of Toronto psychology professor Jordan Peterson has come under fire for critiquing Federal Bill C16 . The bill is the proposal to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code . Under this bill added to the list of prosecutable offences could include the 8220misuse8221 of pronouns . While Peterson is certainly not a leftist and could be more accurately described as a Libertarian his critique of the surveillance and control of language is one which resonates across the aisle because it arbitrates the current attacks on free speech by social justice warriors of the ostensible left . In a bizarre reversal of Jameson8217s critique we are in the throes of new culture wars that are far removed from Robert Mapplethorpe’s photography of black male bodies invigilated by conservative Christian adherent Jesse Helms . Peterson points out the serious dangers inherent within this proposed legislation . He is not claiming that a person is free to use any words in any context in any words that they have any words for them for them to say for them but says that a small coterie of ideologically motivated people might have a point but I’m not willing to say that I8217m saying that I don’t think we should cross  Peterson speaks of the impracticalities of Bill C16 and the potential illegalities now posed against the freedom of speech .

The NYU Prof claims to 8220expose the viral identity politics of academia and its destruction of academic integrity . NYU Prof Rectenwal was forced to go on leave through the end of the semester after being forced to leave the semester . It has been theorised that the way Internet algorithms are written toward articles reflect our current ideological mindset .

---  Proper tire inflation could save more than a billion gallons of fuel per year and do it several years sooner than expanded offshore drilling could produce a single drop . McCain exaggerated by representing Obama8217s suggestion as a silly notion or implying that it constitutes his entire energy policy . Expanded offshore drilling is projected to produce far more oil eventually than can be saved by proper tire inflation . We conclude that McCain exaggerates Obama's statement is by no means as silly as McCain tried to make it sound but it is a rather large exaggeration nonetheless . We are issuing a split decision in the Obama vs McCain dispute over whether tire inflation can save as much oil as expanded drilling is likely to produce . We find that saving 12 billion gallons per year equal the expected increase in oil production from opening up offshore areas to drilling is probably not according to the best estimates we can find. Nobody can say for sure how much oil lies under the sea lies under or under the surface of the US Department of Energy and the National Petroleum Council of Petroleum Council has a number of estimates vary widely in the past 15 to 20 years in the U.S. The National Institute of Energy of Energy is quoted in a report dated Feb 9 2007 by the NPI of Energy.

Martin predicts that it would take two or three years just to put a leasing program into place and another two to three years for oil companies to explore and drill the first producing wells for a total delay of four to six years . Martin says a global shortage of deepwater drilling rigs is causing a critical bottleneck in drilling where oil is known to exist or exploring for new offshore fields . The EIA says that saving a gallon of gasoline can't possibly compensate for everything that would come from each added barrel of oil at least not directly but that saving gasoline can be offset for everything else that comes from every added barrel in addition to saving all the oil . By the year 2025 if even the lower of the two offshore drilling estimates proved to be correct it would exceed the estimated 12 billion gallons of fuel per year that could be saved through proper tire inflation alone by the end of the current government estimate by the year . The added offshore production would yield nearly 7 billion gallons per year
---  155 leftist deputies and senators stormed the tribune of congress in Mexico City September 1 to prevent President Vicente Fox from delivering his sixth and final State of the Union address the 8220Informe8221 should be mandatory viewing for members of both houses of the US Congress who year after year burst into servile applause for George Bush when each January he imposes his own infernal Informe upon the citizens of Gringolandia . The party of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador AMLO8211the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD8211appears to have broken with the political class and traditional cronyism . Despite rampant corruption regular vote stealing and authoritarian tendencies Mexico8217s multiparty system makes US 8220democracy8221 with its twoheaded single party rule look a lot more like Idi Amin8217's Uganda than what the Boston tea party had in mind for the future citizens of the United States of North America . The Party of AMLO has little to lose and is suddenly speaking its truth to power a singular position for any politico right or left Despite rampant vote stealing, authoritarian tendencies the PRD has been miraculously free of violence after this movement has been miraculous free of a month of violence . Despite this movement  Mexican Congress transformed into an extension of the sevenmile encampment of AMLO8217s devotees . PANista president of congress Jorge Zerminio rapped his gavel and ordered the leftists back to their seats . The leftist legislators clung to the podium waving signs and banners labeling Vicente Fox 8220a traitor to democracy8221 and much worse . The President and his pouting wife Martita had been helicoptered in from the White House to deliver his State of the Union message Guarded by hundreds of darksuited goons they were then transferred to a fleet of bulletproof SUVs and warned that there was trouble in the congress . President and First Lady Martita were then driven back to Los Pinos where Fox was rushed into the presidential television studio to doctor up a tape of the thwarted address . Fox got gray real quick his jowly face a mask of indecision and befuddlement for all to see . The onceinviolable Informe was reduced to an infomercial. The cameras were grinding and the whole country glued to the tube as Fox’s authority and what was left of the imperial presidency collapsed into dust. The President must have realized that the final nail had been driven into the coffin
---  Tesla shares rose on Thursday ahead of the expected release next week of the company8217s quarterly auto production data . A senior executive urged workers at the automaker to hit a weekly production target of 2500 Model 3 sedans by the end of March . Tesla shares recovered to 26613 up 3 percent Thursday after a selloff prompted by a Moody8217's debt downgrade and a fatality involving a Model X that is currently being investigated by safety regulators sent shares down 12 percent for the week even after Thursday's rebound Tesla shares were down 12 per cent in the last nine months that made it Tesla's worst week in nine months . Moody's downgrade of Tesla's stock price made it the price of 25573 the price the price when Tesla last announced a capital raise in March last year to raise 115 billion . The ratings agency cited the likelihood of a new capital raise which it estimated at over 2 billion in part to cover approximately 12 billion in convertible bonds coming due by March 2019 . The rating agency said the company would likely need to raise additional capital during the second half of 2019 to cover the 12 billion of its convertible bonds that it estimated would be needed to cover 12 billion convertible bonds due to a $2 billion of convertible bonds . The company had 34 billion in  Shell complained to the Energy Department after finding high levels of H2S in a cargo the company bought as part of a 62 millionbarrel purchase from the US government in January according to emails provided by the department in response to the Reuters public records request . Shell said it was 8220unpleasantly surprised to find the high levels and caused concern at Shell about the quality of SPR crude for future purchases . The oil was pumped from Bryan Mound through pipelines to the nearest oil terminal at Freeport Texas before being loaded onto ships according to records reviewed by Reuters and a department official . Shell was not able to determine how often high levels are detected across the industry but industry experts and chemical petroleum engineers said such incidents are rare .

---  The Bush administration8217s refusal to allow UN inspectors to join hunt for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has elicited high interest in foreign news media . The media have raised the possibility that the US might 8220plant in Iraq and that this may be another reason to keep UN inspectors out of the hunt . Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity conducted informal colloquium on the issue . Most believe that Washington would consider it far too risky to send UN inspectors back into Iraq but also served notice that he would not allow them to be led 8220like dogs on a leash8221 by US forces there . The odds of such planting seem less than even speculation on the possibility drove us down memory lane to memory lane. Likely or not in present circumstances there is ample precedent for such covert action operations there is a little known subject to such covert operations in Latin America . There is a reminder that were the Bush administration to decide in favor of a planting or similar operation it would not have to start from scratch as far as experience is concerned as far away from experience as far from the current situation is concerned . The government is replete with examples of fabrication and misrepresentation of US government actions in Vietnam and Vietnam war . The US government and Vietnam are replete  With William Casey at the helm of the CIA during the Reagan presidency the planting of evidence to demonstrate that opponents of governments in Central America were sponsored by the USSR reached new heights_or depths . The Reagan administration successfully used the incident to justify lifting the embargo on US arms to El Salvador that President Carter had imposed after members of the Salvadoran National Guard raped and murdered three US nuns and their lay assistant . The Barry Seal affair was a complicated operation designed to incriminate the Nicaraguan Sandinista government for international drug trafficking . In 1986 Barry Seal a former TWA pilot who had trained Nicaraguan Contra pilots in the early eighties was facing a long sentence after a federal drug conviction in Florida was arrested . He would fly his own plane to Colombia and take delivery of cocaine He would then make an 8220emergency landing8221 in Nicaragua and make it appear that Sandinistas were aiding him in drug trafficking. Seal made it appear . The operation went as planned Seal flew to Nicaragua where he landed at a commercial airfield . He was duly photographed with the boxes of cocaine . The photos were blurred and blurred and the national TV went to national TV . The cameras were delivered to the White House and a triumphant Ronald Reagan . What went national TV was blurred and went national
---  Bernhard Schlink the author of the bestselling 1995 book The Reader says the movie of The Reader which is in theaters now is not a Holocaust film . Schlink says he feels The Reader is not about the murder of six million Jews . He feels it is instead about how his own generation of Germans learned about that Holocaust and discovered that those responsible lived in it . The movie version does not show the crime that is at the center of the book does not . The greatest crime in all history was enabled in the end by millions of misdemeanors . The Reader was inspired by Schlink's own generation dealing with what it meant to grow up as kids of the parent generation who had created the Third Reich . The book to me was a stunning achievement and I enjoyed it immensely What was the inspiration for it. Schlink: I have an enduring fascination with Germany. It all brought the Fifties when I grew up in Heidelberg back so vividly. The book is that a criticism has no application to you had something that you had in your mind or mind or learning in the mind or you had to learn something in a way that you think you grew up as a child of the second generation. It is that you have no application or application to learning in  I found her beauty in the movie a little bit difficult to deal with Schlink . I had a completely different Hanna in my mind when I wrote the book . I think she has in her face and her persona a variety from cruel to frightened from soft to tough from a face that seems to understand nothing to a knowledgeable face . I was very glad that Steven Daldry decided not to show what happened in the church or concentration camps I think if they would have shown it it would have moved the movie in the wrong direction. I think we have to constantly keep working on our institutions and make sure they are OK and that our way of talking to each other is OK Cohen. I don8217m in Berlin at the moment I have been here a number of times I come to Berlin because I appreciate the city the way it used to be but it is very evocative to me because it8217s also a city full of ghosts I keep asking myself how it's a city of ghosts . I don't think something like that is going to happen to us again but I think it was so very thin I don’t think it’s not a movie about the Holocaust. I’m not a film about it. I was happy that Steven

The two countries have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars8217 worth of tariffs in recent days and Chinese officials have said this is not the time for negotiations . Trump administration officials have stressed that the tariffs are not yet in place and the dispute could be resolved through talks . There has been no indication that Trump and Xi have had any conversations since the trade conflict erupted last week and no formal trade talks between the United States and China have been scheduled yet On Tuesday Washington unveiled some 50 billion worth of proposed tariffs on Chinese imports and on Thursday Trump upped the ante directing US trade officials to identify tariffs on another 100 billion of Chinese imports .

---  On January 5 a blogger with the PBS8217 NewsHour asked former CIA analyst Ray McGovern to respond to three questions regarding recent events involving the CIA FBI and the intelligence community in general . McGovern asked former FBI attorneyspecial agent Coleen Rowley a colleague in Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity VIPS to review his responses and add her own comments at the end . The Q ampamp A is below Question 1: What lapses in the American counter terrorism apparatus made the Christmas Day bombing plot possible . The first question as posed deals in a familiar way with symptoms of the core problem but not the core itself and thus tends to obscure the essence of 8220why they hate us8221 . The answer to the second sentence is Yes, it is inevitable that certain plots will succeed The short answer is Yes it is Yes It is inevitable it is yes it is   certain plots will . The long answer would address the question as to how we might best minimize their prospects for success, says McGovern . And to do this sorry to say there is no getting around the necessity to address the necessity of addressing the root causes of terrorism or in the vernacular 8220 why they hate U.S. and why they hated us  President Barack Obama has appointed John Brennan to lead a 8220thorough investigation into how the people under his general aegis screwed up regarding the Abdulmutallab affair . The new Director of National Intelligence position created by the post 911 8220reforms8221 wasis totally unnecessary8212and counterproductive . The most effective thing we need to look back would be to release the CIA report on CIA performance prior to 911 . That report was run and its report was prepared by an honest Inspector General it turns out he retired almost a year ago and has not been replaced . The report was immediately suppressed by one of those named by those named thenActing DC. It was followed by the successors as Director Michael Gossin, Leonetta and Leonetta Panetta now followed by Director Michael Hayden and Director Michael Panetta. The report fixed blame and followed by names named names and names of names of blame and perpetrators of the names of those who have not been properly investigated .

---  On Tuesday July 28 the United States government announced that it had revoked the visas of four leading members of the Honduran coup . The US State Department had responded quickly with harsh statements against the June 28th Honduran military coup but over most of the last month the US government carried out few active measures to pressure the coup plotters to step down . US backed negotiations were criticized for helping to legitimize the coup d8217etat . US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton had appeared to condemn President Zelaya more than the de facto Roberto Micheletti regime . Zelaya told reporters over last weekend that he believed Secretary Clinton was 8220not acting firmly against the repression that Honduras is suffering . The United States has dragged its feet behind Latin America and Europe and refused to pull its ambassador and cut off all aid to Honduras . But Washington had been silent Not one country in the world8212has recognized the de de facto Honduran government that swore itself in the same day it threw Zelaya out of the country last month . The assassination death toll is at least up to nine and hundreds of Hondurans remain in the streets in support of Zelaya and hundreds have been detained hundreds of thousands of people have been arrested and detained . The White House has been putting the pressure  The IAPA is an organization of newspaper tycoons owners publishers and editors who immediately recognized both the 2002 Venezuelan coup and the Honduran coup . Members of the organization have a long history of supporting Latin American dictatorships and US interventions . The organization criticized the censorship and loss of press freedoms and cited 8220complaints from news media and journalists that they are still restricted intimidated and attacked while they attempt to report . The Washington Post quickly echoed the talking points of the coup plotters that Zelaya was ripped from office because he was attempting an unconstitutional referendum to extend his term in office . The excuse for Zelaya8217s removal is a matter of semantics that is rooted in presumptions . The Honduran President was actually planning a nonbinding referendum to ask Honduran people if there should be a fourth ballot to decide whether to hold a new political constitution . The United States knows it would be a non binding referendum to vote for a new constitutional reform . The US Post has painted Zelaya as a Hugo Chavezbacked caudillo attempting to overtake the powers of Honduran government . The U.S. President was not a coup plotter but was actually trying to take control of his own constitutional powers . The American Post knows it knows it knew it
---  For most Americans there is an illusion that our safety comfort and freedoms rest on a foundation so large and protected as to be immune to collapse 8211 at least in our lifetimes . The financialized economy the largely privatized military industrial complex the fossil fuel industry the domestic security apparatus the industrial agriculture industry and more could very well be our demise as a civilization . The population is likely 8211 in both constructive and regressive ways 8211 to lash out at the power elite and at each other as of this moment how is the powerclass likely to respond to such blowback to crises . It is safe to assume for the sake of this discussion that climate change economic insecurity the dangers created by the military such as terroristic blowback and internal conflict within the American population to name a few will to some degree begin to dictate the terms on which ordinary Americans live their lives in the nearfuture . The term 82ecoterrorist extremists continue to conduct acts of politically motivated violence to force segments of society including the general public to change attitudes about issues considered important to their causes . There has been a great deal of speculation 8211 as there should be 8211 about how Trump will handle dissent after 911 but rather it was easier to present that view and act upon it .  Since the 2008 economic crash security agencies have increasingly spied on political activists especially environmental groups on behalf of corporate interests . This activity is linked to the last decade of US defense planning which has been increasingly concerned by the risk of civil unrest at home triggered by catastrophic events linked to climate change energy shocks or economic crisis . The tracking of domestic protest groups and peaceful gatherings raises questions over whether DHS is chilling the exercise of First Amendment rights and over whether the department created in large part to combat terrorism has allowed its mission to creep beyond the bounds of useful security activities as its annual budget has grown beyond 60 billion8221 That article is highly recommended for this topic . Like 911 the financial crash of 2008 can be seen as a marker in the increase of dissent being labelled terrorism and crime as issues involving the environment poverty the military and militarized police and others grew worse in the aftermath of the military the military . There was probably never a time in American history when the domestic population8217s attempt to create security through activism was not considered a threat to the security of centralized power but certain events such as 911 and the 2008 crash have given this attitude more legitimacy both behind the closed doors of the security apparatus and in the public discourse .

Tesco said on Monday it would cut a net 800 jobs and on Tuesday French retailer Carrefour CARRPA announced a voluntary redundancy plan for 2400 staff . The first quarter draws to a close and what a quarter it has been investors have had a lot thrown at them from the biggest ever rise in stock market volatility to rapidly escalating tensions over global trade deepening tumult in the White House and tech sector wobbles . Next week will probably see a drama involving all three and possibly other elements too that we don8217t even know about yet but some experienced analysts suggest that the rout in stocks may not point to panic over a fullscale trade war . The final US government read on fourth quarter will come hot on the heels of the Federal Reserve's first interest rate hike of the fourth quarter should be reassuring The United States is a fairly closed economy and Donald Trump was dishing out that new tax cuts not threatening trade wars .

The U.S. Commerce Department said  Apple CEO Tim Cook called for 8220calm heads8221 and more open trade amid rising fears of a trade war between the U.S. and China . China's Commerce Ministry on Friday urged the United States to 8220pull back from the brink8221 saying it was not afraid to engage in trade war . The deepening rift has sent a chill through financial markets and the corporate world as investors predicted dire consequences for the global economy should trade barriers start going up . The sparring has cast a spotlight on hardware makers such as Apple which assemble the majority of their products in China for export to other countries . Apple and other foreign tech firms have grappled with a string of new regulatory requirements in China including a controversial law requiring firms to house user data in data centers overseen by Chinese firms . Last month Apple officially moved to store keys for its iCloud data in China provoking intense criticism from rights groups who say the decision makes it easier for Chinese officials to tap and collect private data . Despite challenges the company has sought to expand its services in China its thirdlargest market where roughly 18 million developers use its platform . Cook also attended last year when he called for China to increase trade and continue opening itself up to the world its third largest market where about 18 million

Spencer's work is a trending topic again this time for outraging the opposite side of the aisle . The AntMan and Morning Glories writer attracted the ire of Fox and Friends for daring to pit Cap against a group of borderpatrolling white supremacists a move the show felt was an open insult 8220against conservatives . The Daily Beast talked to Spencer about why he had Steve break bad and how the twist will reconcile with the character8217s legacy and that of its Jewish creators and his response to fans8217 outrage . Spencer says outrage is exactly what he wanted and that this is the kind of story designed to upset people and shock people and worry people . This has real lasting repercussions that are gonna be with us for a while says Spencer this one will not be undone within the span of one story arc or even in the next few months or in the short story arc of the story arc . He says he couldn8217t have predicted the magnitude of the response or the SayNoToToHyDRACap hashtag would be more than he expected but in terms of the magnitude and just how many people are  Rick Remender was the previous writer on the book and when I took over he had had some plotlines that were outstanding . One of them was that Hydra had infiltrated all the various teams and organizations in the Marvel universe and we were gonna be weeding out the various Hydra clans .

Steve was by far the person who could do the most damage He's the leader of the Avengers he has a relationship with the US government and he works closely with SHIELD . The resurgent Hydra that Red Skull is pulling together seems to share a lot of parallels with America Great Again Again Again, Trumps Trumps America Great. fight for it and for there to be pushback and there was very little We had a luxury though I could lay out the whole story for them. I think I can say with confidence is that with this story our intention and our hope is that in its own unique way it reinforces what everybody already knows about Captain America which is his power as a symbol and what that means We are approaching it from a different angle
---  In an inversion of journalistic ethics the Sacramento Bee reported on opposition to an event before and after it took place but didn8217t cover the event itself . The event in question was part of a national speaking tour that featured an Auschwitz survivor speaking about Israel8217s treatment of Palestinians . The talk was immediately opposed by the Jewish AntiDefamation League ADL and the 13member Board of Rabbis of Greater Sacramento who demanded that the center refuse to allow the event to take place . Despite the attempt to prevent it however the event went forward as planned drawing approximately 500 people . The Bee despite choosing to cover prior complaints against it chose not to cover it and instead printed claims by powerful local figures that the flier was 8220an outrageous lie8221 but refused to print information showing that the statements were factual The Bee's headline about the allegedly offensive flier emphasized a largely nonexistent Muslim connection in its headline emphasized a Muslim connection . The headline also appeared on newspaper websites in Florida Texas, Idaho Mississippi Alaska and elsewhere generating antiMuslim comments . It neglected to report that one of those attacking flier had previously attempted to use his official position to try to prevent the event from taking place before the Bee didn't mention this Steinberg had previously tried to stop it  The Bee and McClatchy chose to emphasize the venue of the event in their headline 8220Flier at California Muslim center condemned by state senator . Despite the fact that the center had nothing to do with the flier a headline and news story were sent around the country that served to reinforce the Islamophobic fiction that Muslims are inherently antiSemitic . In point of fact however however the statements are accurate and accurate . There is detailed evidence that some Zionists collaborated with the Nazis that Zionists sabotaged antiNazi boycotts . In 1933 Zionist leaders concluded a secret pact with the Third Reich that transferred 60000 Jews and 100000 to Palestine in return that they would halt the worldwide boycott of the Hitler regime in its first year . In 2002 Israeli newspaper Ha HaGurion wrote that the Israeli government was worried about the treatment of Palestinians in Germany and that Palestinians in pre-war Germany and saw this as a threat warning that Israel was worried in the pre-occupation as a warning warning that the Jewish treatment of Jews in Germany . Yet in 2002 the newspaper HaZionism is in danger in the form of anti-Zionistism is “in danger’s ‘the treatment of the Holocaust” and that the ‘Jewish

---  Jorge Eliecer Gaitan was shot to death by an apparently deranged individual on the eve of the meeting that created the Organization of American States OAS . The assassination sparked a civil war that some say continues to this day . No one knows the motivation of his killer who was killed with bare hands stripped him naked except for his necktie and dragged him across the capital city of Bogota to deposit his body on the steps of the presidential palace . Theories of the assassination are based on the motives of the killer who may have been Juan Roa Roa or the suspected killer on the grounds of the Sierra Roa who was himself killed immediately after his death . The event is counted as one of the most if not the most tragic event in Colombia's most tragic events in Colombia history in Colombia and is considered the most emblematic of the Colombian conflict . It occurred at a moment of the very dramatic assassination at a very dramatic moment and sent waves of shock throughout the country and created waves of a spontaneous civil war . It is believed to have sent thousands of thousands of people into the country into rioting and the death of the assassin who killed at least 3000 people in the city killing at least 3,000 people and sparking a new word .  Many Colombians believe that the United States orchestrated the murder of Jorge Eliecer Gaitan . The death was cynically used by the US government to rally the delegates to the Pan American Conference into an anticommunist bloc . The CIA is believed to be capable of programming Manchurian Candidates and manipulating world events at the microscopic level . There is no evidence whatsoever that Juan Roa Sierra was related to the Colombian revolutionary war hero . Roa was obsessed with witchcraft and the occult and believed himself to be the reincarnation of General Francisco de Paula Santander . The first director of the CIA told an untrue story to Congress when asked who was responsible for the murder in the firstever investigation of a CIA 8220intelligence failure failure8221 Yet there is really no evidence of US involvement in the murder . The theory that the CIA was behind the murder is based on the belief that Gaitans was planning a military coup for May and only his death in the midst of the international meeting that could prevent it could prevent the international coup for the international conference of May and the death of the military . There are no evidence that the assassination of Fidel Castro was involved in the assassination. The CIA has also adherents to the theory that Laureano Gomez

Obama is calling on Congress to pass a stimulus package that will cost 700 to 800 billion or more over two years .

A number of powerful Republican senators are also opposing the stimulus package but their opposition wreaks of hypocrisy .

At the same time consumers are saving money for the first time since the 1950s  A PDF released this week by economists Lawrence Mishel and Heidi Shierholz lays out what the economy is in store if action is not taken quickly . The authors recommend government spending on the order of 600 billion per year for the next two years to head off the otherwise inevitable catastrophe . Without timely and adequate government intervention unemployment after peaking at about 102 in mid2010 could still be as high as 76 four years from now . Unemployment would reach a record high of 51 among the collegeeducated 12 points above the previous high of 39 in the depths of the 1980s recession .

---  Wisconsin Democrats took five out of the summer8217s nine recalls and also won the overall vote count by 507 to 493 . Democrats failed however in their chief goal winning enough seats to wrest control of the State Senate majority and so shift the balance of power away from Governor Scott Walker and his allies in the legislature . Wisconsin Democrats also failed to win enough seats in the state senate to block Governor Walker's hardline agenda . Wisconsin's historic summer of recalls ended on August 16th when a pair of Democratic state senators easily defended their seats from a Republican recall effort . Wisconsin Republicans meanwhile cast the results as a vindication of Walker's Republican game plan and the people decided that they were pretty happy with the direction the Republicans are moving the state and let them retain power in Madison . Can it be both If not then who really won in Wisconsin? And what does that portend for the fledgling movement sparked by the labor uprising in February and March?

Leftleaning groups almost entirely disclosed their funders in recall efforts . Democrats failed to hammer home their message to other states that politicians who challenge union power will pay a price .

Thompson: There are plenty of reasons why a recall Walker Walker would be a long shot of a recall . There are only two reasons why be a short-term shot for a long-term starter . For the long-standing reasons why would be long- starters for a recall of Governor Walker. For the short-lived Governor Walker, there are no obvious winners in the recalls it's not long-lasting and there are reasons why it's a long way to go back to the right to worry about what comes next for progressives of all recall .

The US military put countering China and Russia at the center of a new national defense strategy unveiled on Friday . The Pentagon did not directly comment on the latest patrol but said such operations are routine . The Philippines has sparred with China for decades over what it says is aggressive conduct at the Scarborough Shallow Shoal but has found an unlikely new ally who prefers to avoid confrontation with the U.S. But in 2016 an international tribunal in 2016 ruled that no one country has sole rights to exploit the shoal is a traditional fishing ground no one has sole right to exploit .

In The Case Against Israel Ari Paul attempts to build the moral case that Israel and the Zionist movement were always in the wrong because their presence has always been illegitimate .

Yet what is not stated is that ultrareligious Jews such as Satmars oppose Zionism because they only believe in Jewish state when a biblical prophecy is fulfilled . For Neumann to ignore this in order to make this order fit his order fit this would not know this would disqualify many of his assertions about Israeli history is the major flaw in his vision of Israeli history . For example he seems to hold all divisions in the vision of Zionism, while recognizing divisions including laborists and those in binationalism . For him to hold this way he discusses  Israeli society and progressives should work to resist that But Israel8217s political scene is like a jigsaw puzzle of ideologies from the left to the right In Israel many authors have noted Jewish fundamentalists are often to subject of scorn by the general secular population .

---  Is the Obama administration correct when it claims its contraception mandate will be 8220cost neutral8221 for insurance companies? Or are the critics right when they say Catholic institutions will pay a hidden cost in the form of higher premiums when their insurers are required to give birth control to their female employees . We8217ve found plenty of evidence But it8217s often conflicting 8212 and ultimately inconclusive . Until better data are available we8217re unable to conclude whether the Obama birthcontrol mandate is likely to result in a net cost increase or not . This is the first story prompted by our Spin Detectors feature through which we ask our readers to help us monitor political claims and campaigns across the country . We ask our . readers to . help usMonitor political claims across the . country Our thanks to Hugh Haines of Sacramento Calif who sent us a press release by Republican Rep Dan Lungren of California for sending us a copy of his press release to a press press release with a copy copy of the . article which follows the analysis section of the Analysis section which includes the . Analysis section of this article . We are happy to provide a look at the latest in which we have found some of the most compelling examples of political claims in the past .  A 1998 study found that an insurance company adding 8220the full range of reversible medical contraceptives8221 would increase costs by 2140 per employee per year . Most of the money 1712 would be covered by employers while employees would pay 428 a year . Proponents of the contraception mandate have argued those costs are minimal compared with longterm savings . But the costs and savings of contraception mandates aren8217t so clear cut in some state studies . In 2001 Janice Lachance then director of the US Office of Personnel Management explained in a letter to the National Women8217s Law Center that premiums were not affected after the federal government added contraception to the health coverage of 9 million employees retirees and their family members . Some plans also recorded a decrease in maternityrelated costs following the mandate . But some plans reported that the number of pregnancies increased following the . mandate . Connecticut study said its birthcontrol mandate would lead to an increase in premiums that year by as much as 1728 per person but the study could not conclude whether private insurance plans saved enough money from reduced pregnancy costs to offset the added expenses of contraception coverage . University of Connecticut study found the mandate has had little effect on contraception coverage in the first year of the mandate. Connecticut study concluded that the mandate
---  Workingclass voters whose lives have been materially worsened by conservative policies they have supported is a less comfortable fact one we have trouble talking about in a straightforward manner . Thomas Frank chose to observe the phenomenon by going back to his home state of Kansas a place particularly illserved by the conservative policies of privatization deregulation and deunionization . Kansas is today the site of a ferocious struggle within the Republican Party a fight pitting affluent moderate Republicans against conservatives from the workingclass districts and the downmarket churches . Liberalism may not be the monstrous allpowerful conspiracy that conservatives make it out to be but its failings are clear nonetheless . This is due partially I think to the Democratic Party8217s moreorless official response to its waning fortunes . The Democratic Leadership Council DLC has long been pushing the party to forget bluecollar voters and concentrate instead on recruiting affluent whitecollar professionals who are liberal on social issues . The larger interests that the DLC wants desperately to court are corporations capable of generating campaign contributions far outweighing anything raised by organized labor . The way to collect the votes and 8212 the money of these coveted constituencies is to stand rocksolid on say the prochoice position while making endless concessions on economic issues on welfare . Democrats will always be marginally better onEconomic issues than Republicans  The true lesson for liberals in the Kansas story is the utter and final repudiation of their historical decision to remake themselves as the other probusiness party . By dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from Republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the sneers of Hollywood . Democrats no longer speak to the people on the losing end of a freemarket system that is becoming more brutal and more arrogant by the day . Liberalism isn8217t a force of karmic nature that pushes back when the corporate world goes too far it is a manmade contrivance as subject to setbacks and defeats as any other . Union voters are in other words the reverse image of the Brownback conservative who cares nothing for economics but torments himself night and day with vague fears about 8220cultural decline, the Kochs. building on the right, says Julian Zelizer . The Kochs Foundation is a phenomenon that has little one operated by the leftwing counterpart to the left anymore anymore than its counterpart, Zelizer writes . Zelizer says. The right understands the central significance of movementbuilding and they have taken to task with the vast and complex complex complex with admirable diligence with their personal diligence Cast your eyes over the
---  The C130 Hercules is a midsized transport airplane designed to airlift people or cargo around a theater of operations It dates back to the Korean War when the Air Force decided that it needed a next generation 8220NextGen8221 transport plane . Lockheed bypassed the Pentagon and went straight to Congress using a procedure known as a congressional 8220addon82218212that is an earmark8212 Lockheed was able to sell the military another fleet of C130s that it didn't want to sell . The company squeezed Uncle Sam for a bailout of around 1 billion in loan guarantees and other relief which was unusual back then . Lockheed has reported 22289859 in political donations since 1990 and has reported more than two million in lobbying expenses every year peaking in 2008 according to the Center for Responsive Politics . The Herk can land on short runways even ones made of dirt or grass even if it doesn't include what it paid its PR teams or the work of defense and aerospace industry or the think tanks it funded . Lockheed's lobbying and political donations is hard to do to give sense of the scope of the numbers but it doesn’t include what the company paid for lobbying but it gives sense of a sense of common sense . Lockheed  Pentagon acquired 50 planes for every one requested request for C130s . Air Force didn't have the space for them so they retired some older models that still had plenty of life in them and shunted most of the rest off to the Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard . Lockheed was so successful on Capitol Hill that its work even garnered a name in honor of the 50 planes bought for each one requested . C130 politics was a twist on the old militaryindustrial complex, says Pentagon official Walter Pincus . The result the military was often prevented from retiring the oldest Herks the ones that really needed to be put out to pasture . The NotSoSuper Hercules or the Program That Just Won8217t Die Air Force attempts to replace the C130 with a new generation of transport planes also have a habit of dying or getting rerouted The Herk8217s turf has generally proved remarkably sacrosanct but not always in tune but not in tune in the tune but Lockheed calls it not always but not but in tune with the tune in tune . The C130J Super Hercules has been plagued by problems in recent years . The program that just Won is being cancelled too though a new congressional C130 Modernization Caucus spawned by Boeing
---  Each course of action being generally discussed in the media today will be insufficient will be too little too late especially because the law is not designed to handle a disaster of this magnitude . The Security Investors Protection Act commonly referred to as SIPC pronounced Sipic is not yet completely clear how it intends to handle this question . The law will not cover persons who invested through a fund rather than directly with Madoff . The Trustee in Bankruptcy who has taken over Madoff8217s business and estate is seeking hidden monies and will divide proceeds among the investors . Finally clawbacks will not apply to people who took out money after learning of facts that reasonably should have put them on notice that something was wrong and it would apply I assume though I haven8217t read anything explicit on this only to money they took out after being put on such notice . But people remain terrified of the possibility and as the media has said many who innocently took out monies are considering not making claims to the SEC but leaving their money in to be stolen by Madoff hardly seems what a capitalist system expects from people is expected to expect from people who had no inkling that anything was wrong is unknown . Tax refunds are tax refunds of the last three years of Madoff income  There should be a special law allowing Madoff victims who paid taxes on phantom income to the government 8212 taxes which would not have been paid but for governmental dereliction 8212 to recover all the taxes they paid . The exact amount of the deduction that can be taken is a matter of great dispute involving complex tax ideas that are incomprehensible to laymen and even to attorneys who are not tax lawyers . Refunds of income tax will not however help all investors . Charity and pension plans that were crippled or wiped out are nonprofit taxfree organizations so they never paid income tax and will get no refunds of tax . The theft loss deduction is also of no use to the charities or pension plans which got crippled or . wiped out . The SEC acted in gross violation of public policy that the agency has been obligated to uphold since it was created in I think 1933 It is obligated it has a duty to all citizens to prevent fraud upon them It has no discretion none to thwart in such manner the basic purpose of the statute the basic policy the basic goal of the SEC and the SEC8217 income 2005 2006 and 2007 and can be carried forward for 20 years But there are huge problems with the theft . The IRS may fight to keep the theft deduction as low as possible
---  Occupy Oakland circulates in a bynow familiar pattern forced from the camp at the break of day . Occupy Oakland is under attack and that even my title is wholly insufficient this war is not 8220coming8221 this war has already begun Breaching the Limits of Tolerance . The repression that comes is not a distinct and corrupted form of tolerance as for Marcuse but instead embedded within the idea itself This lesson is of paramount importance to the Occupy Movement but so is its opposite even the most repressive of tolerance has its limits in the pushandpull of forces vying for control and must be countered with the optimism of transgressing those limits This war began as most do in the realm of hegemonic struggle where small shifts signal coming offensives But walking the fine line of counterintelligence and counterinsurgency the forces conspiring against Occupy Movement have been anything but subtle In a crude and thinlyveiled information war lies are tossed about like the Occupy movement . The guardians of good order to step in to defend the common good are nothing but the Occupy movements are nothing less than the oppressors . Occupy is unsanitary now dangerously so now downright violent and unacceptable to the Middle America for which it claims to speak . Occupy movements need to turn the language of counter  A small few broke windows at a bank and assailed Whole Foods in my old neighborhood . Powerful day was sullied by the actions of a small few who broke windows in a bank . City Council was almost unanimously urging its removal and the formerly remorseful Jean Quan was once again urging the Occupiers to vacate . The very same Mayor who had approved the devastatingly brutal raid a week prior finally signed on to allow the same police to move in and clear the camp . The Radical Caucus of Occupy Philly had brought forth a proposal to the General Assembly which simply stated that the Occupy camp would not voluntarily leave in preparation for a scheduled construction project in Dilworth Plaza and would resist eviction . The proposal seemed to shock many who had been lulled into the false sense of security that liberal tolerance provides . Nutter highlighted a sexual assault at the camp as an indication of just how far the movement had fallen . Occupy Philly itself was quick to respond at a counterpress conference yesterday speaker after speaker . The Occupiers massed at the Public Library only to march once again up 14th Street to again seize Oscar Grant Plaza with no resistance from police . The same Plaza the Mayor had just spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of dollars to clear it is clear that she has
---  Obama said that we all have to vote and speak out and pledged never to shut up . He said that a year from now when I no longer hold this office I8217ll be right there with you as a citizen . Obama concluded by saying the state of the union is strong and ended with the foolish platitude Please God let this be Barack Obama8217s last . There are only so many airsickness bags left in America . Obama then moved on national security and told his biggest lie of the evening . He then said that he wanted to shut down Gitmo Again of course . And again pushing the lie that Gitmo is 8220unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies .

Obama trotted out the 8220ISIS is not Islamic8221 routine because he suffers from a grave probably incurable case of Radical Islam Denial Syndrome . ISIS doesn8217t threaten our national existence but ostrichlike leftism surely does . Obama set up the false dichotomy between building every country that falls into crisis8221 and the beauties of diplomacy . As a triumph of this strategy he cited Syria Seriously And championed the Iran deal . He went on to talk about how well he8217s done with the TPP and how he thinks a private sector is the lifeblood of the economy8221 He said the American people 8220have a choice to make8221 But after years of record corporate profits corporate families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules of everyone else or working . Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis . This is working families aren't getting more opportunity . Wall Street is falling behind because Obama insists on quashing investments that would create jobs . He actually thinks that the private sector in the economy is a nasty place full of greedy humans who must be curbed by the great god of government . He said that he thinks that he thought that the
---  Almost oneandahalf million websites have something to say about the subject . TSA had better get smart if the U.S. is to avoid another major terrorist attack on its air transportation system without placing greater restrictions on the civil liberties of air travelers . A reasonable and practical balance in airport security screening policy must be obtained before another terrorist attack results in even greater repression . TSA transformed contract screening guards into quasilaw enforcement officers and provided uniform training and policies however the TSA was organized as a topdown directed organization which allows very little discretion to individual officers . TSA has identified three basic ways to achieve mission effectiveness baggage inspection passenger screening and most recently behavior observation . As presently constituted the employment process perpetuates mediocrity and limits the ability of TSA managers to hire and promote the most qualified officers . Currently TSA job applicants primarily use the Internet to identify job announcements for TSA airport operations at more than 450 airports complete applications and take an online test to measure their ability to operate screening equipment . The main problem is that once applicants meet these minimum requirements and pass a physical examination drug screening and drug screening they are lumped together with all other applicants in a hiring pool for each job site . There are no ranked lists of most qualified applicants within these pools there are no rankings of  The essential question is whether TSA officers are security guards or police officers when it comes to the manner and extent to which they make decisions . TSA must rethink the manner in which its officers are hired and trained to allow greater discretion without an unacceptable rise in the risk of a terrorist attack . The current recession and high unemployment rate has resulted in a gigantic pool of highlyqualified and welleducated people who are looking for work . Avis says TSA could build an elite organization if local managers were simply allowed to rank the hiring pools by qualifications rather than having to hire the candidate who filed the earliest application . The key to successful screening is a workforce capable of implementing a riskbased screening process based upon updated software and equipment and ready access to an improved data base . The TSA has been moving in this direction with its steps have been hesitant and unsure as it has staggered from incident to increasingly negative incidents . A former highlevel TSA manager who believes the key to success requires more intensive training and intensive development and intensive training . TSA can start all over again from scratch from scratch but surely there is a way to maintain the basic approach to maintaining the basic security guard approach from scratch again but surely is a safe approach but there is no scientific validation of the program but there are a way

---  Manhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald was shouted down by protesters at UCLA then silenced and forced to escape with a police escort the next day during what should have been her talk at Claremont McKenna College . These incidents follow the February riot that forced the cancellation of a Milo Yiannopoulos talk at UC Berkeley and the March shoutdown at Middlebury College of conservative Charles Murray followed by the violent attack that sent Murray8217s liberal interlocutor Professor Allison Stanger to the hospital . The crisis of free speech has also been aggravated by a rising tide of shoutdowns and disruptions of proIsrael speakers since 2014 . The campus disruptions of the 1960s and early 1970s set the pattern for all that was to follow from the mid 1980s onward Most important for our purposes Yale8217's Woodward Report of 1974 the classic defense of campus free speech identified a series of shoutdown and disinvitations stretching eleven years as that Yale would need to break What the Woodward Report began in 1963 when President Kingman Brewinman 8220 failed when Kinginman was back in 1963 and when the pattern began when Kingman Kingman 82failed to back into law and order in 1963 . Yet the pattern of Yale would begin in 1963 with the pattern when President Brewster 8220 .  The key to solving the campus freespeech crisis lies in the decadelong interregnum between the radical Sixties and the kickoff of the campus culture wars in the mid 1980s . A great many of the Sixties radicals rejected classicalliberal conceptions of freedom in favor of a neoMarxist analysis . In this view free speech and constitutional democracy are tools used by the ruling class to suppress dissent and protect an oppressive society . In the 1980s the radicals left graduate school and took up junior faculty positions bringing suspicions of free speech with them . The younger and more radical generation of faculty members reached critical mass that had the numbers to control hiring . By the 2000s the tenured radicals constituted a controlling majority in many social science and humanities departments and stood as the most powerful plurality in the university as a whole . The fourth anti8211freespeech wave 8220Transformed Generation8221 consists of the late Millennial students who began demanding safespaces and trigger warnings around 2014 around 2014 .

US efforts to create a new Iraqi army muchtouted and funded to the tune of 25 billion over the 10 years of the American occupation had failed miserably .

Polar bear populations are likely to fall by more than 30 percent by around midcentury as global warming shrinks their habitat amid thawing Arctic sea ice . The missing polar bear serves as a poignant reminder of what we stand to lose unless we take action on climate . The Dutch government said on Thursday it will phase out gas production at the Groningen field once Europe8217's largest by 2030 as part of efforts to reduce the danger caused by small but damaging earthquakes . The Netherlands is building a conversion plant to make highcalorific foreign gas suitable for use in Dutch systems of energy by 2022 In addition the Netherlands is also building a convert plant to convert foreign gas to use in its own systems .

Smallholders struggle to make large profits because they do not use the latest farming methods and cannot buy the best fertilisers and pesticides cheaply and their yields are usually lower than the industry average . Growing oil palm promised big profits 25 years ago but has turned out to be a 8220false dream8221 for many smallholders who live in poverty and have only a basic education level industry officials said . The challenge for international companies now faced with a scarcity of land to expand and the need to secure future supplies is to work with small growers like farmers like Kasno even though many farmers find it hard to follow sustainability rules . Smallholder farmers are often unable to follow the sustainability rules and cannot access credit or insurance that would help them when extreme weather damages their crops . The aim is to train smallholders to adopt modern farming techniques as well as ensure they avoid planting on peatland or burning during land clearance during palm oil clearance or deforestation during land clearing or clearing land . The project was partly funded by UN Environment and is backed by major European buyers of palm oil

The commonly prescribed SSRIs in the US include Prozac by Eli Lilly Paxil by GlaxoSmithKline Zoloft by Pfizer and Celexa and Lexapro by Forest Labs along with various generic versions of the drugs . Many of the world8217s leading experts on psychiatric drugs traveled to Washington to appear at the hearing to testify about the need to extend the back box warnings to all age groups . The limited warning is widely viewed as another gift to drug makers by the FDA by the pharmaceutical industry . The industry has created a revolving door where top officials move directly from their government employment into highpaying positions with drug companies The latest evidence of this charge appeared in the media on May 4 2007 with a press release by Prozacmaker Eli Lilly announcing that Alex Azar II will be joining Lilly as senior vice president who was the Deputy Secretary of the federal Health and Human  Dr Timothy Scott author of 8220 America Fooled The Truth about Antidepressants Antipsychotics and How We8217ve Been Deceived8221 8220 . Dr Scott says SSRI makers have enjoyed enormous financial benefits from their manipulations of the clinical trial data and the FDA continues to ignore all evidence aside from data provided by the drug companies . Attorney Menzies calls the FDA8217s statement that 8220scientific data does not show an increased risk in adults older than 24 and that adults ages 65 and older taking antidepressants have a decreased risk of suicidality . The pharmacological effects of antidepressants are clinically negligible8221 The Emperor 8217s New Drugs An Analysis of Antidepressant Medication Data Submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration by Irving Kirsch .

Two Equal Employment Opportunity Commision complaints against him 8212 one by former administrative assistant Sylvia Lopez and another by former assistant coach JB Gerald 8212 overshadowed a disappointing 111 record in 2009 . The latest legal issue plus the preseason media poll picking the Lobos to finish last in the conference this season has given the team a precarious start to 2010 . The Journal caught up with the 40-year-old Lockley during the MWC Media Days and the coach was ready to look ahead and talk football . UNM is on probation and has a class of 20 recruits this season 8212 which includes four players who won't be eligible until 2011 that leaves you 16 players to help a 2009 team that went 111 . The Mountain West Conference media poll picked the Lobo to finished last in last season this season . The Lobos were picked last by the preseason MWC media poll in last year's media poll . The team was picked last year with three years of eligibility left it's a sprint not going to be a marathon not to be going out this time .  Mike Locksley says he has had a quieter summer and spring than last season . He says the team was able to focus through the adversity we faced last year but this is definitely how I envisioned year one to be . The administration has made a commitment to enhancing the studentathlete experience and it show me that if they are willing to do it for basketball they8217ll do it as football as it presents itself to us . The quarterback battle in fall camp is going to be an open competiton when you want that position settled and have one guy emerge .

---  Critics have often blamed Iran's President Rouhani of Iran for blindly following the neoclassicalneoliberal model of capitalism . Critics say Rouhani's economic policies are following the worst aspects of that model . The bankingfinancial sector is given a free rein to engage in all kinds of parasitic speculative activities . This practice has robbed the manufacturing sector of the economy of the productivelyinvestible finance capital it has thereby led to a severe economic stagnation and high rates of unemployment . The 2008 financial crisis in the US was precipitated largely by a disproportionately high degree of financialization that is by an unsustainable financial bubble on top of a much narrower base of real values . Unimpeded importation of foreign products into Iran8217s opendoor market into Iran's economy has greatly contributed to Iran's economic stagnation . The persistent economic stagnation in Iran is largely due to a dire lack of an effective macroeconomic policy. Lack of economic policy is in turn mostly due to President Rouhani and his economic team seem to be partly due to the financialization disaster in the U.S. and other core capitalist countries around the world . Iran is among the highest in the world that that that parasitic growth that is called moasesaateaatariari is certainly the most parasitic growth  The ability of the banking system to create credit or debt money is determined or limited by two factors: savingsdeposits and central bank policy that determine reserve requirements and the money supply . Commercial banks should always keep a legallydetermined fraction of their deposits for example 20 on hand either in their own coffers or in their accounts with the central bank . This fraction of bank deposits is called required reserves or capital requirement . Only the rest 80 in our example which is called excess reserves can be loaned out . Money creation is logically a sovereign prerogative or national right it belongs to the public not private domain . This requires replacing the present fractional reserve banking system with the 100 reserve system of the present system . William Hixson argues that when 20people make deposits they would actually have legal money in the bank8221 have actually have the legal tender in the Bank of the bank 820 have legal tender . The plan would replace the 100 Reserve System of the Bank8221 . The 100 Reserve system would actually replace the Bank 821-a-bank 822-Bank 8220-Bank 922-bank 8220. not real money in practice it functions just as real money . Money is worn out of interest and interest and debt free and debt
---  Many have focused on President Donald Trump8217s statements on Charlottesville condemning the 8220violence8221 from 8220both sides . But virtually no one has scrutinized the first half of his remarks . How is it that Trump is designated to be in a position of judging the perpetrators of violence? The US government is regularly bombing a number of countries and the threats and use of violence are not new nor is the hypocrisy . Such outbreaks of domestic political violence are used not as openings for introspection about longstanding violence in US society but for rallying cries to uphold alleged virtues of the nation . The system requires a great deal of tension to keep people in their partisan boxes . The Democratic Party has to offer something more than Russiashing to be opposition to the party of Jefferson, the party on the losing side of Many were a war that seems to be a war against the Democrats were a winning side of many at Trump’s . The most of the current political class that condemns the most of this political class. But it is not a conclusion that it could reach a threshold that tears at national unity. The most important thing that each political faction has going for it is the hatred toward the other But there is the threat that the threat to a war .  Trump8217s statements understated as they were about current US government violence were roundly condemned by most of the political class . The establishment media effectively keep the microphone away from anyone else who would note such defining facts while giving reams of coverage to Trump He effectively becomes the leading 8220dissident8221 while also being the head inquisitor . This discourse effectively immunizes the establishment from meaningful change or even dialogue . TaNehisi Coates of the once somewhat somewhatdignified journal The Atlantic said the Civil War was the most lethal war in American history . Coates also claimed 8220The Civil War amount to more than all other American wars combined More people died in that war than World War II World War I Vietnam etc. etc. The Atlantic Coates stated 8220.

Apple acknowledged last month that iPhone software had the effect of slowing down some phones with battery problems but denied that it had ever done anything to intentionally shorten the life of a product . A US prosecutor on Friday attacked a claim by President Donald Trump's longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen that many of the materials seized this week in FBI raids should remain private . Cohen's lawyers asked US District Judge Kimba Wood at the hearing to let them review the seized materials to ensure that there was no violation of attorneyclient privilege which permits clients to shield communications with their lawyers . The judge also heard from a new lawyer for Trump Joanna Hendon who said the president had 8220an acute interest in the case .

---  In Election 20128217s theatreoftheabsurd 8220foreign policy8221 debate Iran came up no less than 47 times in campaign season . Obama inherited a seemingly impregnable threedecadelong 8220Wall of Mistrust8221 in IranUS relations . Washington establishment in Washington loathes even the possibility of bilateral negotiations with Iran . Obama 20 has proposed a sound path which means that it has no credible hope of being adopted by Washington . But Washington does not start thinking beyond its thinking beyond the thinking beyond that of private private discussions in private Washington . Washington has a set of Washington misconceptions as old as that wall and by a bipartisan consensus for an aggressive strategy toward Iran that emerged in the George W Bush years when Congress ponied up 400 million for a series of operations to destabilize that country including crossborder operations by special forces teams including cyberwar and cross-border operations . The time to solve the complex Iranian nuclear drama is now to be in place to solve it is now in place in the place of a sound and that Washington has no hope of adopting a new path to be adopted by the Obama administration, says TomDispatch website . TomDispatch editor Gary Sick Sick, a former White House adviser on the Iranian crisis of 1979  Iran is the ultimate crossroads of Eurasia and so the pivot of the world Strategically it straddles the supply lines for a sizeable part of the globe . Strategically Iran is a privileged hub for the distribution of energy to South Asia Europe and East Asia at a moment when both China and India are emerging as potential great powers of the twentyfirst century . Iran's position at the ultimate Southwest Asian strategic crossroads will determine much about the future New Great Game in Eurasia . Washington doesn't need regime change in Tehran to improve its relationship with Iran to improve relations with that country amp160. It will also involve movements to prop up Beijing in relation to the dollar and at the same time accelerate the death of the petrodollar . The question of who will dominate Eurasia lies the question of what might be called a southern roads and a new Silk Road that might be a major network of major ports and major roads and railways and ports and a major railway network of railways and major cities . Iran and Afghanistan might be pushed for the creation of a southern Silk Road, says Djavad SalehiEsfahani . In other words Iran is an impressive military presence in Afghanistan and Afghanistan. It might be pushing for what might really be called N
---  In late June Stevie Wonder flew to Morocco to perform at a diplomatic conference for the World Intellectual Property Organization Conference delegates were signing a treaty granting small exceptions to international copyright protections . For months organizations like the Intellectual Property Owners Association had urged American trade representatives to reject the treaty . The reference to 8220balance8221 here demonstrates that while piracy may occasionally be radical see Gavin Mueller8217s 8220Gimme the Loot8221 from Jacobin 78 copyright as a system is largely reactionary . This reactionary position can be traced back to John Locke whose ideas about labor property and inequality serve as the uncited moral inspiration for many of today's maximalist copyright advocates . Lawrence Lessig in Free Culture says the statute was written to curb the power of 8220monopolists of the worst kind . In this light the Statute of Anne almost seems reasonable . But the bulk of the repression had already taken place before it was enacted . The bulk of this repression had taken place in 1710 with the majority of the repressive position had already been taken by the English Parliament in 1715 . In the end private property and intellectual property are born of the same womb . In fact the history of copyright here makes a certain amount of sense especially if your goal  Locke was an ardent supporter of eliminating the licensing act because he was appalled by the expensive and badly printed books legally published in England . Hill maintains that after the resistance had been thoroughly crushed and the spirit of capitalism infused in the culture 8220the Licensing Act could be allowed to lapse in 169582398212 not on the radicals8217 libertarian principles but because censorship was no longer necessary . Locke8217s unique justification for the capitalistdemocratic state at once radical and reactionary was founded on a version of the labor theory of value Property rights were 8220natural rights8221 preceding any political arrangement These rights were justified by the fact that people used their labor to improve the property they were taking out of the common treasury . Locke contended that large landowners were still justified because they sold the increased yield and were able to store it in gold which never spoils . The current discourse defends copyright as if it were the vital protection of the creative endeavor itself rather than a bulwark of primitive accumulation in an age of cognitive capitalism . The Obama administration as it has been on all that preceded it. The administration has become even more vigilant and vigilant in the defense of copyright waivers to an extension of intellectual property waivers to less developed countries . The White House has become more vigilant

The US government has grudginglyly and has been accused of meddling  California and other states vowed on Tuesday to stop the US government from asking in the 2020 census whether people are citizens arguing the question could stop immigrants from participating and skew the makeup of Congress . The US Census Bureau decided to include the citizenship question in the onceadecade questionnaire saying an accurate count of citizens would help protect minority rights under the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 . Critics said the move was designed to undercount immigrants potentially reducing their representation in Congress and federal funding for local jurisdictions which is determined by population . The move was conceived by John Gore a political appointee who as a lawyer in private practice defended multiple Republican redistricting plans according to emails obtained by ProPublica . The State of California filed a lawsuit early Tuesday in federal court against the Commerce Department and the Census Bureau .

---  Nick Kurtz is one of thousands of teenagers in this country who have abandoned football likely because of concussions . YAFL the most popular form of youth football in the metro area has also seen its ranks go down . Participation levels shot up from 2009 to 2010 1527 then fell by nearly 80 players then rose again by nearly 90 athletes . At Rio Rancho High one of the biggest schools in New Mexico the football program generally has had more players than almost anywhere else in the state . Participation numbers from Albuquerque Public Schools for that same five years period 200913 and APS8217 information does not reflect the same reduction as that seen in the statewide numbers supplied by the NMAA . The number of football players at New Mexico high schools for the 2013 season was 7323 8211 a 77 percent dropoff from 2009 when the NMNA reported 7888 athletes involved in football However the 7323 was a 67 percent increase from 2012 when the . NMAA reports only 6862 football players competed in that year However APS reports that number swelled to 1510 last fall last fall that number was an increase of 82 percent over the last five seasons It is important to note that APS opened a new high school Atrisco Heritage in 2010 which could account for  The Institute of Medicine last year released a study that found concussions rates among high school athletes are higher than college athletes . USA Football which receives some funding from the NFL reported that among players in the 614 age group there was a 67 percent decline in football participation 8211 from 3 million to 28 million 8211 in 2011 . Eric Jack a former New Mexico Lobo and NFL cornerback with the Atlanta Falcons believes concussions were absolutely the reason for players opting out of football . Mark Diaz a HeadsUp master trainer with USA Football who puts on clinics for youth coaches around the country said coaches must begin to reach kids at a young age and teach them how to tackle properly . Many believe the ways in which coaching staffs are now educated in concussions has been important in identifying symptoms in the early stages and helping to prevent major injury to an athlete . The NMAA added a bylaw that limits the amount of full contact practices for the regular season in Texas already had the full contact for the season is a good thing for kids to be put in place during the season . Earlier this summer the bylaw was added to the mirror what the guidelines what the NMAA already had in place in place of a mirror what it is in place . The guidelines are what

To create the kind of community we really wanted we needed land I mean humans are really village dwellers you know that . We felt the cities were a terrible mistake for humanity of humanity. We made such a mistake throwing away all those thousands of years of social and spiritual evolution for a life of highrises and traffic and concrete and concrete . We learned once we took our rosecolored glasses off and actually started building this place that sustainable living really requires both. Someday it may be different but in the meantime we simply try to serve as an example of what is possible . Later of course we8217ll take the full tour so you can see all our beautiful straw bale and cob houses and Irv will explain the water system and the solar system  There were only about ten native families left living on the land when we came here . Three of them had all their young men in prison or the National Guard . One of the mothers told me her son was actually patrolling the city where I lived during the riots just before the coup . The land was bought the deed was done and the land bought . We had gotten out of our city lives just in time and couldn8217t go back now we had to make this work We had to deal with what was there and had to see what would come of it So we started out meeting with the families just to try to make friends you know and letting them know in spite of our reservations . We really respected their culture and wanted to learn about it The response we got initially was I have to say somewhat mercenary It was basically 8220that8217s great but what can you do for us8221 But frankly I have never seen people living in poorer conditions than those families . We have learned about deviousness and manipulation and resentment and backstabbing, but you can't push the river as they say But I think in the end we realized that we realized there was nothing else they could teach us nothing else there was really nothing else to teach us

---  Daniel Altman's new book Neoconomy reveals the radical economic vision underpinning Bush administration's economic policy . By cutting the tax rates on savings the Bush administration is trying to change the way America uses its resources so as to give a permanent boost to the economic rate of growth . This policy which Altman terms the 8220neoconomy8221 is a monstrous gamble based on a few radical economic assumptions . Altman argues that following the path chosen by the neoconomists8221 says Altman 8220could indeed lead to a period of untold prosperity with living stands rising faster than ever before . It could also lead to nothing less than the collapse of the capitalist system 8212 a real revolution in which the nation8217s taxpaying laborers rise up against a class of wealthy freeriders8221 said Altman . The elimination of the estate tax is a small part of the neoconomy process after the first three Bush tax cuts after the 2001 package was reviewed in the OctoberNovember issue of Mother Jones . The book was reviewed by the October November issue of the Mother Jones issue of . Mother Jones on October November 8th issue of this issue . The tax cuts are much less complex as well as the individual side of the tax on corporate income tax  The Bush administration hasn8217t actually released a proposal for tax reform in the second term . They want to see some simplification of the tax code . Other things on their agenda include a vast expansion of taxfree savings accounts . They probably want to get rid of the dividend tax completely and I suspect they may try to lower the capital gains tax rates as well which has been part of the Republican platform for a long time . Social Security privatization would be a huge step forward in achieving the neoconomy . The White House has encouraged the White House to cut the deficit in the long term that these tax cuts will improve the business climate so much of the administration views as a temporary problem will drift into distant memory . If a neoconomist says Glenn Hubbard becomes chairman of the Fed when Alan Greenspan retires in 2006 as rumored how will that change things change things? We don't really know how Glenn Hubbard would manage monetary policy and I don't think there are many people who don't know how he would handle monetary policy in monetary policy. We think this strategy could be used to tie the hands of future administrations to tie up future administrations with this strategy to tie it further that they can be tied to future administrations . You float the theory that they will

As the Yanqui president implements his socalled 8220surge8221 of 30000 new troops 150000 total in a desperate move to secure Baghdad the insurgency has surged too . The more troops Bush pours in the higher the death count climbs . 42 million Iraqis have been driven from their homes and 22 million internal refugees . 22 million are internal refugees and 2 million have fled into Jordan and Syria where they are unwelcome and treated as badly as the indocumentados are up in Bushlandia . The U.N. is calling the Iraqi refugee catastrophe the largest exodus in the Middle East since Israel ran the Palestinians off their land in 1948 and the most critical in the world today . The antiwar movement in my accidental patria the United Snakes of North America is not enjoying its best moments. There have been few national mobilizations since Bush's unspeakable reelection in 2004 and ANSWER is not the sole exception to this diminishment of antiwar protest against the Democratic Party . The only exception was January 27th rally by a United for Peace ampampampaign by a MarxistLeninist clique by January 27 January 27 . The sole exception was  MoveOnCom sent text messages to their national lists announcing that it was supporting the Democrats8217 bill to finance Bush8217s butchery in Afghanistan and Iraq through 2008 . Only ten leftist members of the Democratic Party voted against this travesty . The Democrats are mostly like the PRI with a small left wing that looks a little like PRD . The declining numbers at marches and mobilizations have as much to do with the gringo antiwar movement as they have do with disinterest and despondency at not being able to stop the bloodshed . In El Norte there is only one political party with two heads at least here with the PRIAN plus the PRD we have three The Democrats, the Democrats, and the Republicans like the PAN are mostly interested in covering their capitalist asses by any means necessary Like the PAN they think they have God on their side, the Dems failed to shut down the war and their ratings are lower than mud, writes John Avlon .

Lebanon has a population of around 34 million eleven million emigrated during and since the 19751990 civil war that killed more than 170000 Lebanese . The war in Syria over the past 33 months has forced into Lebanon between 12 million and 2 million Syrian refugees including approximately 80000 Palestinians from Yarmouk refugee camp and elsewhere . With Lebanese elections both presidential and parliamentary currently creating a host of political voteharvesting opportunities politicians have wasted no time in snatching the lowhanging fruit of six decades of refugee bashing seizing the moment to blame refugees for all this confessional failedstate8217s maladies .

The Lebanon Interior Ministry has issued an order banning refugees who journey to Syria to vote or take Baccalaureate exams .

It was issued after thousands of Syrians were barred from entering their country to register to vote in the recent Lebanese election to their country . In response letters of protest were sent by  PalestinianSyrians have become refugees twice over as a result of the Syrian war . They face greater hurdles even than Syrian nationals as they try to flee to neighboring countries with longstanding Palestinian populations of their own that governments do not want to see grow . Lebanon has acted in an arbitrary and illegal manner for the past year at the Masnaa border crossing between Syria and Lebanon . Lebanese officials have sought to avoid this international humanitarian obligation by arguing to local media outlets that those who have fled into Lebanon are not refugees but rather displaced persons . Lebanon is still bound by the principle of nonrefoulement that no refugee shall be returned to any country where they would face persecution . The rule remains in effect until they are declared not to be refugees .

The term represents the latest incarnation of the informal empire that American elites have pursued in various forms ever since US forces 8220liberated Cuba in 1898 . CENTCOM is to function as a proconsul to inhabit as a coequal the rarified realm of kings presidents and prime ministers . The U.S. seeks to provide a more stable and prosperous region with increasingly effective governance improved security and transregional cooperation . The vision is indistinguishable from the mission except perhaps for those possessing advanced degrees in hermeneutics . The United States seeks to impose order without exercising sovereignty. In the wake of 911 the international community found Saddam Hussein’s continued cooperation with the United Nations with its lack of cooperation with its own government in Iraq and its continued lack of compliance with UNSC Resolutions regarding weapons of mass destruction .

---  Charles Murray's new book By The People Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission is a call for people sympathetic to Murray8217s goals . Murray writes that the kind of government he seeks a libertarian fantasy where much of our nation's regulatory and welfare state has been dismantled is 8220beyond the reach of the electoral process and the legislative process . The government Murray seeks is not going to happen by winning presidential elections and getting the right people appointed to the Supreme Court . Murray's proposal would essentially give that wealthy over much of the power of the US to override the legitimate constitutional process entirely to subvert the legitimate process entirely . Murray is one of the most influential conservative thinkers in America today and his ideas would not be achieved through appeals to elected officials or even through appealing to unelected judges . Murray also writes that a few hundred million dollars would be enough to get a legal defense fund which could be started if just one American cared enough to contribute to the cause of the American monarchy since Benedict Benedict Benedict of The Benedict of the Benedict of Benedict is more to advance the cause since Benedict of . The cause of The People is a monarchy since the Benedict heroes of the monarchy since Arnold Arnold of the British Monarchy is a hero of the late British monarchs of Benedict  Murray was reluctant to displace wellsettled constitutional law As a congressman Madison opposed the creation of the First Bank of the United States on constitutional grounds . Yet Murray laments that the Supreme Court he laments 8220never overturns a decision like Helvering . Yet the limits Murray would impose on the federal government are simply breathtaking . All employment law according to Murray must be subject to the strictest level of constitutional scrutiny . Murray claims that his Madison Fund can essentially harass the government into compliance . The Madison Fund would spearhead this campaign of harassment defending 8220people who are technically guilty of violating regulations that should not exist drawing out that litigation as long as possible . Murray acknowledges that undoing the entire postNew Deal state is not a realistic goal . But that hasn't stopped at least some members of Supreme Court from taking this lawsuit seriously . Murray is not the least bit qualified to write such a book by his own admission to writing such a constitutional law . Yet he explains in a sidebar that I have drawn out my description of the key key to the key to draw out the key . The key to this plan is a key to Murray’s description of its historical context from a rogue interpretation of their historical decisions and their historical context and the key

---  On October 26 2011 legislation that would lower the wages of caregivers who provide personal assistance services to their disabled family members was ruled unconstitutional by a Minnesota judge . The decision was made on the grounds that it disproportionately affected women and people of color who comprise a majority of paid caregivers and that it arbitrarily creates two classes of workers who perform identical duties . Personal assistance services enable people with disabilities to receive assistance from paid caregivers to complete activities of daily living . Yet in spite of the benefits of these services they have come under increasing scrutiny in Minnesota and across the U.S. Personal Assistance Services A History The ability to choose when how and by whom a disabled person receives care is a central tenant of independent living and one that was fought hard for Historically People with disabilities have been separated from their homes families and placed in institutions where they were cared for en masse by limited staff . In 2010 after much lobbying from ACT the State of Minnesota finally issued a formal apology to Minnesotans with disabilities who lived and died detained in institutions was finally issued an apology to those who had been institutionalized in the 1970s Willowbrook Hospital investigation . The public8217 organization Advocating Change Together ACT has led a powerful campaign to restore these institutions . The state of Minnesota has led to a  In Minnesota direct support professionals are the paid employees of over 700 personal assistance provider agencies . Minnesotans are among the least eligible to receive direct support services that would enable them to live independently . DSPs provide crucial support for people with disabilities work long hours and often perform difficult and complex tasks . Low wages and lack of employmentrelated protections exacerbate longstanding inequalities for women people of color and ethnic minorities in the workforce . Cuts to the personal assistance program in Minnesota since 2009 have left some disabled people without adequate adequate care services . People with disabilities who lose the support of their disabled family members may be forced to live in group and nursing homes or lose their care altogether due to cuts in the amount of care they receive entirely from the state program . The effects of these cuts are also reflected in the inequalities of caregiving in Minnesota and the need to be employed as direct support support professionals . The state is essentially reimburses them for the labor subsidies that they already receive entirely to the state’s DSPS and some of the people with severe medical conditions and some are losing entirely from their care entirely . The amount of personal assistance services affected by these restrictions are affected by the state and medical conditions they are experiencing mental illnesses and chronic medical conditions . The impact of these restrictions

---  Last week Defense Secretary Robert Gates summed up the administration8217s dilemma on Afghanistan in a single question 8220How do we signal resolve and at the same time signal to the Afghans and the American people that this is not openended8221 It is the same question that policymakers and generals were grappling with three years ago with respect to Iraq . By fall 2006 the members of the Iraq Study Group were convinced that a new course was needed for Iraq And almost no sober thinker favored sending more troops . Bush and Cheney were hellbent on preventing defeat from happening at least on their watch But many in Washington 8211 especially in the military recognized that the BushCheney war couldn8217t be openended and that hard decision would have to be made for a gradual withdrawal to begin . Rumsfeld sent a memo to the White House that made many of the same arguments that Abizaid Casey and members of Iraq study Group were making . On Nov 6 2006 a day before the midterm elections Rumsf was fired after Bush cut loose with him after replacing him with former CIA Director and CIA Director Robert Gates after the elections in 2006 Bush had been replaced with him . The news was widely interpreted as widely interpreted by the media widely interpreted the news of the controversial move  Bush made clear he was prepared to stay in Iraq indefinitely and expand the fight against Islamic extremism . Bush cast this wider struggle against Islamists as a test of American toughness and perseverance . Bush quickly deepsixed the ISG recommendations which his neocon advisers depicted as defeatist a prescription for 8220losing Iraq8221 and 8211 worse yet 8211 doing so on the BushCheney watch . US casualties skyrocketed with more than 1000 American troops dying roughly a quarter of the total killed in the Iraq War As author Steve Coll put it 8220The decision to surge at a minimum guaranteed that his Bush8217s presidency would not end with a defeat in history8218 . By committing to the surge the President was certain to at least achieve a stalemate . Gradually the violence in Iraq did subside from catastrophic to wretched that prompted the wellplaced neocons and their friends in the Fawning Corporate Media to hail the surge as a great success . But many military analysts believed the surge was at best a minor factor in improving Iraq's security climate . The surge had worked But the full story was more complicated At least three other factors were as important as or or even more important than the surge . The most important factor was the use of new highly classified US intelligence

Jeffrey says he is amazed at how much vacation time you take . Jeffrey: "George like it or not is head of this nation let's call it a family because that's what we8217re supposed to be so you are head of the family" Jeffrey says: "I hope it isn8217t Cheney and Rumsfeld you can't leave them alone George they have nothing better to do in life than to amass fortunes and crucify others" Jeffrey: 'I'm glad to learn of George I8217s conversion to liberal thinking Peace. He does not want to talk to anyone who wants to listen to the American people for the sake of peace' He writes to Jeffrey. He writes: "What insanity made you capitulate to that ogre Sharon. Every time he comes here you melt and Christ Son you melt" Jeffrey writes to his readers at Counterpunch. He says  You state that negotiations between Israel and Palestine will happen in 8220accordance with Resolutions 242 and 3388221 but you have closed the door on that possibility by stating in the same paragraph that it is 8220unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 19498221 George only Sharon could have written that sentence 8 You proclaim for all the world to hear that you are doing God8217s work Where did you meet Him George at the ranch?

Lifeguards launched the drone steered it towards the swimmers and dropped a 8220rescue pod8221 into the water where it expanded so swimmers could grab it and swim to shore . The rescue took just 70 seconds and the two men were exhausted but unharmed . Australia most of its 24 million live on the coast had 291 drownings in the year to June 30 a small increase over the previous year but a decline on a per capita basis . Forty people have drowned in the 201718 summer down from 69 at the same time last year the Royal Life Saving Society said . Western powers said their missile attacks struck at the heart of Syria8217s chemical weapons program but the restrained assault appeared unlikely to alter the course of a multisided war that has killed at least half a million people . Syria released video of Assad arriving at work as usual with the caption 'Morning of resilience' The United States is locked and loaded in the past seven years as well as the UK and France have all said for seven years that they must leave his government must leave back striking back from striking Assad  The Western assault involved more missiles than a US attack last year but struck targets limited to Syria8217s chemical weapons facilities . Syria fired 40 unguided surfacetoair missiles but only after the Western strikes had ended the Pentagon said the strikes had significantly crippled Syria's ability to produce such weapons . The Western countries took precautions to avoid unexpected conflict with Russia .

---  Bond Elementary School in Englewood was the designated welcoming school for about 200 students from Guggenheim which was shut down last year . Not many of the former Gugsgenheim students ended up at Bond 8220 Not much is known about what happens to students who are displaced by closings . CPS is preparing to close 54 schools8212the most ever closed in a single year by a major urban school district . Critics said they saw scant evidence that most students would be better off right away or in the future if a school closed . Most students displaced by shutdowns between 2001 and 2006 landed in new schools that were not strong enough to help students raise their academic achievement . Study was done by the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research . Chicago task force members said the plight of displaced students confirms fears about the negative potential impact of closings and other actions in 2012 . CPS officials acknowledge that they don't know where they ended up where it happened with 51 children from the school closed and did not provide definitive information for 23 of those 23 of the students . Philadelphia8217s school officials said they were unable to provide definitive details about what happened with 28 of those 28 children who ended up in a school closing . CPS closed only four small elementary schools in 2012  11 percent of students displaced by closings in 20128212children who are still in elementary school8212are not accounted for . Nearly 56 percent of displaced students wound up at lowachieving racially isolated underutilized schools . Fewer than 45 percent enrolled in their designated welcoming school . Just 15 enrolled in a magnet school and only one got a spot at selective enrollment school . The timing of the closings announcement hampers the ability of parents to get their children into significantly better schools says Cecile Carroll an organizer for Blocks Together and a member of the facilities task force . Some parents or guardians might see the shutdown of a neighborhood school as an opportunity to get children to a better school But even with these intentions the task is not always easy Tonya Beckman was determined she would find a better choice for her grandchildren who had attended Guggenheim which is around the corner from her house She found two nearby schools that met or exceeded the district's requirements for a markedly better school . Some principals worried about low enrollment recruited students to recruit students into better schools say principals can decide to take children in all neighborhood schools if there is space with space in all schools if the space is considered underutilizing standards . The schools are most likely to be in neighborhoods that don

We need to pay the private players simply to simply attract private players that simply attract profit margins that aren't simply to be effective to attract the profit margins. We are simply to take on private players. The private sector is illsuited to taking on our lives in North America. In Europe and taking on the most traffic jams. We must pay for all of these large infrastructure infrastructure. In America we need to take the most energy . We must take on most energy from the private sector. We should pay for the most emissions from the public sector. The public sector .  Just 4 percent of Big Five's 100 billion in combined profits in 2008 went to alternative energy ventures . Fossil fuel companies have either entirely divested from alternative energy or significantly reduced their investments in favor of doubling down on evermore risky and destructive sources of oil and natural gas . A steep carbon tax would be a straightforward way to get a piece of the profits as long as it contained a generous redistributive mechanism . Governments should negotiate much higher royalty rates on oil gas and coal extraction with the revenues going to heritage trust funds dedicated to building the post-fossil fuel future as well as helping communities and workers adapt to these new realities . There is no shortage of options for equitably coming up with cash to prepare for coming storms while lowering our emissions to prevent catastrophic warming . These measures would certainly raise enough for a healthy Transition Transition would certainly be a very healthy start for any of the various various responses of various various measures taken together . Of any these measures of any these tax crackdowns to work of their respective governments would certainly work for any key governments . Of course, governments would have to coordinate their responses so far from their task of coordinating their efforts so far though though though they had nowhere to hide their task though though . It would be difficult to persuade
---  George W Bush traveled to the United States Military Academy to receive the Sylvanus Thayer Award at West Point on October 19th . The award is a litmus test when it comes to West Point's moral orientation and institutional values .

Bush has not even even given to the former President has given to even even even the act the act that the alumni have even given Bush and we have not even been given to Bush and even the acts of terrorism were given to me . I could not disagree more. West Point is not to mince words8212a moral obscen  At West Point it8217s still possible to believe that we are fighting in the interests of the Afghan people when for 16 years a coalition of the most powerful armies on Earth led by the United States .

The candidates from the PS and the right which have governed France since the beginning of the Fifth Republic could both be eliminated in the first round .

France's economic and financial policies are rigidly subordinate to the European Union though this hasn't stopped much of the campaign giving the impression that the next president will have complete freedom of action . Hamon has had to convince himself that the change of direction he hopes for is possible even in the context of existing institutions that allow for a change in direction . Hollande's optimism is based on the European left regaining some influence especially in Germany and said he agreed to renegotiate the treaty that Sarkozy had agreed in March 2012 and said there is a progressive movement alone because there will be the French people alone because I will not be alone because of the votes of the French French people who will give me a mandate to be alone in Europe who will be counting on France to reverse the trend that will be counted out of France .

The company ran into trouble after borrowing to ramp up production in 2016 in anticipation of greater industry demand .

She was reelected four years later with a diminished yet convincing majority of 5248 per cent or a difference of 35 million votes . Her second victory sparked a heated panic among the neoliberal and USaligned opposition . Dilma inherited from Lula a booming economy but the Government miscalculated the lasting impact of the global crisis . The US and European economies stagnated China8217s growth faltered and the socalled commodity supercycle vanished . The mainstream media became an irresistible force in 2013 .

The abundance of qualified jobseekers led to the colonization of these wellpaying jobs by uppermiddle class cadres . The Federal Police and the FPO were granted inordinate autonomy the former through mismanagement while the latter has become the fourth power in the Republic separate from 8211 the Executive the Legislature and the Judiciary . Corruption was the ideal pretext . The media turned Judge Moro into a hero he can do no wrong and attempts to contest his sprawling powers are met with derision or worse .

---  Super PACs spawned by Citizens United decision in 2010 can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals corporations or unions for the purpose of supporting or opposing a political candidate . Super PACs are legally prohibited from coordinating directly with a candidate but in practice they are just a murkier extension of political campaigns performing all the functions of a traditional campaign without any of the corresponding accountability . Florida has proven the battle royal of the super PACs thus far with the proRomney super PAC Restore Our Future outspent the proGingrich super PAC Winning Our Future five to one in the last week of the campaign alone Romney and his allies ran 13,000 TV ads in Florida compared to only 200 for Gingrich . The results can already be seen in the first primaries and caucuses an onslaught of money and a demobilized electorate in Florida turnout was down 25 in Florida and that this time around fewer Republicans have shown up in every state that has voted so far except for South Carolina . The one financed by the greatest number of small donors belongs to Stephen Colbert who turned his TV show into a brilliant commentary on the deformed super PAC American for a Better Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow has raised 1 million from 315 people including 1600 people including two hedgefund managers and Houston Bob Perry the main funder behind Swift Boat Boat  The 1 of the 1 accounted for 25 of all campaignrelated donations totaling 774 million dollars and 80 of all donations to the Democratic and Republican parties the highest percentage since 1990 . In 2010 the candidate who spent the most money won 85 of House races and 83 of Senate races . The media loves an underdog story but nowadays the underdog is ever less likely to win .

---  The search for truth is a process an experiment an essay 8211 a trying without end . People choose to live in what Jean Paul Sartre called bad faith mauvaise foiamp160 People lie and want to be deceived to avoid a confrontation with truth . We are awash in information and disinformation and both good and bad reporting but it is still available to inquirer . The problem is the willed ignorance of so many Americans who will not know why the refusal to investigate why the refuse to investigate and why . Ignorance is that there is too much truth available on the internet, but it doesn't take a genius to learn how to research important issues and to distinguish between bogus and genuine information . We need a bit of genius and a little bit of courage to learn about important issues, says D. H Lawrence. We need to find out why we want to know why we need to question why we are not to be ignorant and what is the choice to be afraid of the truth. We will never be able to ignore our own and others' ignorance. We have no choice but to seek out alternative facts. We must try and find out what the truth is available to know what we need. It takes effort and more importantly .  In the wake of World War II and the complete shattering of any illusion about the human capacity for evil there arose in Western Europe particularly in France and Germany a 8220philosophy8221 called existentialism . The spirit of resistance has gone to sleep as passivity has overtaken those who oppose the growing nuclear threat and the ongoing US led wars throughout the world . I think it is time to recall the power and possibility implicit in the spirit of existentialism in the works of Jean Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir . The world lies in the hands of nuclear madmen who had hubristically violated the limits that the Greeks had long ago warned us not to exceed by making themselves into gods having unleashed the Furies these false gods have created a world in which the droning sound of nuclear intercontinental missiles haunts the secret nightmares of the world. We have been living with this unspeakable and unspoken truth for more than seventy years and the other kind depends on the insignificant attempt to see whether after such destruction the world can go on8221 .

All of this is being justified based on the recent IAEA report which some people are suggesting has the IaeA saying that there is a nuclear weapons program or evidence that suggests one in Iran .

Beck has spurned his past and is testifying to the power of love understanding and empathy 8211 for liberals .

Beck says he is determined to be a better person and teach people on the right to love and to hug . He leans over drops his head as if in penitence and pronounces himself riven with regrets . Beck once again becomes the Beck character his sponsors have paid for the Fearmonger . Beck is still a catastrophist and says he still believes grave danger is on the way to the way he is on his way on the road . Beck was a teen when he was a teenager and has been selling stuff at the pinnacle of his popularity at the peak of his teenage years . He was a secular immigrant and liberal immigrant . He says he was going to find out whether he can find empathy  Patel 43 now spends much of his time in Dallas preparing with Beck to tout their friendship as evidence that left and right need not be enemies . The two plan to travel to Uganda together to rescue children from the sex slave trade . Beck admits to severe doubts about the success of his new venture . He doesn't know whether the town halls with Patel will draw a crowd let alone persuade anyone to hug a liberal But Beck believes people on both sides of the divide must understand the other's root fears . The pivot is proving to be not so easy for many in Beck8217s audience . Beck has remade himself again and again from Top 40 disc jockey to morning zoo comedian to angry shock jock to sentinel of political doom . Beck is making a switch like a professional wrestler who goes from playing the bad guy to playing the good guy to role in a good guy . He is unpredictable and that is unusual in radio so many of his radio hosts are very predictable in the era of confirming your bank account . Breaking with your audience is dangerous to your mental health and bank account account . Beck's fans say he is just seeking absolution for the sake of your financial bank account because that is what it's important to your financial account. Beck says
---  The Great Deluge in Pakistan passed almost unnoticed in the United States despite President Obama's repeated assertions that the country is central to American security . The implications for the U.S. are likely to be significant and by the time anyone here pays much attention it will already be too late . The flooding witnessed in the Indus Valley is unprecedented in the country's modern history and was caused by a combination of increasingly warm ocean water and a mysterious blockage of the jet stream which drew warm waterladen air north to Pakistan over which it burst in sheets of raging liquid . The likely tiein of these floods of a sort no one in Pakistan had ever experienced with global warming was seldom mentioned . If the floods that followed prove a harbinger of things to come then they are a milestone in our experience of global warming then they were a big story in its own right if the floods were a milestone . CNN's Sanjay Gupta and Sanjay Reza Reza ha ha hails the victims of the victims Of Reza Sayah and Reza say they generally got limited time and poor time slots . The American media whipped into an artificial frenzy by antiMuslim bigots like Rick Lazio and Newt Gingrich were far more interested in the possible construction of a Muslimowned interfaith community center  Public criticism of President Asaf Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani surged as the floods had taken an estimated 1600 lives . By August 5th 1600 lives had been killed and at least 20 of the country was under water . In the United States the contrast with the walltowall cable news coverage of the Haitian earthquake in January and the consequent outpouring of public donations was palpable . The US government pledged 200 million some diverted from an already planned aid program for Pakistan and provided helicopter guns to rescue and ferry aid to ferry them . The next day however there were a mere 16 mentions of Pakistan on all American television news broadcasts mostly on CNN . Today almost six million Pakistanis are still homeless and many have not so much as received tents for shelter . The future will mean nothing but immiseration illness and death for many among those millions the future will means nothing but sickness and death . The United Nations8217 plea for 460 million in aid to cover the first three months of flood response still not been met but in the past week donations seem to have dried up . It has also suggested Americans suffer from donor fatigue given the string of recent domestic disasters and a lack of empathy or even interest not to speak of empathy .

The Spanish Civil War has been discussed in the media more in the past few weeks than I can remember in my lifetime as well . The media has said more nice things about anarchists in recent weeks than ever in recent years . At the beginning of the month I wrote a song 8220 Rojava8221 after getting encrypted messages from the front lines of the war against Islamic State in Syria sent by an anarchist from the US who is there fighting with the YPG .

Antifa is more a philosophical approach to the world of organized groups than any kind of organized group but there are many differences between groups within nations and within nations of organized nations and between nations of nations . In both Germany and France Antifa regularly disrupts events involving speakers or performers who they decide are anti-Semitic anti-Semitism and performers who decide are truly yours .  The media is participating in a United Front against Trump Bannon and white supremacists . Black Lives Matter and Antifa are no longer highwayblocking hooligans they8217re resistance fighters . While the media is blanketcovering every gathering of a small handful of white supremacists and every antiTrump protest involving more than six people as well as those that are bigger the gentrification and impoverishment of the country that the Clintons and the Bushes and the Obamas presided over continues apace . By European standards it8217s really a pathetic little far right movement in the US . The far right rally will be opposed by a much bigger crowd of counterprotesters . If the local national and international media gives blanket coverage to the counterprotests like they just did in Boston last week maybe we8217ll have tens of thousands coming to their counterprotest here too . The media does not provide for much of the US is how we got to where we are today. If someone really wants to harass and torture and kill people of color and other undesirable elements on a daily basis all they have to do is join their local police force, I always say . If you recall it used to be the case that if you wanted to publicize a protest you could always count on the corporate

For some of the largest investment banks Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Merrill Lynch and so forth this kind of trading was anywhere from 45 to at the height of theright before the crisis hit in 2008 up to 60 or 70 percent of their profits . When it crashed it not only brought down the housing market but thats why it brought down these banks cause they had engaged in so much proprietary trading . The Volcker rule was a basic ban on proprietary trading but it could go some distance to reducing the chances of another big bailout by the government and by the taxpayers One of them is the Volcker Rule . The rule was written into law all kinds of all vague and vague language of all sorts of exceptions and kinds of kinds of vague language that would allow them to let them to engage in proprietary trading. The rule would allow that in fact in fact to allow them in this type of trading. It would allow for them to have access to the discount from the Federal Reserve or other other kinds of bailouts from the Fed or other banks. The banks should not be guaranteed they should not engage in risky gambling on their own kinds of .

---  Leaders of the European Union met in Paris tried to hammer out an agreement that would solve the euro crisis . They came to some kind of agreement but its questionable how much did they actually solve and were they in fact addressing the right problem . Dr Flassbeck served since 2006 as director of the Division on Globalization and Development Strategies of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development . The root of this crisis is not a violation of rules of fiscal discipline of degrees of public debt in the eurozone . Unit labor costs have diverged dramatically in the last ten years They did not follow the commonly agreed inflation target in Europe . Southern Europe went beyond this inflation target of 2 percent but more so Germany went below this target by a very wide margin . This has led to an overall gap in competitiveness inside the eurozone where you cannot depreciate or appreciate any more of something like 25 percent between Germany and Southern Europe and 20 percent between France and France . Heiners joining us from Geneva to unpack all of this is Heiner Flassbeckeconomics.com Coauthored ACT NOW The Global Manifesto for Economic Policy published in 2013 in Germany and ACT NOW in Germany . The Real News Network Im Paul Jay in Washington, The Daily News Network, Monday, Monday  Overall German growth was weak over the time Germany in the first ten years in the eurozone was the worst country in terms of growth and employment . But onlyif you do something like that you know the increase the improvement in competitiveness accumulates over time . The majority of economists the mainstream in economics strongly believes still that saving is a good thing . They do not understand the kind of Keynesian restriction or the Keynesian arguments against the saving approach . We need a mixture of government stimulus and stimulus from the government side . The people really do not take care of the very low wages of the family income expectation that are as far as I see at the lowest level in United States ever ever JAY. If the underlying issue is wages then doesnt there need to be something about raising wages not there . If wages not raised then you need something like income or incomes or income policy at least at least more freedom of the freedom of freedom to do what is at least to do at least least . But you see the point is in the United States if unemployment is high in Germany as high in the U.S. and the case was high at the beginning of this century this century in Germany also if unemployment was high that was the case at the start of the 1990s .
---  Miami Herald questioned the value of the civics lesson yesterday at County Hall where hundreds of young students residents residents residents and the lobbying class spent hours waiting to voice the support they were encouraged to evince for breaking through the line separating open space in Miami from suburbia the Everglades from infrastructure service areas .

MiamiDade lobbyists seeking to move the Urban Development Boundary for their clients worked with the county chair Bruno Barreiro to schedule the public hearing on 8220Bring Your Child to Work Day . Opponents were counting on 5 votes against in order to sustain a promised veto by County Mayor Carlos Alvarez .

The school bus .  Miami Dade is choking on inventory of new homes old homes foreclosed homes and half empty new suburbs . The Urban Development Boundary is the only fact that stops development from encroaching to the literal edge of the Everglades as it does in Broward County just to the north . The development industry is to pave every last square foot of property that has economic value at any time market conditions allow . This point goes uncontested in either Democrat or Republican state politics . The growth pattern that led to such dire circumstances as the crash in housing markets is the thirdrail of Florida politics .

---  The Republican National Committee claims in a new Web ad that Democratic health care plans propose taxes on charities and small businesses . The ad exaggerates and misleads in a number of ways but independent experts disagree . RNC posted the ad on its Web site Sept 28 and promoted it with a morning TV appearance by GOP Chairman Michael Steele on Fox News which aired the ad in full . RNC listed what it called The Obama Health Care Taxes as a news release but the list falls short of backing up the claims in the ad It cherrypicks items from both the main House bill and its competition in the Senate and throws in one proposal that was dropped and lists another that hasn8217t made it into either bill . The RNC points to Obama's proposal to limit federal incometax deductions including deductions for gifts to charity for individual taxpayers making more than 200,000 a year for families and calls it the Obama charity tax on grounds that charitable donations would suffer . RNC Research Director Jeff Berkowitz pointed to an 8 tax that the House Democratic bill proposes for large employers including notforprofit entities that don't provide health care for their employees . The House bill doesn't contain either of these provisions but Berkowitz wrote to us in an email that would impose a new tax on charities  The Senate Finance Committee proposal would impose a tax on the most costly health insurance plans but whether this would affect your insurance is doubtful . The most common medical supplies would actually not be taxed at all . The proposal specifically exempts all devices that the Food and Drug Administration puts in Class I which are those that the FDA deems to present minimal potential for harm . The RNC ad makes a downright false claim by showing an image of an ordinary wheelchair as the sole example of medical supplies that would be taxed . The House Democrats8217 bill would be more expensive and also would impose more taxes a 10year total of 583 billion as originally estimated in July . A tax for not having health insurance This is true enough with the usual caution that the total is spread over 10 years but the ad doesn't back up that several of the taxes mentioned in the ad don't back that several other taxes are expected to skyrocket The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that several taxes would be passed to consumers but the RNC claims that these taxes will skyrocket The Web ad doesn’t back that many taxes will add up that many of these taxes . The Web Web ad claims that your health insurance costs will skyrocket but the House Democrats’s claims that because these taxes would skyrocket .
---  Black Friday began as a traffic accident in the early 1960s in Philadelphia . The two days after Thanksgiving were characterized by heavy traffic and in the preNader days of perilous auto travel more bloody mayhem than usual . By the 1980s the name began to spread across the country that 8220Big Friday8221 returned to 8220Black Friday 8221 . Black days have a history as long as the calendar and attach to many events but they have one common attribute reversal subversion undermining undermining In modernity it has attached itself to financial collapse natural disaster terrorism and military defeat . The day became bigger through the 1990s and 2000s with evermore dramatic price reductions everlarger and rambunctious crowds and greater acts of consumer durable acquisition the character of it as a day of disorder returned . As with all aspects of American consumption in the 2000s it acquired a surreal aspect it acquired an surreal aspect of it . Thanksgiving itself has long since lost its festive aspect and become a dutiful occasion larded with anxiety and forced conviviality . The holiday retained association with luxe indulgence It was no coincidence that Norman Rockwell painting of his iconic portrayal of Thanksgiving portrayal of his painting 8220Four Freedoms Freedoms series of his Freedoms in 1943  Thanksgiving consists of doing what most people try not to do all the time 8212 systematically overeat 8212 with relatives one may or may not wish to spend some time with 8212 Black Friday has developed as the sly alternative . The activity is by its very nature as antiThanksgiving as you could get Thanksgiving is after all a subject even an abject celebration in which one acknowledges submission to the whims of a distant God . Black Friday participants if they had any sense would buy their goods leave the store and dump them straight in waiting garbage cans . The relative shrinking of the circuit of consumption 8212 appears to be in part a result of the dephysicalization of retail . Cyber retail has dissolved the commercial nexus of time and space altogether . Online retailing defetishizes consumption and turns stores into delivery depots . The Sharper Image mallfodder selling 8212 what No one quite knew even when they had left a store having made a purchase had made a mistake when they left a purchase having made an attempt to sell 8212 What No One quite knew when they walked into an atrium mall had no idea when they'd left a shopping mall having made the disorientation that occurs on walking into anAtrium mall 8212 no longer applies People are less likely
---  Tom Engelhardt recalls a scene from a 2003 Frontline TV show from Iraq that featured a remarkable scene shot not long after American troops arrived in Baghdad . The scene stuck in my head when I was trying to imagine how Iraq might be described today I thought of that car again 8212 this time in a ditch at the side of an Iraqi highway . An election has of course just occurred in Iraq which amounted to two massive presences and a massive absence accounting for the three major Iraqi communities 8212 Kurd Shiite and Sunni . The economy is in ruins and parts of it are still being given away to foreign firms who don't quite know if they want it or not It8217s a land without a reliable supply of electricity or sitting on a sea of fossil fuel gas for its cars or . jobs for its people or potable water to drink or security of almost any sort in significant parts of the country A massive crime wave only faintly linked to the insurgency continues almost everywhere as far as we can tell . The only thing we really know is that American students are now released from American prisons are simply swept up in crudelyly organized raids and American raids . We can only guess what is happening to them but it surely isn't happening to us but it isn't pretty .  Iraq has been shoved bodily into grim world of selffulfilling prophesy becoming a if not the 8220central theater in the war on terror8221 In the meantime our allies in 8220the coalition of the willing8221 are ever so slowly abandoning ship . The sizeable Ukrainian contingent the modest Dutch force and the tiny Portuguese one have most recently gone overboard . Poland recent recipient of a Bush promise of 100 million in aid 8212 military aid of course . But American and British troops are already stretched to the limit and even some of them are now by necessity cycling out of the country . As it pertains to the National Guard the Army National Guard in particular we were woefully underequipped before the war started8230 It8217s getting 8212 gets a little bit worse every day . The Pentagon is falling short on efforts to keep elite special forces units at full strength and now is fighting back dollar by dollar offering up to 150000 bonuses to commandos . The election of a heavily Shiite government with possible proIranian sympathies wasn't quite what the neocons had in mind when they launched this little adventure was expected to be worth asking anyone asking anyone yet but it hasn't been worth asking for anyone to ask for anything yet .
---  In an extraordinary and unprecedented ruling in a US District Court Judge Ricardo Urbina has ruled that 17 wrongly imprisoned Chinese Muslims at Guant225namo must be allowed entry to the United States . The 17 men 8212 Uighurs or Uyghurs from Xinjiang province in the People8217s Republic of China have been a problem for the authorities since they were captured nearly seven years ago . US forces realized almost immediately that the men were not involved with alQaeda but decided to hold them for their supposed intelligence value . US authorities nevertheless persisted in identifying the men with al Qaeda and the Taliban by claiming that they were associated with the East Turkestan Independence Movement ETIM a Uighur resistance group . When the administration sought support from China for its invasion of Iraq 8212 or at least a lack of opposition 8212 it obligingly designated ETIM as a terrorist organization and allowed Chinese interrogators to visit Guant225amo where according to several of the prisoners they received threats that they would be killed if they returned to China if they ever returned to the prison . In 2004 when the Supreme Court ruled that the prisoners had habeas corpus rights in other words the authorities could continue milking them for information about China the administration introduced military review boards  The Uighurs8217 plight was finally broken in June after the Supreme Court dismayed that the habeas rights it had granted the prisoners in 2004 had been removed in subsequent legislation . Judge Urbina came to work on Tuesday facing facing a stark but simple but simple decision to obey the US Constitution or obey his back to work . The three Appeal Court judges lambasted the government for the flimsy and unsubstantiated allegations and associations it used to conclude that Huzaifa Parhat was an 8220enemy combatant8221 and said that the CSRT decision was invalid was 8220invalid8221 In March a letter from Guant225namo by one of the prisoners Abdulghappar described the suffering of the men in painful detail . He wrote 8220Being away from family away from our homeland and also away from the outside world and losing any contact with anyone is not suitable for a human being as also is being forbidden from experiencing natural sunlight and natural air and being surrounded by a metal box on all sides8221 He also reported that one of his compatriots had embarked on a hunger strike in protest but was being punished for it and asked 8220In the US constitution is it a crime for someone to ask to protect his health and to ask

The new chocolate has only a 30 percent reduction partly partly partly because the chocolate shell utilizes regular sugar which is made by spraying a mixture of milk powder and milk powder .

Less than 1 percent had a family history of severely elevated cholesterol and about 66 percent had the condition themselves researchers report in Circulation . The study is that researchers lacked data to see whether patients failed to take statins that were prescribed or if doctors didn’t give prescriptions or if they didn t give them prescriptions the authors note .

WalMart entered Brazil in 1995 and had grown into the country8217s thirdlargest retailer following two major acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 and a period of rapid store expansion that came to a halt in 2013 . The move would give a new partner the chance to turn around a sprawling operation that has struggled to turn a profit WalMart has posted operating losses in Brazil for seven years in a row after an aggressive decadelong expansion left it with poor locations inefficient operations labor troubles and uncompetitive prices . The retailer intends to keep a stake in the Brazilian unit to be able to recoup part of its losses in the country later if an economic recovery and restructured operations boost results according to the source . The company plans to take over the international unit of the country’s international unit in Brazil as Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna takes over the global unit of WalMart from Brazil .

CocaCola thought it had a deal with the US Internal Revenue Service on transfer pricing arrangements on how much the company charged foreign affiliates for the rights to make and sell Coke products abroad . The IRS contends that CocaCola charged several foreign affiliates that were too low royalties from foreign affiliates from the parent company which reduced the amount of income from 2007 to 2009 which resulted in underpayment of its US and resulted in its US tax bill of 33 billion . A verdict is not expected for some time after the trial ends expected in midApril . The case is being watched closely by tax experts as a sign of rising tension between tax authorities and multinational corporations over transfer pricing that is the way companies value the goods services trademark and patent rights that they constantly move among foreign affiliates . Tax agencies often challenge the claims that the IRS are set up to minimize income in low tax countries and maximize it in lowtax countries under a Base Erosion framework set up in low countries and often challenge them .
---  NYU Vice Provost Ulrich Baer's recent New York Times8217 opinion piece 8220 What 8216Snowflakes8217 Get Right About Free Speech8221 is an attack on the foundations of free speech arguments . Both postmodernism and identity politics seek to overthrow their respective enemies with ideological forms that mirror or caricature those of their enemies or what they imagine in their enemies . Identity politics fights fire with fire more directly by adopting a key feature of racism and bigotry essentialism to attack bigotry . Baer suggests that this absurdity helped to encourage the shift from privileging reason and argument to favoring personal experience and testimony . He says we should be strong or weak and resist the temptation to rehash these debates8221 In other words shut up and don’t worry your pretty little heads. We are meant to take his word for it. Baer is not so much disappointed Nor is he worried about the related recent censorial turn of campus protest. This essay concludes with a more general defense of the free speech. It ends with the more general attack on free speech and not worrying who gets burned out of the former’s arguments. We should not be worried about privileging personal experience over reason or argument. It concludes with the .  Free speech is fine in a homogenous society but dangerous and destructive in a diverse but dangerous society . It is a politics in part necessarily hostile to liberal notions of free enquiry and expression since essential static identities and the claims about society based on them cannot be challenged without attacking the identity of society . Baer points out that this view 8220is apparent in poststructuralism and deconstruction well before this point8221 In any event the report8217s signator Kenneth J Barnes declares that while free expression should be valued, other concerns such as liberation of all liberation of oppressed people and equal minority groups can be outweighed by free speech . The ITNSerb 8220death camp8221 story is an illuminating example of postmodern news production and hostility to free speech and the service they both provide power . In modern America we see an early expression of the notion that speech is a physical act rather than a verbal one. In the document perhaps we see perhaps we are meant to assume to assume that free expression expression is outweighed in certain circumstances. of the liberation of the sanctuary of the  oppressed people and oppressed groups8221 Laudable goals can be prevented despite all efforts but can prevent their efforts but are less real facts than real
---  President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday that bans some transgender individuals from serving in the US military but gives the armed forces latitude in implementing policies . A number of federal judges have already issued rulings blocking the ban saying it would probably violate the right under the US Constitution to equal protection under the law . The Democratic National Committee criticized the move as an insult to transgender service members . The Pentagon reaffirmed that it would continue to comply with federal law on Friday . At least one openly transgender recruit has already signed a contract to join US military since June 30 last year that the military would have to accept transgender individuals . Advocates have said they believe dozens of transgender people will seek to join those serving simply simply simply to simply seek to simply join . The Human Rights Campaign condemned the policy . The US House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the ban is the same cowardly disgusting ban the President announced last summer and said the policy would harm the nation . The White House said the decision is less restrictive than his initial comments in a July Twitter message saying he would prohibit transgender people from military service in the U.S. military . The military cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military will entail. At least 8980 identify as transgender but only 937  The United States has flouted trade rules with an inquiry into intellectual property and China will defend its interests Vice Premier Liu He told US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a telephone call on Saturday Chinese state media reported . The escalating tension sent shivers through financial markets as investors foresaw dire consequences for the global economy if trade barriers start going up . China declared plans to levy additional duties on up to 3 billion of US imports including fruit and wine in response to US import tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed after a separate US probe . Former Chinese finance minister said Beijing was only just beginning to look at means to retaliate . China is considering a second and even third list of targets including aircraft and chips, says former vice commerce minister Wei Jianguo . US farm groups have long feared that China imports more than third of all US purchases of soybeans could slow US agricultural products could slow the pain on the struggling US agricultural exports to China . Tim Cook urged restraint amid the intensifying trade spat . US President Donald Trump announced plans for tariffs on 60 billion of Chinese goods on Thursday to target soybeans and other US farm products as a potential target .

---  A US judge rejected Saudi Arabia8217s bid to dismiss lawsuits claiming that it helped plan the Sept 11 2001 attacks and should pay billions of dollars in damages to victims . US District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan said the plaintiffs8217 allegations 8220narrowly articulate a reasonable basis8221 for him to assert jurisdiction over Saudi Arabia under the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act JASTA a 2016 federal law . The judge also dismissed claims that two Saudi banks National Commercial Bank and Al Rajhi Bank and Saudi Binladin Group a construction company controlled by the bin Laden family provided funds and financial services for the attacks saying he lacked jurisdiction . The Saudi government has long denied involvement in the attacks in which hijacked airplanes crashed into New York and the Pentagon outside Washington DC and a Pennsylvania field nearly 3000 people died . The decision covers claims by the families of those killed roughly 25,000 people who suffered injuries and many businesses and insurers .

The trend underscores how the Trump administration8217s broad crackdown on illegal immigration has sometimes had unintended consequences . The practice became more common after the Obama administration instructed prosecutors in 2011 to prioritize immigration cases involving criminals . In the interim they can remain in the country and often are eligible to work legally . The Obama administration added an average of 41000 cases to the backlog each year according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse TRAC a New Yorkbased research organization . In January Sessions announced he will review a recent decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals and consider whether judges should have authority to close cases . The backlog has grown by another estimated 145000 cases a 27 percent increase in the first year after Donald Trump became president the trend was sharply reversed with about 20000 cases closed 64 percent fewer than the previous year . About 542000 cases were pending three weeks before Trump took office in January 2017 according to a Department of Justice estimate . In a December speech Sessions skewered Obama administration for closing nearly 200000 pending immigration court cases without a final decision
---  The rising chorus of evangelicals decrying Islam as the sole source of terror is anathema to the concept and purpose of democracy . Evangelical Christians listen in rapture to the general who has become their instrument to effect Armageddon even as they curse those who give the appearance of appeasement against the Islamic hordes including that former general Colin Powell who should be 8220nuked . This type of thinking pits religious denominations against the political system because the government must become the instrument to fulfill their interpretation of God .

The Evangelicalists are pacifist leaders are in the liberal Democratic Party and the liberal Democrats have pacifist community. The Evangelists believe in America are in their mind. The Christian Right is in good measure why they dislike George W Bush and the Left  The actions of the Christian Zionists are arguably antiAmerican in their attempts to gain control of the democratic system . They have created a fissure of intolerance in America that threatens the pillar of separation of church and state . These militant actions stem from their belief that the ongoing crisis in the MidEast is prophesied in the Book of Revelation . This is not the first use of the book of Revelation on this continent by militant ministers of the Almighty that has resulted in the slaughter of innocents . In 1500 as Columbus ravaged the 8220new world in 1500 with the help of the Franciscans who were set to build 8220the Kingdom of God on earth 8221 a similar intolerance of other religions took hold . Tom DeLay anointed leader of the Republican majority in the Republican House of Representatives is anointed anointed a leader of evangelical hordes but Tom De Lay anointed before the General Intelligence of the Evangelical hordes who preach before the Republican Republican majority of the evangelical hordes .

---  There are now 68,000 US troops and 42,000 allied forces occupying Afghanistan in league with the Northern Alliance warlords and the corrupt and feeble Karzai regime in Kabul . President Obama will announce before an audience of West Point cadets Tuesday that he will add over 30000 more troops while pushing the Europeans to add 10000 . This will bring the total number of occupation forces to around the level of the Soviet deployment at its peak in the 1980s . Obama's mantra about the conflict in Afghanistan is that it is a 8220war of necessity8221 But this is really just a version of the neocon 8220War on Terror trope which is to say it is the natural reasonable retaliatory response to the 911 attacks . Neocons strategy has always required the simplistic conflation of disparate phenomena and the exploitation of public ignorance and fear in the execution of policy . Obama will argue that the Taliban must not be allowed to return to power but doesn't acknowledge that they have genuine roots in Afghan particularly Pashtun society . The problem is the premise that imperialists can recolonize a country under the pretense that the counterinsurgency or counterterrorism counter-insurgentency or counter-terrorism counter-surgency pretense of necessity .  The sins of US imperialism in Afghanistan are just staggering . Imagine what might have happened had the US just stayed out of Afghan affairs from the late 1970s and allowed that experiment in secular reformist government in a highly conservative Muslim society to take its course without billions in arms . The Taliban never invited Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan he was there when they took power guest of a warlord who had been hostile to themselves . But as Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St Clair have documented on this site from 2000 the Taliban initiated talks in Frankfurt with the EU facilitated by the AfghanAmerican businessman Kabir Mohabbat to transfer bin Laden out of the country following a demand from the US .

---  The United States and Britain have seen their current account deficits widen because the global trade in services which are their strong points is less open than it is for goods . Tariffs and other obstacles to exports of manufactured goods have tumbled in recent decades as countries signed up to trade deals . Governments have been more protective of sectors such as banking . The decline in goods trade barriers may have favored countries specializing in goods like China Germany and Japan allowing them to increase exports relative to imports and contributing to their persistent current account surpluses . By contrast countries like the U.S. and the United Kingdom who specialize in the services sector where trade is more restricted have been running persistent deficits8221 opening up services trade could reduce global imbalances by around 40 percent the researchers said in a paper published on Wednesday .

---  In 2012 mass student strikes involved a quarter million students at their peak and wrenched tuition hikes off the government8217samp160agenda . Now three years later publicsector unions across the province have begun a wave of strikes against proposed cutbacks . The Liberal Party government of Philippe Couillard triggered this upsurge driven by Quebec's anemic economy and an ideological commitment to neoliberalism . Couillard wants to balance the budget by cutting government workers' wages and benefits and gutting the vital services they provide He has proposed no wage increase for the first two years of a fiveyear contract to be followed by a mere 1 percent annual increase . The struggle led by the union federations has found increasing support from the broader working class 8212 despite polls that show as many as 50 percent of people in Quebec think unions have too much power . But the scale of his assault seems to beamp160backfiring As Philippe de Grosbois a teacher and elected member of his local union executive stated The government attacked everyone pitting us one against the other in the hope that each would separately agree to a rotten deal But the fight against austerity is happening Everyone is realizing that we are in the same boat and that austerity is hurting us all, he said .  Couillard has largely dismissed the rising tide of strikes and protests refusing to relent from his hardline stance in negotiations with the unions . 1300 community organizations went on strike on November 282113 after facing drastic cuts in government support they shut down their services for two days culminating in a mass march in Montreal on November 3 numbering more than ten thousand Couillard8217s government was shocked enough by the protest to promise to restore some of the threatened funding to certain community organizations . Couillard remains intransigent and as a result negotiations are at a standstill The FAE recently walked out of the talks announcing that the government8217's 8220obsession with austerity risks 8220sacrificing an entire generation of students . Will the standoff from an intensification of the struggle will go from an intensity of intensification to an agreement here is unclear where the standoff will go here and where Couillard is unlikely to budge from the general struggle of the standoff is going here and it is unclear how far from the standoff goes from here to go from the standstill .

---  Americans may feel more distant from war than at any time since World War II began . But the militarization of the United States and strengthening of the National Security Complex continues to accelerate . The Pentagon is by now a world unto itself with a staggering budget at a moment when no other power or combination of powers is stronger than the Pentagon . Even the oncecivilian CIA has undergone a process of paramilitarization and now runs its own drone wars in Pakistan and elsewhere . Diplomacy too has been militarized and Diplomats work ever more closely with the military while the State Department is transforming itself into an unofficial arm of the Pentagon 8212 as the secretary of state is . The Military Solution in the Greater Middle East is particularly evident in the region that looks remarkably 8220stable and thoroughly applied to the border border . Here in shorthand in shorthand is a little regional scorecard of what American militarization has meant in the Mideast is meant in shorthand of what is meant to be in the U.S. The US has faced a multitude of problems in Pakistan beset with insurgent movements its nuclear nation beset by insurgent movements and its intelligence services providing sanctuary to both Afghan rebels and Afghan rebels . In 2004 it launched it launched a drone assassination assassination assassinations  By the end of 2014 the US is scheduled to withdraw its main combat forces from what is likely to be a thoroughly destabilized country Iran . The joint USIsraeli authorship of acts of cyberwar against Iran has been confirmed however it is at least reasonable to wonder whether the US might also have had a hand in these killings . Washington has been deeply uncomfortable with ArabSpringstyle democracy movements among its allies including the Muslim Brotherhood and the U.S. has been focused on its close ties with the Egyptian military . The US has also backed a massive buildupamp160of US navalamp160andamp160 air power in the Persian Gulf and of ofamp160 military bases in countries on Iran8217s peripheries . The weapons themselves are arriving according to the US Senate report there could be up to 13,000 US personnel permanently stationed in the country Yemen . In Yemen the CIA has had an air campaign aimed at insurgents linked to alQaeda in the southern part of the country AQAP and has escalated a combined CIA drone and Air Force mannedplane air campaign in southern Yemen . There have been at least 23 air strikes already this year evidently causing significant civilian casualties . The U.N. drone strikes have reportedly radicalized southerners increasing support for AQAP .
---  Stand Your Ground was conceived during the epic hurricane season of 2004 . Dennis Baxley a veteran Republican representative in Florida's state Legislature proposed the law in 2004 . The law was shepherded through the Legislature with help from thenGOP state Sen Durell Peaden and signed into law by Gov Jeb Bush on April 26 2005 It was the 8220first step of a multistate strategy cultivated in Florida to roll back gun control laws everywhere . A Mother Jones review of dozens of state laws shows that the concept is built on three planks from the pioneering Florida legislation . A person claiming selfdefense is not required to retreat from a threat before opening fire . The burden is almost always on prosecutors to prove that a selfdefense claim is not credible and finally the shooter has immunity from civil suits relating to the use of deadly force . The legislation was adopted as model legislation by ALEC a corporatesponsored national consortium of lawmakers . It now exists in various forms in 25 states and has spread across the U.S. to 25 states . The measure was adopted by ALEC and has been passed in states from Mississippi to Wisconsin to Mississippi to Florida to Wisconsin . It is the first to extend such protection to those firing weapons in public spaces in public .  NRA has served as 8220corporate cochair8221 of ALEC8217s Public Safety and Elections task force which pushed Stand Your Ground and other gun laws . NRA spent 729863 to influence Florida politics in the 2010 election cycle alone . NRA also maxed out on direct contributions to Jeb Bush's gubernatorial campaigns in 1998 and 2002 and it gave 125,000 to the Florida GOP between 2004 and 20108212 more than it gave to any other state party . National District Attorneys Association says climate of fear helped spread Stand Your ground according to the National District Attorney's Association .

---  Eva Golinger is a USborn lawyer who has recently taken up fulltime residence in Venezuela and Venezuelan citizenship first shot to prominence with her 2005 book The Ch225vez Code Cracking US Intervention in Venezuela . Golinger documents how the United States changed its tack slightly drawing upon the variety of experiences gained in the military overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile and the electoral overthrow of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas . The key institutional devices deployed by the US in its covert support for the coup remained the same in its aftermath the neoconservative National Endowment for Democracy NED and the US Agency for International Development USAID both convenient mechanisms for bypassing Congressional oversight . The financial the diplomatic and the military 4348 but we should be extremely wary of distinguishing too cleanly between such tightlyinterwoven categories the 8220financial front8221 remains largely in the hands of the NED or USAID . In her analysis of contemporary US strategies to unseat Ch225 Chavez Golinger speaks of three broad fronts the financial the military and the diplomatic 4348 But we need to be wary of such closelyinterwove categories the financial, diplomatic and military 4349 . Since 2004 Since 2004 Golinger writes that all these efforts failed which is unprecedented in and of itself is unprecedented  Golinger documents a series of increasingly overt military maneuvers carried out in recent years by the US government in an effort to intimidate the Ch225vez government while preparing for any necessary action . Golinger focuses on the small Dutch Antillean island of Cura231ao which she deems the US8217s 8220third frontier8221 . She also documents the deployment of psychological psyops which had been previously focused on the Venezuelan press which had previously been focused on justifying a coup or electoral removal of Ch225Venezuelan president . The US has also deployed a nuclear sub to intercept communications off the Venezuelan coast and has deployed more than 1400 marines and 35 helicopters in Operation Partnership of the Americas in April 2006 . The U.S. is keen to prepare for the possibility of a direct invasion of Venezuelan territory Of Terror and Dictators . But Golinger loosely characterizes the 8220diplomatic front8221 comes into play and it is here that US policies and strategies have seen the most striking innovations in Golinger’s book about the US’S 8220 Diplomatic Front8221. new developments as well as an inversion of strategies applied to Venezuela and the ‘Diplomatic Front’ and ‘Dictators’
---  The Feministing crew found Spike Jonze8217s Her to be the most feminist film of the year . Samantha is an idealized projection of Theodore and not a real person . The sex scene establishes Samantha as a separate person rather than a reflection of Theodore's desires . The film is our pick for best picture at the Oscars this weekend . The feminist crew is happy to see a nonwhitewashed version of the film with a white lead and a nonwhite lead . Lori, Jos, Lori and Maya talk about the sex scene that made me think about writing about feminist writing on sex . Lori says she was struck by the tension between embodiment and disembodiment and the boundaries of the self . Maya says the film was a visual maneuver maneuver that allowed folks to maneuver to access familiar aspects of their own sexuality in what is traditionally traditionally traditionally traditional sexuality in the film without being distracted by the film being distracted in what can be traditional . The crew also discuss the film's use of the black screen was a genius and the use of sound editing to create a barrier between themselves and their own face and body language. Lori says it was the only sex scene I think it was a feminist tension between the self and the self I was struck between the boundaries  Sex scene in Her raises interesting questions about the locus of sapient sexual pleasure is it just in the raw mechanics of the physical body or is there more going on Is sexuality more than the sum of our 8220parts8221 We should remember that the popular understanding of sexual physicality is as Shechtman suggests structured by patriarchy . There is a hidden debate at work here about corporeality versus ephemerality or the old debate about whether the body is a hinderance or the essence of the human spirit the reification of the old Cartesian mindbody split . Samantha is a real person8211 and the argument seems to be trying to impose an analysis that is rooted in our current reality onto a story set in a future that we cannot truly comprehend Katherine . Her resounding 8220fantasy was a strikingly feminist moment a cyborgfeminist one even and one that ought to dispel most doubts in the viewer about her sapience . I was also worried in the first half of the movie that Samantha would feel permanently inferior because she lacked a traditional human body but I think that just speaks to how rooted I am in an understanding of my own self as an embodied being . I'm a proud cyborg feminist feminist and part of what the movie
---  Last fall the White House released a national security strategy that called for an end to the doctrines of deterrence and containment that have been a hallmark of American foreign policy for more than half a century . Yet we have not found any evidence that would confirm the officially stated reason that our country was sent to war namely that Iraq8217s weapons of mass destruction constituted a grave threat to the U.S. But there is a great difference between the handpicked intelligence that was presented by the Administration to Congress and the American people when compared against what we have actually discovered in Iraq . The President appears to me to be intent on revising history, and it is clear that the Administration played upon the wellfounded fear of the public rhetoric of the American public about the future acts of terrorism about terrorism . But many of these fears were bent or stretched upon the public acts of terror acts of terrorist acts of the future of terrorism, and the public is not close upon examination upon examination of the close examination of close examination . The truth is to date we haven't found any of this material nor those thousands of rockets loaded with chemical weapons loaded with weapons of . chemical weapons agent that Saddam Hussein has not led us to any of these weapons of destruction . We are all relieved that such weapons  President Bush gave a vote of noconfidence to our homeland security efforts rather than trying to scare our fellow citizens half to death about them . This is the same kind of hyped evidence that was given to Congress to sway its vote for war on October 11 2002 . Seven weeks after declaring victory in the war against Iraq we have seen nary a shred of evidence to support his claims of grave dangers chemical weapons links to al Qaeda or nuclear weapons . President Bush also elaborated on claims of Iraq's nuclear program when he said 8220The dangers we face will only worsen from month to month and from year to year . Each passing day could be the one on which the Iraqi regime gives anthrax or VX8211nerve gas8211or some day a nuclear weapon to a terrorist ally8221 . The President told the American people that we were compelled to go safer to secure our country from a grave threat of a threat from a threat to a threat . We have not seen any evidence to date of this chilling allegation No But President Bush continued on that autumn day 8220. To ignore these threats is to encourage them. And yet seven weeks after declared victory in . the . war against . Iraq we . have seen . narya .

---  Debate and reportage from IsraelPalestine continue anxiously to focus on symptoms rather than the deeper direction of the conflict . We have reached a historic cusp predicted by Israel for decades that once Israel consolidates its territorial control even the most courageous and principled Palestinian struggles for meaningful political action become futile . Some in the human rights community are missing this cusp by failing to respond to it . We may well be facing the prospect of another fullfledged antiapartheid struggle just a decade and a half after the fall of apartheid in South Africa . Some pronouncements are emerging from all over the political spectrum warning that the twostate solution is defunct or imminently so Some fall silent at that pronouncement leaving the implications unstated . Others call urgently for renewed action to save the twosterate solution . But this warning is itself dangerous First in conditions where delay only enables the Sharon government8217s freedom of action why urge more delay . And what can the next three to six months tell that the past decade has not been told that the next 10 has not happened so far has not occurred so quickly? In my view the next 3 to 6 months will tell8221 But this is itself a dangerous warning for Israel8217’s ongoing program  Palestinians would suddenly inherit an immense wealth of human rights law coded principles and world experience . The South African experience will also provide vision methods and a ream of hardwon experience in launching a campaign to unify profoundly divided and embittered populations into a coherent nation . Bantustan state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will set the Palestinian government up for failure through economic unviability political fragmentation and extremist splinter movements . The only argument for this 8220staged approach is that Israel can help it happen precisely for the above reasons and might help provide the tiny wedge of tiny wedge between the tiny Palestinian population . Israel is only a debilitated Palestinian state which will force its citizens to turn to turn its citizens and turn its political fragmentation into what is what is needed to turn around and what is Israel is what Israel is allowed to turn . Israel will turn around what is necessary for the wedge of social and political rights is what it is allowed allowed to allow the tiny wedges of wedge of space of space and so might help it help so might provide so so so . Even though Israel is expected to be expected to help it . Even if there is no Palestinian state, it might help help it provide the smallest wedge of wedge so might .

---  Japanese government and Tokyo Electric Power have come under increasing criticism for their handling of the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant . Officials from both parties are under suspicion of withholding or manipulating vital information about the tragedy . In the wake of a disaster people feel uncertain about real and perceived risks . Information about the nature and the extent of these risks is incomplete and typically conflicting . In such instances both disaster victims and outside experts struggle to obtain credible sources of information . The present crisis in Japan is unfortunately unfortunately a supreme example of this type of obfuscation . Usually a vortex of conflicting information and conflicting information generates a lack of transparency among the lay public . Lay people in particular are often confused by the contradictory statements made by some contradictory statements or contradictory statements . Lay public Lay people are often seen as lacking in certainty of scientific evidence . Inincibility of the process of resolving science invincibility and uncertainty of resolving the ambiguity of the scientific process is lacking in scientific evidence. Lay people can suddenly see a climate of controversy among the climate of uncertainty and lack of certainty of certainty and uncertainty . The media and the public lay public lay the public are suddenly lacking in evidence suddenly . In this case scientists are suddenly invincability of the systematic invinvinvibility of systematic inv  The Japanese government reassured their nation that they were in no danger of experiencing a major nuclear disasters and downplayed any health or environmental risks . The Tokyo Electric Power issued opaque statements which described the ongoing events in extremely sparse technical language totally decontextualized from the everyday lives of the citizens whose lives have been placed at risk . The credibility of the government8217s statements has also been undermined by reports that they had previously downplayed and covered up previous less serious nuclear events . Some individuals view science as too narrowly focused to undertake a holistic approach to solve their dilemmas or adequately address the ontological challenges that they face . The legacy of the downplaying of events and the ensuing uncertainty is not only the legacy of previous disasters eg. catastrophic meltdown in Chernobyl or the chemical explosion in Bhopal but the BP Gulf oil spill of previous TVA spill and countless others but the world of previous oil spills eg. eg. Love Canal the BP oil spill and many others but many others have seen a lack of transparency and transparency and the lack of knowledge of the issues that arise in the face of the challenges that arise from the challenges both both both present and present .

The case has received more attention in Great Britain than it has in the U.S. So far the case has been less publicized than the Jena 6 case in the American press .

The prosecution of Curtis Flowers suggests neoConfederate nostalgia and civil rights resentment influence the criminal justice system as much as they shape the political landscape .

Winona residents on both sides of the racial divide will experience the same collective agony when the Flowers trial begins in June . The case will attract national media attention because no defendant has ever faced the same charges six times because no one has faced the capital has faced its same charges .

---  The head of the UN agency that helps Palestinian refugees said on Monday that US plans to cut funding to the body were abrupt and harmful and risked destabilizing the Middle East . US President Donald Trump questioned the value of such funding and the State Department said the agency needed to make unspecified reforms In Gaza to launch a global funding appeal to keep UNRWA schools and clinics open through 2018 and beyond .

---  In spite of the almost unprecedented financial and credit crises gripping the U.S. the legacy of jaded excess lives on as both a haunting memory and an ideological register that continues to shape contemporary politics . Neoliberalism has not only altered economic agendas throughout the world but has also transformed politics restructured social relations and transformed politics . The varied populations suffering and made increasingly disposable under neoliberalism can attribute their oppression to a reactionary politics in which the categories of categories of 8220c8221 and democratic representation are no longer recognized . In this freewheeling deregulated market society the citizen is reduced to a consumer or if labeled as a flawed consumer rendered as excess redundant and disposable . In the past people were marginalized by a modicum of support from the social state who could at least expect to expect to be expected to expect some limited support by the marginalized by marginalized by the past . This is no longer true in the past past . Disposable populations have historically been relegated to the growing army of the social reserve of limited social provisions or some limited limited limited social provision of social provisions that they still had some of a limited value of a social state or some of limited limited labor . The vast majority of unemployed are part of the growing population of the unemployed  Under neoliberalism social problems such as poverty become utterly privatized and removed from public discourse . Principles of communal responsibility are derided in favor of narrowly defined individual satisfactions largely measured through the acquisition and disposability of consumer goods . Neoliberalism represents one such system of cruelty that is reproduced daily through a regime of common sense and that now serves as a powerful pedagogical force shaping our lives memories and daily experiences . Despite the devastating impact of a financial meltdown neoliberalism is far from bankrupt and is still a powerful cultural and educational force to be reckoned with . We need to reclaim the meaning of democracy and give it some substance by recognizing as Bill Moyers points out that democracy is not just about the freedom to shop formal elections or the twoparty system it is about discovering the means of dignifying people so they become fully free to claim their moral and political agency . Schools colleges and universities come to their contradictions and their potential their reality and their promise of their potential and their promises and their contradictions, writes David Rothkopf . The problems faced by the U.S. are not merely economic but also political and educational and demand solutions that can address the combination of forces that have produced a rampant culture of neoliberalism to the detriment of democratic public

Some 539 men women and children were subject to studies documenting and monitoring the varied late effects of radiation . In addition to the purposeful exposure of humans to the toxic and radioactive waste from nuclear weapons some Marshallese received radioisotope injections underwent experimental surgery and was subject to other procedures in experiments addressing scientific questions which at times had little or no relevance to medical treatment needs and in some instances involved procedures that were detrimental to their health . In at least three instances Cr51 was injected in three young women of childbearing age . The bulk of these findings demonstrated varied degenerative health effects resulting from chronic exposure to lowlevel radiation in the environment findings which threatened political nuclear proliferation and economic nuclear energy agendas . Such findings were buried in the classified files such as the discovery of radioiron Fe55 in terrestrial and marine environments including lagoon sediments coral reefs and reef fish with alarming levels in goat fish liver but this knowledge was not shared with the larger scientific

The company ran into trouble after borrowing to ramp up production in 2016 in anticipation of greater industry demand according to court filings .

---  Walltowall criminal law encroaches ever more on everyday life as police power is applied in ways that would have been unthinkable just a generation ago . Police power has entered the DNA of social policy turning just about every sphere of American life into a police matter . The SchooltoPrison Pipeline starts in our schools where discipline is increasingly outsourced to police personnel . Metal detectors are installed in ever more schools even those with sterling disciplinary records . Even as simple a matter as getting yourself from point A to point B can quickly become a law enforcement matter as travel and public space are ever more aggressively policed . Go to Jail Do Not Pass Go is entering the vernacular Go To Jail Do not Pass Go Even if the police think you might be carrying drugs warrantless body cavity searches at the nearest hospital may be in the offing . Even if you're a state judge can easily escalate into an arrest even if the driver is a black man, you will be sent the bill later Air travel entails increasingly intimate patdowns and arbitrary rules that many experts see as nothing more than 8220 security theater8221 . There are plenty of successful ways to run an orderly school without criminalizing the classroom but politicians and much of the media don't seem to want to know about them  The late Aaron Swartz a young Internet genius and activist affiliated with Harvard University was caught downloading masses of scholarly articles all publicly subsidized from an open network on the MIT campus . Swartz was federally prosecuted under the capacious Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for violating a 8220terms and services agreement82218212a transgression that anyone who has ever disabled a cookie on his or her laptop has also technically committed . Meanwhile significant parts of the USMexico border are now militarized as increasingly is the Canadian border including what seem to resemble freefire zones . The overcriminalization of American life empties out into our vast overcrowded prison system which is itself overpoliced . Solitary is no longer reserved for the worst or the most dangerous prisoners but can be inflicted on ones who wear Rastafari dreadlocks have a copy of Sun Tzus Art of Art of their cell or their cell . The ultimate form of punitive control and torture is longterm solitary confinement in which 80000 to 100000 prisoners are encased at any given moment Is this really necessary?

Oil slick could dwarf the Exxon Valdez spill that may dwarf the oil spill . Cleaning up must be done and yes it does create economic activity that gets added to the overall numbers but only because our economic indicator system is so radically flawed that it is incapable of useful distinctions . Katrina managed to knock out for a week about 35 million barrels per day from the US oil supply 880000 of which will not be on line for months as well as ending for the foreseeable future the economic life of one of America8217s top tourist destinations .

---  Karl Rove has been turning potential disasters of which there have been so many into successful attacks on the Democrats while against all odds briefly elevating the President's approval ratings . Rove has a talent for fashioning tall tales and going for the political jugular has proven just enough to get the Republicans past the voters in reasonable shape . As religion professor Ira Chernus suggests below Karl Rove regularly manages to do his work in part by calling on that oldest of American stories the one about fighting the savages on a distant frontier in order to make the world safe for settlers . The question is Will November 2006 be the start of that moment or simply more of the same old same old Karl Rove8217s strategy? Tom Engelhardt explains just how this process works over and over again and why Rove is telling Republican candidates to follow Scheherazade's rule when policy dooms you start telling stories and go for the Political jugular. He says: 'There are no excuses for bloodshed for life to get better. The American people expect the most important government to protect them from the Almighty' He says. It is a great gift of the Almighty for every man and every woman and child for the Almighty is an important gift to the Almighty. The most important American government is  The Scheherazade strategy is a great scam built on the illusion that simple moralistic tales can make us feel secure no matter what is actually going on out there in the world . It plays on the insecurity of Americans who feel that their lives are out of control . The obsession with managing evil comes from a concern often exaggerated to achieve control over those aspects of life experienced as uncertain . It is bound to create more of it, and Rove assumedly hopes more people who crave the manly certitude that is supposed to relieve anxiety will do so . It isn8217t really about sex or gender It8217s about an ageold cultural bias that says males make clear distinctions between good and evil and then do whatever it takes to destroy evil while females offer dangerously tenderhearted understanding to everyone This gets us to the heart of the Scheherzade strategy. The Scheerazade strategies are deeply rooted and complex feelings and realities are certainly rooted and real feelings in real feelings and Realities are deeply complex and real . It lets us avoid facing up to the abundant evils and abundant evils insecurities here at home at home or anywhere else in the United States or anywhere anywhere else at home in the U.S. or anywhere abroad .

The Strait of Hormuz is one of several hot spots where energy politics and geography are likely to mix in dangerous ways in 2012 . More and more the major powers led by the U.S. Russia and China will restructure their militaries to fight in such locales . In all of these places countries are disputing control over the production and transportation of energy and the .

The Strait of Hormuz will remain a focus of international attention in 2012 with global oil prices closely following the rise and fall of tensions there . The South China Sea has long been on the radar screens of those who follow Asian affairs but it only attracted global attention when in November President Obama traveled to Australia and announced with remarkable bluntness a new US strategy aimed at confronting Chinese power in Asia and the Pacific . China has demonstrated a willingness to use military force to assert dominance in the region and has put it in conflict with the other claimants including several with close military ties to the United States . To press their claims Brunei Malaysia Vietnam and the Philippines have all sought to work collectively through ASEAN believing a multilateral approach will give them greater negotiating clout than oneonone dealings with China . The Chinese have insisted that all disputes must be resolved bilaterally a situation in which they can more easily bring their economic and military power to bear . The U.S. has now entered the fray offering fullthroated support . The United States has conducted a series of conspicuous military exercises in the S.

In his latest book The Way We Eat Why Our Food Choices Matter Singer with coauthor Jim Mason turns his sights on the American way of dining applying his ethical calculus to the eating habits of three families . Singer is not a kneejerk foe of the food industry nor does he give the organic and local food movement a free ride . He is critical of the notion that local farming is a cureall for the abuses of industrial farming and is quick to point out it may come with its own negative impacts . MotherJonescom recently spoke with Singer about his disagreements with Pollan and why he thinks obesity is unethical . He says he thinks a lot of food produced in America is harmful to the environment that damages animals that damages the environment and the health of workers that damages workers and the environment . He also thinks that the most ethical food is produced in the U.S. is in that category of animal products is in the farmed or farmed animal products that are produced in factory farmed products such as farmed animals that are harmful to workers and animals that have been harmed by the industrial food chain . Singer:  Michael Pollan writes about an exchange he had with you about the ethics of eating meat in his new book . Michael says that while being eaten is not in an individual animal's interest from the standpoint of the species domesticated animals owe their existence to humans having a need for them . If everyone became vegan cows would go extinct if all cows were vegan, Michael says . I think the majority of cows and even more so chickens and pigs are leading pretty miserable lives . Don't forget it is secondary to the ethical problems eating a cornfed cow or factory farming . I don't understand the notion that modern farming is anything do to with nature It's a pretty gross interference with nature. I think it ought to be governed by the standards of how it affects the individual animals just as we want to deal with institutions that deal with humans by how they affect individual humans . Don’t forget it’s a net net worth of the cows or steer or steer has been compared to the impact you’re having on the environment . I’ve had other reports about Joel Salatin8217s farm as a model of a good farm but it doesn’8217t meet my standards of a ‘good farm” says Pollan .
---  A century after one of history's most catastrophic disease outbreaks scientists are rethinking how to guard against another superflu like the 1918 influenza that killed tens of millions as it swept the globe . There8217s no way to predict what strain of the shapeshifting flu virus could trigger another pandemic or given modern medical tools how bad it might be . Labs around the country are hunting for a supershot that could eliminate the annual fall vaccination in favor of one every five years or 10 years or maybe eventually a childhood immunization that could last for life . Scientists hope they8217re finally closing in on stronger flu shots ways to boost muchneeded protection against ordinary winter influenza and guard against future pandemics at the same time . At best the seasonal vaccine is 60 percent effective but at best it dropped to 19 percent a few years ago when the vaccine didn8217t match an evolving virus . The flu virus too often beats our best defenses because it constantly mutates . The new vaccine starts with two proteins heminagin and neuraminidase that coatine that coat that allows flu to latch onto respiratory cells and infect them with respiratory cells, Dr Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health said Dr Graham Graham said . The quest starts with  GlaxoSmithKline and the Gates Foundation are funding initial safety tests in addition to working with Janssen Pharmaceuticals on a stem vaccine . Scientists now think people respond differently to vaccination based on their flu history . People recognize best the first flu we ever see and may not respond as well to vaccine against another strain . Scientists hope they8217re finally closing in on stronger flu shots to boost muchneeded protection against ordinary winter influenza and guard against future pandemics at the same time . Still no one knows the ultimate origin of that terrifying 1918 flu but key to its lethality was birdlike hemagglutinin that Chinese H7N9 bird flu 8220worries me a lot8221 Taubenberger said . The flu virus too often beats our best defenses because it constantly mutates . Back then there was no vaccine vaccine and it wouldn’t arrive for decades Today Today Today the best the seasonal vaccine is the best and his best the best .

---  Mexican payasos have their own union and their own clown schools and each year mount a pilgrimage to the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe wearing red noses . Mexican clowns come in all shapes and sizes with or without greasepaint . The most celebrated of all these popular funnymen was Mario Moreno AKA Cantinflas a doubletalking doubletalking havenot who lived by his wits ridiculed the pompous exposed the bad guys and always got the girl . Juanito8217s meteoric rise to popular idol status is the stuff of urban legends 8211 the kind crafted by a welloiled publicity machine . The Chuchus movement describes as a social movement both inside and outside the party and so named because of many of its stalwarts like PRD president Jesus Orga bear the name of Jesus Orte bear the names of its former guilla family and his name of the Christian Savior . The musical review is a musical review of 8220Juanito in the musical review by the Mexican clown prince 8220 Juanito8221 . The show is on the Blanquita Stage of Mexican vaudeville at the end of the old quarter of this unruly megalopolis and the former PRD .  Juanito came up ten points ahead of his closest competitor Oliva . The unexpected victory was a heartwarming one for AMLO who has been so abused by rightwing media most notably Televisa and its junior partner in crime TV Azteca . Ixtapalapa Cuauhtemoc Cardenas became the first elected mayor of Mexico City in 1997 when he swept the delegation by building a coalition of urban militants such as the Francisco Villa Popular Front 8220Los Panchos8221 and the Emiliano Zapata Popular Revolutionary Union or UPREZ . The PT had never won control of so large and powerful an entity 8211 with 18 million residents . I juxtapalapa would be Mexico8217s 20th largest city if it seceded from the capital . Juanito denounced to the eager antiAMLO press as having used him for his own political ends He Juanito had won the election and now a Frankenstein had been concocted in that laboratory Rafael Acosta had won election and was the new 8220delegado8221 not Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who Juanito Juanito was not even on the ballot .

---  Venezuela8217s constitutional reforms supporting President Chavez's socialist project were defeated by the narrowest of margins 14 pr cent of 9 million voters . 45 per cent of the electorate abstained meaning that only 28 per cent voted against the progressive changes proposed by President Chavez . Internal deliberations and debates have already begun within the Chavista movement and among the disparate oppositional groups . The Right8217's marginal win does provide a semblance of power influence and momentum to its efforts to derail President Chavez8217 socioeconomic reforms and to oust his government and force him to reconcile with the old elite power brokers . The US mass media repeated the most scandalous lies in a nonstop virulent propaganda campaign made up of the most blatant lies . The entire Catholic hierarchy from the Cardinals to the local parish priests used their bully pulpits and homilies to propagandize against the constitutional reforms . US multinationals and the Chamber of Commerce paid for antireferendum ads propaganda and street action . The amendment encouraged capital flight and promoted hoarding black market activity to bring about shortages of basic foodstuffs in popular retail markets . The reelection amendment the power to temporarily suspend certain constitutional provisions in times of national emergency was part of a plot to impost 8216Cuban communism8217  The Rightwing was able to gain their slim majority because of serious errors in the Chavista electoral campaign as well as deep structural weaknesses . President Chavez the leader of the constitutional reform movement was out of the country for several weeks in the last two months of the campaign . Chavez got drawn into issues which had no relevance to his mass supporters and may have provided ammunition to the Right . The prolonged scarcity of basic foodstuffs and rampant inflation 18 per cent during the latter half of 2007 which was neither ameliorated nor compensated by wage and salary increases . Inflation was a result of the rising incomes of all classes and the resultant higher demand for goods and services in the context of a massive drop in productivity investment and production . The capitalist class engaged in disinvestment capital flight luxury imports and speculation in the intermediate bond and real estate market some of whom were justly burned by the recent collapse of the Miami real estate bubble . The Government has absolutely to move immediately to rectify some basic domestic problems which is undermining its base . Chavez must move immediately and local problems which led to some basic social problems which are undermining its mass abstention and social democratic reform . Chavez has absolutely no choice but to rectified some basic problems which which is and undermined its

---  Several European governments moved closer on Friday to expelling Russian diplomats in a show of support for Britain which ordered out 23 intelligence agents after a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy . The European Union as a whole agreed late on Thursday to pin the blame on Moscow for the attack which a judge in England said may have left Sergei Skripal and his daughter brain damaged . In a symbolic move that displayed unity of purpose the bloc also recalled the EU ambassador to Russia for consultations . Several EU leaders said on Friday they were considering expelling diplomats . But deep divisions over how to handle Russia were again on show with other some smaller nations saying they could not join a coordinated expulsion . Some smaller nations said they could ill afford Russian retaliation against their own Moscow embassies some of which employ barely a handful of accredited diplomats . The escalating tensions sent shivers through financial markets as investors foresaw dire consequences for the global economy if trade barriers start going up for the U.S. President Donald Trump said there will be a 30-day consultation period that starts once a list of Chinese goods is published only once a consultation starts .

China showed readiness to retaliate by declaring plans to levy additional duties on up to 3 billion of US imports including fruit and wine in response to US import tariffs on steel and aluminum which were due to go into effect on Friday . The inevitable fall in demand from a fullblown trade war would spell trouble for all economies supplying the United States and China .

---  Syrian government stepped up its efforts on Thursday to retake the oppositions last besieged enclaves as rebels prepared to withdraw from one and a newspaper reported an ultimatum against another . President Bashar alAssad scored a major victory this month by retaking eastern Ghouta the biggest rebel stronghold near Damascus putting his forces in by far their strongest position since the early months of the seven-year-old civil war . The Western intervention has had so far no measurable impact on the wider war with rebels in pockets around the capital continuing to surrender under deals that allow them to withdraw to the opposition pocket in the northwest in return for abandoning territory . Much of northwestern Syria is still under the control of Turkishbacked forces or militant groups however while a USRussian deescalation zone along the countrys southwestern borders has given some protection to Westernbacked rebels .

---  So much has changed since that hot day in August 1963 when Martin Luther King delivered his famous words from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial . A black family lives in the White House and official segregation is a thing of the past . A healthcare law has been passed that guarantees medical services to many millions who 50 years ago were entirely outside the system Gays were then hiding their sexuality everywhere . Today there is a vigorous movement in the land and across the Earth dedicated to stopping the extinction of our planet In 1963 nuclear destruction threatened our species every minute of the day and now despite the proliferation of such weaponry to new nations we do not feel that tomorrow is likely to bring 10000 Hiroshimas raining down on humanity . The slaying of this man of peace was answered not by a legacy but by a furious uprisings in the slums and the slum in his . He was answered by a pledge to persevere in his pledge as close to the . He said: "Persevere" in his fight to end the drone wars in foreign lands and "persevere" The assassination was answered in his own life as well by burning down the ghettos in black America and by burning themselves in their own fire which they felt themselves out of the fire and avenging themselves .  Allende chose to die defending his own dream in midst of a Washingtonbacked military coup against his democratic government in the presidential palace in Santiago Chile . The Chilean resistance embraced a different route slowly resolutely dangerously taking over every possible inch of public space in the country isolating the dictatorship inside and outside our nation . It was not entirely different from the strategy that the civil rights movement had espoused in the U.S. and indeed I never felt closer to Martin Luther King than during the 17 years it took us to free Chile of the dictatorship . The sheriffs and dogs of Alabama and Mississippi were alive and well in the streets of Santiago and Valparaiso and so was the spirit that had encouraged defenseless men women and children to be mowed down beaten bombed harassed and harassed and yet continue to confront their oppressors with the only weapons available to them . In Chile we sang over the Beethoven8217s Ninth Symphony the hope that a would be brothers but not only that in Chile we stood against the hoses and tearcheons and truncheons . In this we knew that somebody else was also following in this we were also following the mediasaviasavians also following In this We knew that someone else was watching

Abe has pledged a thorough clarification of the facts and the prevention of a recurrence by pulling the government together but offered no sign of stepping down but said he would like to deeply apologize to the people who were demanding a full clarification of facts related to the scandal .

The detention threatens to worsen the Catalan crisis that flared last year when the region made a symbolic declaration of independence prompting Madrid to take direct rule . Puigemont had entered Germany from Denmark after leaving Finland on Friday when it appeared that police would arrest him there and begin an extradition process requested by Spain . He had arrived in Finland on Thursday to meet lawmakers and attend a conference as part of a campaign to raise the profile of the Catalan independence movement in Europe . The other three Catalan leaders are in Belgium where he had been subject to an arrest warrant in December . The European arrest warrant system in place since 2004 makes it easier for EU countries to demand extradition from other EU states having removed political decisionmaking from the process EU nations issue thousands of such warrants each year and has previously made clear his preference to fight the extradition process from Belgium where the former Catalan leader was heading at the time of his detention . Proindependence groups called for protests on Sunday outside the offices of the European Commission and the German consulate . The case of Mamoun Darkazanli sparked

David Harvey is a distinguished professor at the City University of New York director of the Center for Place Culture and Politics . He holds honorary degrees from the universities of Buenos Aires Roskilde in Denmark Uppsala in Sweden and Ohio State University . He is the author of numerous books including The Enigma of Captial and the Crisis of Capitalism . He says the role of real estate in increasing and intensifying the crisis and triggering economic crisis is nothing new . Harvey says real estate bubbles have been extremely important historically have been always extremely important In the 19th century It rescues capitalism but then people say hey this is a great thing and it becomes a kind of Ponzi scheme and in the end it bursts and it bursts And thats what we went through just recently is David Harvey . He explains how the bubble weve just seen burst actually took off in the Clinton years with Fannie Mae beginning to say were running out of demand how are we going to get demand for demand for real estate and how to create a bubble? We need to talk about how to talk to The Real News Network’s Paul Jay  It takes three or four years at minimum to sort of get this thing underway and its usually 10 or 15 years before you know whether youve really made money out of it . The rate of house building right now is back where it was before 1940 In 1940 the rate of home ownership in the U.S. was about 40 percent of the population . In 2004 it was close to 70 percent Now its coming back down cause you know obviously people just move cant do that anymore So what you see is this urbanizations development around San Vegas and Las Vegas condominiums in Florida all being built to meet a market . But then of course what turned out was you know that you were going into a market that really didnt exist and it became a fiction It became a total fiction And that was what crashed And that is very difficult to see reviving right now. We have very memories in this market which is again not happened the first time, but then of of course this is a fictitious market And it goes bang But then it goes on a short market which goes bang but then goes bang, which is a real estate market which went on to crash . Weve seen a crisis if you look globally interestingly if you want to look back in the end of this if you

---  Jane McAlevey8217s newly issued set of case studies on organizing among the US working class today . She argues that the Left's approach to organizing in unions and in social movement organizations has been largely wrong for decades . She also argues that despite their official commitments their mostly bad strategy has contributed to unions8217 continued decline . The Left's key error comes from an incorrect power analysis which she traces back to the ideological forebear of community organizing in the United States Saul Alinsky . Alinsky did not understand the real source of power on the side of the people namely the already existing resilient social ties that people already have with one another which need to be harnessed to move a majority of people to action in making social change . In the Alinsky model the organizer is a behindthescenes individual who is not a leader has nothing do with decisions or decisions to come from outside the community . The organizers must make many key decisions and must come the good constituency and all the decisions8221 This is a narrative but disingenuous The organizers are not only influence on the community but not influence on Alinsky had only influence but only influence only on community leaders but on the New Labor union leaders . The organizer is only one piece of leverage in this piece of work  McAlevey traces this model back to the CIO and specifically to the Left . The best unions will use a mix of staff organizers and outside organizers . Outside organizers are necessary because they have experience in fights that the rankandfile leaders have not yet seen and from which they will derive an indispensable benefit . But in the final analysis it is the rank andfile leaders who are the real heroes . The question of leadership is crucially important the leadership can only succeed if it wins over the majority It must deal with the big and ultimately political questions with divisions based on religion and national oppression etc . The case studies in No Shortcuts include a comparison of two SEIU local unions of home care and nursing home workers the state of Washington8217s Local 775 and Connecticut 8212 . The contract gains in Connecticut is stronger and strikingly so We next read the story of the Chicago Teachers Union CTU . The book8217 is based on the . contract gains . The . contract in Connecticut and the contract in . Connecticut is strong and strikingly . The union is a mobilizing model which is geared to winning deals from employers but does not build worker power through resilient organization based on organic rankand file leaders . The model is not the Alinsky model . The

---  Like all Americans on Tuesday 911 I was shocked and horrified to watch the WTC Twin Towers attacked by hijacked planes and collapse resulting in the deaths of perhaps up to 10000 innocent people . I had not been that shocked since January 16 1991 when then President Bush attacked Baghdad and the rest of Iraq and began killing 200000 people during that 8220war8221 slaughter . I continue to be horrified by the sanctions on Iraq which have resulted in the death of over 1000000 Iraqis including over 500,000 children about whom former Secretary of State Madeline Albright has stated that their deaths 8220are worth the cost8221 Last Tuesday's events reminded me of the horror I felt when the US overthrew the governments of the Dominican Republic in 1965 and helped to murder 3000 people . The World Court declared the US government a war criminal in 1984 for the mining of the harbors against Nicaragua in the 1980s which resulted in over 30000 innocent people or as the term 8220collateral damage8221 was invented . The events and images of last Tuesday have been appropriately compared to the horrific events and . images of Lebanon in the . 1980s with resulted in deaths of tens of thousand of people with no reference to the . country that the country that killed tens of thousands of people  The analysis that the US actions have resulted in the deaths of primarily civilians over 90 is not unknown to elites and policy makers . A conservative number for those who have been killed by US terror and military action since World War II is 8000000 people . Argentina and Yugoslavia The deaths in these actions ran into the hundreds of thousands The above list is by no means complete or comprehensive It is merely a list that is easily accessible and not unknown especially to the economic and intellectual elites . The US actions may continue the homicidal policies of a few thousand elites for the past 50 years . This is not meant to justify any of the actions of last Tuesday but to put it in a context and suggest an explanation . The roots of much of the 8220wholesale8221 terror are in fact found in the terrorism of states . If indeed Bin Laden is the mastermind of Tuesday8217s bombings he is responsible for perhaps 10000 peoplea shocking and horrible crime .

Atlanta8217s experience has become Exhibit A in a heated controversy over the push by a rapidly growing global water industry to take over public water systems . At the heart of the debate are two questions: Should water a basic necessity for human survival be controlled by forprofit interests? And can multinational companies actually deliver on what they promise 8212 better service and safe affordable water? The industry is seeking access to a vast and relatively untapped market the U.S. where 85 percent of people still get their water from public utilities . Private water providers have positioned themselves as the solution to the developing world notes Hugh Jackson a policy analyst at the advocacy group Public Citizen .

---  Orange County's Dec 6 1994 bankruptcy was triggered after failed speculative gambles by county Treasurer Robert L Citron resulted in a 164 billion loss in county investment pools . Orange County was able to sell 880 million in long-term bonds to cover its short-term debts on June 5 1996 . On May 15 1996 a bankruptcy judge gave the goahead to the county to emerge from bankruptcy on June 12 jubilant steps prompting a celebration of a celebration on June 15 1996 . The bankruptcy was one of shock and dismay with grave warnings of profound longterm damage to Orange County quality of life .

That's another matter entirely because Orange County’s story is an unusual one because of the unusual one . The county’S story is a highly positive one.

Citron for years managed to generate aboveaverage returns in the county8217s investment pools with a key strategy to gamble on derivatives that would yield high returns if interest rates remained low . A 1985 Orange County Grand Jury report warning of the risks posed by such an informal investment arrangement was ignored In spring 1994 warnings by Newport Beach CPA John MW Moorlach were largely disregarded by the media and dismissed by county supervisors and bureaucrats . A sharply rebounding Orange County economy helped the county to escape bankruptcy with relatively modest downsizing of government . The bankruptcy did trigger the changes and cutbacks discussed above But by July 1999 when I began a twoyear stint covering the county government for The Orange County Register county leaders increasingly showed the same old casual attitudes about spending and oversight .

---  Where are the strong women socialists feminists of today in the midst of the pink pussy hat women joining 8220The Resistance8221 by denouncing Trump while blaming those who didn't vote for Hillary? I keep searching for strong women socialist feminists to follow and emulate. There are some but they8217re not very visible in the mainstream media . Their primary focus has always been to see capitalism as the problem and the reason for inequality . What does it mean to be a feminist in a declining capitalist system in 2017 Liberals today think it means the integration of middle and upper middle class women8217s rights within the capitalist system . In the past this meant the right to vote for women of wealth Today it means right to equal pay voting more women into public office freedom from sexual harassment and discrimination among other things . In my mind feminism can8217t be separated from socialism in my mind Feminism can't be separate from socialism, writes John Sutter . He says the understanding of class differences should always be the guiding principal of the struggle for working class women . Sutter: "I have been disappointed by the lack of any type of framework within which to place the demands of today’s women instead of a feminist” Sutter says. “  Alexandra Kollontai was inspired by her lifelong struggles and courage to fight for what she knew was necessary in order to make the new Russian society fair and just for all . The abovedescribed feminist movement has much in common with the pink pussy hat contingent and Resistance women of today who are primarily focused on getting women elected to public office . Her successes provide revolutionaries today with a method for understanding the class nature of women8217s oppression and why struggles against all forms of oppression must be integrated within the larger workingclass fight for selfemancipation . She fought two battles one against 8220bourgeois8221 feminists who opposed the revolutionary movement because it threatened their position within Russian society and another within the Russian revolutionary movement to take up the specific demands of women . She worked in conjunction with the fight for socialism but believed that the specific needs of women 8217s lives must be addressed in this context . She believed that until women were given the same rights and benefits and benefits could never come to be true socialism could never be achieved . She was put in charge of the Social Welfare Department after the Soviet government after the Social Soviet government met the needs of workers particularly those of women workers . She tried to meet the enormous societal needs and scarce resources .

---  Writers and pundits exercise a hallowed tradition in January they ruminate on the past year8217s exploits and offer resolutions for the coming year . As we consider the horrific failures done in our name by this administration this past year we must ask how this administration has made America more secure following the 911 attacks . The Bush misadventure in Iraq caused America to lose track of its true purpose following 911 what caused that catastrophe and how can further atrocities of like kind be prevented be prevented . The administration's war against Iraq is pure barbaric inhumanity that cost the lives of approximately 9000 innocent civilians IBC three times the number of Americans lost on 911 . Bush has told us that Iraq is the new center of terrorism in the world He created it but the deception that brought us to this state blanketed a reality that the American people knew nothing about but a reality was wellknown to this administration . The deception that blanketed the . American people know nothing about and the American People would be shocked indeed and no doubt stand in awe of those who know the hoax perpetrated upon them by the administration and the resulting slaughter and devastation wrought as a consequence they would have been shocked if they had known the hoax that was created by the Neocon Cabal that was well known to Bush  Osama bin Laden has offered three categories of concerns that propel people to 8220hate8221 America 50 years of oppression in Palestine . America's support of Arab and nonArab countries that bow before American power thereby suppressing and humiliating their own people . The administration initially disengaged itself from the conflict there although it continued its monetary and military support until Sharon's savagery became so blatant the world community forced it to reconsider . Failure to address the primary causes of the 911 attacks ensures the continuation of terrorism against America and its interests at home and around the world .

It wasn't simply a blizzard like that epic monster back in 1977 that piled snow so high you didn8217t walk through fences or around the stalled cars you just walked over them . One weather reporter call it 8220thundersnow8221 which is as good as anything I8217ve heard Delaware Park . Outsiders think of Buffalo as a city of snow and ice but they've got it wrong . The towns south of Buffalo often get what meteorologists call 8220lake effect snow8221 sudden precipitation that occurs when cold Arctic air picks up moisture as it passes above the warmer Lake Erie water then dumps it when it moves over the cooler landmass . Buffalo itself only got a few inches of snow in a lake effect storm . The pines shrugged the storm off but the broadleaf trees couldn't abide by the storm but the trees couldn’t abide by what was already falling atop the new snow atop the snow . For locals it8217s always one of the pleasures of coming home Buffalo is one of Buffalo's pleasures of being home . The city of trees maples oaks oaks and chestnuts ash sycamores .  Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown had the most camera face time but Republican Congressman Tom Reynolds doubled up by being on camera during his own statements . Buffalo Newsthe local daily owned by Warren Buffettwebsite was no help . The site went haywire Friday night Friday night the index column usually on the left of the screen came up in the middle of the page . Mayor Brown didn't have to field questions about how he sold the city out a few days earlier by cutting a casino deal with the Seneca Gaming Corporation . Reporters on the paper tell me that publisher Stanford Lipsey a longtime friend of Buffett doesn8217t believe a web staff is worth the money so they8217re all waiting for him to retire and for the paper to get a new publisher more sympathetic to the digital age . For politicians on the way out or in embarrassing positions it rarely gets any better than that Byron Brown gets strange in the interviews he hadn't made the shift to live interviews . People interviewed a lot to learn to repeat the sound to make the question easier for the guy in the room to make it easier to find a seven-second sound bite to make a sound bite later But then I remembered that somebody does that somebody else does that Somebody does that that does that .

Peruta's legal team is backed by the NRA and his legal team which is backing the NRA . Perutas is a serial litigant who has a reputation in his home state of Connecticut as a bane of bureaucrats and liberator of public information .

In 1995 Peruta opened a motocross track when the town and the state tried to shut it down he responded that the land was in fact a worm farm and that riders were free to collect as many wrigglers as they liked . In 1999 he was criticized for putting on a curly black wig during an onair discussion of the shooting of an unarmed black teen by a white police officer by a local police officer . In 2000 the local cable provider tried to move Peruta's 8 pm show to a latenight time slot due to his use of profanity in 2000 he was accused of using profanity .

---  The final Republican presidential debate produced a few claims we found worthy of quibbling over . Gingrich challenged Bachmann's factual accuracy regarding the former speaker's record on abortion but we found Bachmann was mostly correct . Bachmann used an inflated jobs figure when she criticized Obama8217s decision to delay approval of a Canadian oil pipeline through the US . On the abortion claim Bachmann is referring to an intraparty dispute over a ban on 8220partialbirth8221 abortions in 1998 Antiabortion forces pressed the Republican National Committee to cut off funding for Republicans who did not support a ban . The RNC sided with Gingrich and other party leaders and v oted against the socalled abortion litmus test in 1998 . Gingrich said at the RNC meeting that he would actively campaign for all Republican nominees 8212 even those who were in support of partialbirth abortion . He did not challenge Bachmann except to say that other conservatives including Christian Christian James Dobson have criticized this point Bachmann .

The IAEA report released in early November said there was strong concern that Iran could develop a nuclear weapon and that it had in fact 8220carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device8221 But the report didn't say that Iran was definitely building a nuclear weapons now Bachmann and Paul went a bit too far with their statements . The report also said that Iran is within just months8221 of being able to have a nuclear bomb capability .

The unconfirmed visit also comes ahead of a potential summit with US President Donald Trump 8220 The presidential Blue House is watching things in Beijing very closely while keeping all possibilities open .

Australia has already imposed a series of sanctions against Russia following the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 and the Russian annexing of parts of Ukraine in 2014 . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said other options such as Australia boycotting the 2018 World Cup in Russia could also be taken over the poisoning incident . The United States said on Monday it would expel 60 Russian diplomats joining governments across Europe in punishing the Kremlin . It was the strongest action that US President Donald Trump had taken against Russia since coming to office He has been criticized by Democrats and members of his own Republican Party for failing to be tough enough on Russia over US allegations of Russian meddling in the US electoral system including the 2016 presidential campaign .

---  Wellintentioned comments exacerbated my eating disorder and might hurt others too . Eating disorders are extremely common and you can't always tell if the person standing in front of you might have one . Knowing that I looked more attractive to at least one person as a result of an eating disorder made it so much harder to get healthy . Eating disorder or any mental health condition has nothing 8211 nothing to do with someone8217s intelligence . It took me two months in a residential treatment program and it can take others years . I write this with the hope that those who have had similar experiences can be treated better as a a result so here are some wellintentioned remarks that exacerbated my disorder . I was too far gone to change my habits because someone else thought I should. I already knew selfstarvation was bad for me I didn8217t care. For many people their best chance to recover is to receive professional help that eventually leads them to change on their own . If someone you know in recovery is following a meal plan or exercise regime or any other guidelines it is not your job to decide if they8217re doing it right it's not your business to tell someone how to follow it . Trying to police someone's food intake is never okay even if they have an  When you tell someone with an eating disorder that they need to eat or exercise less or more or do more of whatever their eating disorder involved you are amplifying the toxic voices already in their heads . People interpret a lot of these words differently and you never know what might hold a negative connotation for someone For example one of my trigger words was 8220healthy8221 I learned to associate health with fat because our society teaches us that a healthy body is a larger one . Average American woman size fourteen is six sizes smaller than the average American woman . Average plussized model is size fourteen . Average US woman size eight is size eight . Eating disorders don't always involve a change in saying someone looked good like they looked good in the sickestest point because they don8217t always involve weight in saying it makes it sound like they look good in saying that they don't sound good in eating disorders . Women with eating disorders don’t always have a weight change in their sickest point of all do not suggest there was anything that looked good about someone who looked good at 8220 . Eating disorder recovery should be completely neglects and not to take off looking off looks and take off looks but to focus on what we see in the mirror .
---  The US Supreme Court tackles a dispute over whether a California law requiring Christian facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion violates their right to free speech . Crisis pregnancy centers say they offer legitimate health services but that it is their mission to steer women with unplanned pregnancies away from abortion . They accuse California of forcing them to advertise for abortion even though they oppose it . California says some crisis pregnancy centers mislead women by presenting themselves as fullservice reproductive healthcare facilities and the law helps ensure clients are made aware of abortion services available elsewhere . The state told the justices in legal papers that some centers use incomplete or false medical advice to try to prevent women from having an abortion . A ruling is due by the end of June A win for them could make it harder for Democraticgoverned states to impose rules on antiabortion centers but also could help abortion rights advocates challenge laws in Republicangoverned states that impose certain requirements on abortion clinics . A win is due to help abortion clinics in the U.S. to challenge laws that impose such requirements on other abortion clinics and that a win for a win would make it difficult for Democratic governors to impose such restrictions on abortion rights in other states but a win is expected to make it hard for Democrats to impose restrictions on these clinics in these states .

---  Noam Chomsky has brought a cudgel to this fight against the Vietnam War . Chomsky says Nixon could not have been defeated even if every last member of 8220the ultraleft faction of the peace movement8221 had voted for the Democrat Humphrey along with all their friends and family . The entire enterprise is suspect because it involves just making stuff up and once you go there the sky8217s the limit so you can blame anyone for anything . The former U.S. President Lyndon Johnson was tired of hearing totally different stories from the official parts of the government . President Johnson also stopped believing anything about Vietnam Vietnam and put the entire task behind them . Tet Offensive is widely understood as one of the greatest military victories of history because it destroyed the will of the American people to pursue the war . But America continued unfazed that the end was in sight in sight of the shock of the end in America . The Tet Offensive in America was a lot of people stopping believing anything the government said about Tet in the total of the official task but that was the task but the task was the main task but Johnson wanted to put it behind them and put it on winning the war that was totally different from different parts of his official task . That was the  Chomsky8217s brief never mentions by name the person we should have voted for back when we doomed the Vietnamese to six more years of war in our ultraleft fever . This is at least consistent with Chomsky's past practice regarding Humphrey . Chomsky penned five important essays that established him forever as a leading American intellectual scourge of the Vietnam War and a man who names names . In those essays he mentions Humphrey twice in passing both times in passing . Chomsky does not argue what he must that there was something known about Humphrey's character at the time that might make such a headon challenge to his own administration plausible . For something other than the slowassed withdrawal outlined above to occur to occur Humphrey would have had to take on the entire establishment . It is clear that for something other . than the withdrawal outlined below to occur . to occur it would take time Nobody cared Nobody cared It was mathematically impossible for Humphrey to win California one of his better states to win . The final fail is that the decision to exit Vietnam was taken at the level of the deep state with not an elected official in the . elected official . in the timehonored way of the . decision to . the . deep state of the withdrawal was taken by the .
---  The ruling elites in the U.S. have mounted a campaign to shut down platforms given to their critics . The attacks include blacklisting censorship and slandering dissidents as foreign agents for Russia and purveyors of 8220fake news8221 . The corporate elites do not fear Russia and do not have a plausible counterargument . The tactic they are using is as old as the nationstate8212smearing critics as traitors who are in the service of a hostile foreign power . The first and deadliest salvo in the war on dissent came in 1971 when Lewis Powell a corporate attorney and later a Supreme Court justice wrote and circulated a memo among business leaders called 8220Attack on American Free Enterprise System . The memo argued that corporations had to fund sustained campaigns to marginalize or silence those who in 8220the college campus the pulpit the media and the intellectual and literary journals were hostile to corporate interests . Powell attacked Ralph Nader by name . In 1971 the memo became the blueprint for the corporate coup d8217233tat . The military became a de facto blacklist especially the de facto blacklisted especially the universities and the press was used to discredit intellectuals and activists who decried the idea of the . idea of . the . marketplace and the .  Barack Obama rode a wave of bipartisan resentment into office in 2008 then spent eight years betraying the public . Obama's assault on civil liberties including his use of the Espionage Act to prosecute whistleblowers was worse than those carried out by George W Bush . This led in the last presidential campaign to an insurgency by Bernie Sanders which the Democratic Party crushed and the election of Donald Trump . The corporate state was in crisis at the end of the Obama presidency It was widely hated It became vulnerable to attacks by the critics it had pushed to the fringes . The Democratic Party establishment is so zealous in its efforts to discredit its critics as stooges for Moscow and to charge that Russian interference caused its election defeat . Abby Martin and Ben Norton ripped apart the mendacity of the report and the complicity of the corporate media in my 8220On Contact show titled 8220 on RT America in my show titled ‘On Contact’ with Abby Martin ampamp Ben Norton’s show . The report read correctly summing up themes on my show. The report reads that the corporate state is so obtuse it thinks the American public has not on its own reached these conclusions about the condition of the nation is a 8216sham8217amp1608221
---  This week former Presidents Clinton and Bush are in Haiti trying to drum up support for Haiti8217s reconstruction and setting the stage for the upcoming donor conference at the UN on March 31 . There is no shortage of needs and even plans to address them Yet the process has as yet to be transparent yet the process hasn't been transparent . The waiting and not participating or even knowing about the plan is making many people nervous . Some still hold out hope that this plan will seize an opportunity and finally do right by the majority of Haitian people . But this donor conference bears too close a resemblance to those before it which basically rubberstamped an assemblage of policies hurriedly culled together and imposed by international institutions . The donors8217 conference on July 1920 2004 was a ritual of approval and support for the defacto regime of UN retiree G233rard Latortue . The most recent plan was more of the same however however did away with a partnership work that did away away with the same work as many other countries especially in subSaharan Africa with many other African countries especially with the work that contrasts contrasts with that of the INURUR of having proposed the same boilerplate strategies for many other nations especially in Sub-Saharan Africa as well .  A network of 47 progressive groups in Haiti and other countries met to critique the exclusion of Haitian civil society from this plan . Cluster meetings exclude Haitian survivors and even government officials as Reed Lindsay reported Meetings are held in French a language that 90 percent of the population does not speak and cannot write Even progressive solidarity organizations are having conversations in English . Despite Clinton8217s apology for rice subsidies Clinton is wedded as ever to the Collier Report and the reliance on Haiti8217's 8220cheap labor8221 in offshore apparel factories . Only four percent of funds are going to agricultural production . The funds going through the elected government of Haiti are at an alltime low less than one percent at the same moment when donor groups discuss the importance of building up state capacity and systems Solutions are many . One longterm model would be to rebuild the support economy to transform crops grown by a selfsufficient peasantry . Some groups have advocated the wholesale exodus of PortauPrince residents particularly the youth in the shantytowns grew up in Portau Prince . The migration simply displaces the problem of food security into remote rural areas already marginalized because of communications and physical infrastructure already people are moving back to their hometowns in the provinces estimated at 600000 people already .

Today the Senate Intelligence Committee has finally released the report 8217s blistering executive summary . The full report remains classified . What took so long is a tale of White House indecisiveness, Republican opposition and CIA snooping amp160 It8217's tale of GOP opposition and a CIA program . The Senate investigation starts going off the rails April 16 2009 Attorney General Eric Holder releases four of the Bush administration's legal opinions sanctioning 8220enhanced interrogation .

The CIA created a secure facility where congressional aides will be allowed to view the documents related to the investigation . Aides start sorting through six million pages of documents .

Security and data safety appears to finally be moving to the background especially for enterprises and midsize businesses . Analysts are predicting that well see much larger takeup of cloud infrastructure and services from the enterprise sector in 2017 . I conducted an email interview with Brian Kelly Chief Security Officer at wellknown managed cloud provider Rackspace to find out what is changing about cloud security in the coming year8212and to see if he agreed with these analysts predictions .

---  Clark Hoyt the New York Times public editor or 8220readers representative8221 addressed my complaint about Linda Greenhouse's reporting of Supreme Court cases in which her husband has participated . Hoyt agrees with my complaint that Greenhouse had a conflict of interest and that the Times did not deal with it properly . But Hoyt makes some odd turns and ends up rather lost . In one of the oddest aspects of his column Hoyt maintains that it is the 8220constant partisan partisan on how newspapers deal with conflicts of interest .

There may well be arguments in support of that position but Hoyt does not provide them for him for him that the paper has to offer the best Greenhouse is supposedly offer him the best that the NY Times has to .

---  In 1997 Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott famously said 8220We are all middle class now . If everyone is middle class does class exist anymore in Britain? And what about the working class the class whose labors powered the Industrial Revolution? Where have they gone The Mineworkers Working class culture in Britain was always strong underground in the coal mines . The working class lost not only jobs but a part of their identity in the 1980s . Margaret Thatcher once declared there was 8220no such thing as society and Thatcher wanted to reorder British public life away from the upper middle and working classes into a nation of consumers owners and shareholders . Owen Jones has written a book about class attitudes in Britain today . He says both parties think the same way in the political consensus in the main political parties today. He says the main consensus in Britain is the way in today’s Britain today. Owen Jones says both political parties think that both parties are the same. The main consensus is both parties. The same way. The consensus in both parties lost out to a main consensus. The way in Britain. The development of a truly classless society with opportunities for all of the British political parties. It is the sort of society that Owen Jones. The kind of society  Underclass is a word that8217s been in vogue in Britain for the past decade as have TV shows that caricature poor uneducated people .

---  The ruling elites in the U.S. have mounted a campaign to shut down platforms given to their critics . The attacks include blacklisting censorship and slandering dissidents as foreign agents for Russia and purveyors of 8220fake news8221 . The corporate elites do not fear Russia and do not have a plausible counterargument . The tactic they are using is as old as the nationstate8212smearing critics as traitors who are in the service of a hostile foreign power . The first and deadliest salvo in the war on dissent came in 1971 when Lewis Powell a corporate attorney and later a Supreme Court justice wrote and circulated a memo among business leaders called 8220Attack on American Free Enterprise System . The memo argued that corporations had to fund sustained campaigns to marginalize or silence those who in 8220the college campus the pulpit the media and the intellectual and literary journals were hostile to corporate interests . Powell attacked Ralph Nader by name . In 1971 the memo became the blueprint for the corporate coup d8217233tat . The military became a de facto blacklist especially the de facto blacklisted especially the universities and the press was used to discredit intellectuals and activists who decried the idea of the . idea of . the . marketplace and the .  Barack Obama rode a wave of bipartisan resentment into office in 2008 then spent eight years betraying the public . Obama's assault on civil liberties including his use of the Espionage Act to prosecute whistleblowers was worse than those carried out by George W Bush . This led in the last presidential campaign to an insurgency by Bernie Sanders which the Democratic Party crushed and the election of Donald Trump . The corporate state was in crisis at the end of the Obama presidency It was widely hated It became vulnerable to attacks by the critics it had pushed to the fringes . The Democratic Party establishment is so zealous in its efforts to discredit its critics as stooges for Moscow and to charge that Russian interference caused its election defeat .
